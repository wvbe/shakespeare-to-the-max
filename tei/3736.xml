            <byline>By a Perſon of Quality.</byline>
            <l>COme hither ye Dreamers of Dreams,</l>
            <l>Ye Soothſayers, Vizards and Witches,</l>
            <l>That puzzle the World with hard Names,</l>
            <l>And without any meaning make Speeches:</l>
            <l>Here's a Lord in the North,</l>
            <l>Near <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Frith;</l>
            <l>Tho little has been ſaid of his Name or his Worth;</l>
            <l>He's ſeen ſuch a Viſion, no Mortal can reach it,</l>
            <l>I challenge the Clan of <hi>Egyptians</hi> to match it.</l>
            <l>And firſt, in the dark it was told him,</l>
            <l>Which might very well appall us,</l>
            <l>That the World was a fighting of old time,</l>
            <l>From <hi>Nimrod</hi> to <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>;</l>
            <l>That it's all Revelation,</l>
            <l>You may pawn your Salvation,</l>
            <l>For the Devil a Hiſtory gives the relation,</l>
            <l>But it's all in the Deeps, no Mortal can reach it,</l>
            <l>We may challenge the Clan of <hi>Egyptians</hi> to match it,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0185702600:2"/>Then <hi>Scotland</hi> comes next on the Stage,</l>
            <l>For in Viſions you muſt not be nice,</l>
            <l>And a skip of three thouſand Years age,</l>
            <l>Is nothing where Men are Conciſe;</l>
            <l>I name it the rather</l>
            <l>Becauſe you may gather,</l>
            <l>How that every Man is the Son of his Father,</l>
            <l>A Truth for the future no Mortal can doubt,</l>
            <l>Whatever they might, before he found it out.</l>
            <l>But heark, now the Wonders begin,</l>
            <l>And take care leaſt the Viſion ſhould fright ye;</l>
            <l>For if it ſhould make you unclean,</l>
            <l>He has not told how he would dight ye.</l>
            <l>Firſt the National Church,</l>
            <l>Left quite in the Lurch,</l>
            <l>Was a truckling down to the Steeple and Porch,</l>
            <l>But what is ſtill worſe, ſhe's afraid of her Friends,</l>
            <l>So Fevers make frantick Men-haſten their Ends.</l>
            <l>Was ever ſuch Conjuring known,</l>
            <l>Or the Church ſo claw'd by the Steeple,</l>
            <l>Non-jurors are her Champions grown,</l>
            <l>And the Prelatiſts vote for the People.</l>
            <l>Proteſters appear</l>
            <l>And the <hi>Jacques</hi> they adhere,</l>
            <l>And Anti-chriſt votes the true Church to ſecure,</l>
            <l>O <hi>Scotland!</hi> Was ever ſuch Conjuring known,</l>
            <l>That the Mitre ſupports the ſame Church pull'd her down.</l>
            <l>Then the Nation in Sack-cloth appear'd,</l>
            <l>And the Viſioneſt ſadly bewail'd her,</l>
            <l>For Miſchiefs the like were ne'er heard,</l>
            <l>Her Priv'lege of Slavery fail'd her.</l>
            <l>For the Mob he complain'd</l>
            <l>That being born Chain'd,</l>
            <l>Bleſt Bondage was loſt, and damn'd Freedom remain'd,</l>
            <l>So with Liberty ſcar'd, and afraid to grow Rich;</l>
            <l>They ſu'd for Repentance in a dolorous Speech.</l>
            <l>And firſt our Amazement 'll increaſe.</l>
            <l>The Souldiers disbanded appear,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0185702600:3"/>Poor Drudges put Prentices to Peace,</l>
            <l>For want of the Bleſſings of War;</l>
            <l>For tho it's in the Book,</l>
            <l>Yet the Scripture miſtook,</l>
            <l>When it told us, our Swords ſhould to Plow-ſhares be broke:</l>
            <l>It might be long ago a Happineſs there,</l>
            <l>But it's plain by the Viſion it's otherwiſe here.</l>
            <l>The Merchants are next on the Stage;</l>
            <l>The Enchantment has circl'd them in;</l>
            <l>For fear they in Wealth ſhould engage,</l>
            <l>They reſolve they'll never begin</l>
            <l>The Burghs are afraid</l>
            <l>They ſhall have too much Trade,</l>
            <l>And the Nation to Plenty be ſafely betray'd,</l>
            <l>So they gravely Addreſs, that to keep them ſecure,</l>
            <l>As you find them, you leave them, both Fooliſh and Poor.</l>
            <l>The next is indeed a ſad Sight,</l>
            <l>The like on't has rarely been known,</l>
            <l>'Twill ruin the Country quite,</l>
            <l>It will never recover its own;</l>
            <l>The Plow Man's undone,</l>
            <l>From Father to Son;</l>
            <l>For a terrible draw-back on Corn will come on,</l>
            <l>In plenty they'll Ship it, be there never ſo much;</l>
            <l>And to load us with Money, ſell all to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>O ye Virgins! (both Sexes) draw near,</l>
            <l>And tho it's but in Spectrum ſhowen,</l>
            <l>In ſympathy lend us a Tear,</l>
            <l>As the Caſe may ſometime be your own;</l>
            <l>The Ladies Condition</l>
            <l>Deſerves your Compaſſion;</l>
            <l>'Tis very ſevere to make Beauty petition:</l>
            <l>Yet here his ſtrange Tragedies turn'd to a Jigg,</l>
            <l>That the Men want Employments, yet the Ladies ſhou'd Beg.</l>
            <l>Then a Crew of old Sailers were brought,</l>
            <l>At their true Benefactors to Rail;</l>
            <l>Their Freight for ſtrange Nations was bought,</l>
            <l>And this will cut off the Entail;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0185702600:4"/>They thought it was hard</l>
            <l>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships to diſcard,</l>
            <l>And to force the poor <hi>Scots</hi> their own Trade to regard,</l>
            <l>For Liberty claims a Freedom to ill,</l>
            <l>And it's hard to get Money againſt a Man's Will</l>
            <l>And now the Exorciſt in turn</l>
            <l>Like a Ghoſt in a Circle ariſes,</l>
            <l>Without any Tears he can mourn.</l>
            <l>He is Extaſies all and Surpriſes.</l>
            <l>But what's wildeſt of all,</l>
            <l>And does ſtrangely appall,</l>
            <l>Two hours he talk'd, and ſaid nothing at all:</l>
            <l>But let drop a few hypocritical Tears,</l>
            <l>So the Crocodale weeps on the Carcaſe ſhe tears;</l>
            <l>Then in ſtrange Hebrew words he bewail'd ye,</l>
            <l>Tho the Jeſt was by few underſtood,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tu quoque mi fili Squadrone,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or in Scots, <hi>the Parliament</hi>'s <hi>wood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So <hi>Coeſar</hi> they ſay,</l>
            <l>Cry'd out in a fray,</l>
            <l>When they kill'd him, becauſe he'd his Country betray,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Brutus</hi> his Country's Liberty ſought,</l>
            <l>Was a Simily e're-ſoon happily brought?</l>
            <l>Thus he rummag'd the Hiſtories old,</l>
            <l>Like the Tale of the Bear, and the Fiddle;</l>
            <l>For as 'twas unluckily told,</l>
            <l>So the Story broke off in the middle.</l>
            <l>Some ſaid my Lord cry'd,</l>
            <l>Tho others deny'd;</l>
            <l>Which Matter of Moment it's hard to decide,</l>
            <l>But here's a more difficult Matter remains,</l>
            <l>To tell if he ſhew'd us leſs Manners or Brains.</l>
