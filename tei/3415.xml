A TALE, FOUNDED ON FACT. <note n="*" place="bottom">King Stephen preſented a Watch to one of his courtiers, ycleped Sm—t, and condeſcended to regulate it with his own royal hands. Sm—t being in a promiſcuous company, enquiry was made after the hour of the day. Watches were drawn out, when the differences were marked, and conſiſted, as uſual, in the variation of ſome minutes, from one to ten or fifteen. The royal watch alone was before the foremoſt an hour and a half, and was conſequently reprobated as heretical. Sm—t, however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that his was right, and <hi>muſt</hi> be right, being regulated by infallible royalty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>

'Tis rude to ſtop a ſtaunch old tory</l>

               <l>With watch in fob, as firſt I ſaid,</l>
               <l>King Stephen ſtrutted o'er the mead,</l>
               <l>And met a courtier ſlim, yet ſleek,</l>
               <l>With foretop high, and ſmirking cheek,</l>
               <l>Supple his loins, his ham-ſtrings weak;</l>
               <l>Who crouch'd, and ſtretch'd his beak before,</l>
               <l>Like gooſe approaching a barn-door.</l>
               <l>"Hold up thy head," King Stephen cried,</l>
               <l>"And walk a while at our left ſide.</l>

Sir courtier! of our courtly train,</l>
               <l>We hold thee, the moſt gallant ſwain;</l>
               <l>Nor is there any ſquire we know,</l>
               <l>Who ſpeaks ſo ſmooth, or bows ſo low;</l>
               <l>Whether from nature, or from art,</l>
               <l>Yet ſure we are thou topp'ſt thy part.</l>
               <l>Here, take this watch, we've ſet it ſo,</l>
               <l>To tell thee when to come and go,</l>
               <l>To fetch and carry as we pleaſe."</l>
               <l>He bow'd, then took it on his knees.</l>
               <l>Some ſix months after (ſcene the ſame)</l>
               <l>With cap in hand our courtier came</l>
               <l>To meet King Stephen in his walk,</l>
               <l>When, as fit prelude to more talk,</l>

The King ſaid, "Courtier, what's o'clock?"</l>
               <l>The courtier, in his true blue frock,</l>
               <l>Making a moſt obſequious ſlide,</l>
               <l>Produc'd his watch with humble pride,</l>
               <l>And, in a ſoft and ſilken tone,</l>
               <l>Cried, "Sire, 'tis half an hour paſt one."</l>
               <l>"Paſt one! odds body," ſaid the King,</l>

               </l>
               <l>King Stephen ſmil'd, and gracious cried,</l>
