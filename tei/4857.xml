            <p>Laced or embroidered Clothes cheap in proportion, and executed with the greateſt elegance, propriety and diſpatch.</p>
            <p>In caſes of emergency a Suit made for a gentleman on one day's notice.—Whole Sets of Liveries executed in two days after receiving the order.</p>
            <p>Although the above Prices are much inferior to Taylors Bills in general, he undertakes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh every article of the beſt quality.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen finding their own Cloth, or ſervants liveries, will be equally acceptable; and when finiſhed, (upon calculation), will be found not to exceed the above eſtimation.</p>
            <p>No ſcruple as to ſizes, like ſome of his advertiſing Brethren, admitting of all that comprehend common ſizes.—Silk Garters to Breeches underſtood.—Ladies Riding Habits and Childrens Clothes made with taſte, and to fit to a Nicety, which is what few Taylors attempt, and fewer perform to ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>A little conſideration muſt be productive of the poſſibility of the above Plan's being executed with honour and juſtice, eſpecially as every article is purchaſed with ready money; the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's ambition extending no further than doing juſtice to his cuſtomers, and procuring a genteel livelihood for his family, in preference to riches.</p>
