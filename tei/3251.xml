            <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>A prolific writer whose work is now largely forgotten, Richard
Polwhele was the author of numerous religious tracts, political satires
and essays, topographical and historical studies, poems, translations,
and biographical and autobiographical sketches. He was born in
Truro, Cornwall, on 6 January 1760 to common but well-to-do
parents: his father, Thomas, maintained a small but ancient estate
two miles outside of town, and his mother, Mary, kept the house a
center of social activity. The poet and satirist John Wolcot (better
known by his <hi>nom de plume</hi>, "Peter Pindar") was an
instructor of Polwhele's at school, and a frequent guest at the
Polwhele home. Wolcot took an active interest in young Richard's
literary aspirations, reading his poems and praising them for their wit,
but at the same time adjuring him to refrain from writing in "damned
epithets." The two must have had a falling-out at some point; years
later, Polwhele would spitefully attack his former mentor in <hi>A
Sketch of Peter Pindar</hi> (1800) (See Appendix I). In addition to
Wolcot, Mary Polwhele had other literary friends, two of whom
Richard met on a visit to Bath and Bristol in 1777: the historian and
radical political pamphleteer Catherine Macaulay, and the poet and
playwright Hannah More. Macaulay, "the English Thucydides," was on
this occasion being honored with a birthday celebration, featuring
elaborate parties, poetry readings, and culminating with the
presentation of a sculpture featuring Macaulay as the muse Clio. 
Richard Polwhele participated in the festivities by composing an ode
for Macaulay, which was published along with five other poems in
April, and which marked Polwhele's debut as a writer. Following the
suggestions of several of his friends, Polwhele soon after published a
volume of poetry entitled <hi>The Fate of Lewellyn</hi>, a work
which did nothing to further his career, and which indeed gave him
an early reputation as a callow and unpromising poet.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1778 Polwhele entered Christ Church, Oxford,
where he remained long enough to be admitted to the study of law,
but not long enough to take his degree; instead he entered the
church, and proceeded to take minor offices in various small parishes
in Cornwall and Devonshire.  His first long-term position was as
curate of Kenton in Devonshire, a post he held from 1782 to 1793.
Here Polwhele cultivated many friends, including several self-styled
literary men who had formed a society for belle lettres in Exeter.
Polwhele became an active member of this group, and served as both
editor and major contributor to its first anthology, <hi>Poems,
Chiefly by Gentlemen of Devonshire and Cornwall</hi> (1792). 
During his years at Kenton Polwhele also completed what was to
become his most acclaimed and enduring work, his translation of the
Greek pastoral poets Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus (1786) (these
were reprinted countless times, and the translation of Theocritus
remained the standard throughout most of the nineteenth century). In
1793 Polwhele published the first of his topographical "histories,"
<hi>Historical Views of Devonshire</hi>, and began publishing his
second, more extensive study, <hi>The History of Devonshire</hi>
(1793- 1806). In the same year, Polwhele suffered the loss of his first
wife, Loveday, and consequently took a brief sabbatical from his
curacy; after a few months at home with his mother, Polwhele
returned to Kenton with his three children, and was soon married
again.</p>
            <pb/>
            <p>Together with his new wife, Mary, Polwhele left Kenton in early
1794 and took an appointment at the parish of Manaccan, near
Helston, Cornwall, where he resided until 1806.  In contrast to
Kenton, Manaccan was a poor parish, and Polwhele found that he
had little income with which to support his ever-growing family, and
few intellectual friends with whom to converse; most of the money
Polwhele earned from his office he had to pour into repairs for the
dilapidated cottage in which he lived, and most of his conversation
took the form of epistles (among his chief correspondents were
Samuel Badcock, Macaulay, William Cowper, Erasmus Darwin, and
Anna Seward). Polwhele's relationship with the literary society at
Exeter also took a bad turn; the anthology of <hi>Essays by a
Society of Gentlemen at Exeter</hi> (1796), edited by Polwhele,
became a source of heated controversy between members of the
group, and resulted in Polwhele dissociating himself from
the others.  Despite these hardships, Polwhele continued to find both
time and energy to write, and indeed composed and published a
prodigious number of poems, essays, and histories during his tenure
at Manaccan. His chief labor during this period was the massive
three-volume <hi>History of Cornwall</hi> (1803), which included
civil and military history, a description of the population, sketches of
literary figures and literary productions, and a glossary of Cornish
language. In addition to this work, Polwhele produced a number of
essays and satires on religious matters, such as <hi>Anecdotes of
Methodism</hi> and <hi>Sir Aaron, or The Flights of
Fanaticism</hi> (both published in 1800), in which he sought to
expose the "follies" of low-church sects; published several poems,
including <hi>The Old English Gentleman</hi> (1797) and 
<hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi> (1798); and frequently contributed
essays and poems to the <hi>Anti-Jacobin Review</hi>.</p>
            <p>Polwhele's literary production slowed significantly during the
next thirty years, largely because he found himself greatly overworked
in his clerical offices. To better support his family, Polwhele found it
necessary to take and hold several positions simultaneously: although
he left Manaccan in 1806, he continued to hold the curacy there as a
nonresident until 1821; he undertook the vicarage of the parish of St. 
Anthony in Meneage in 1809, and held that position until 1828; from
Manaccan he had gone back to Truro to become curate of Kenwyn,
which he supplemented in 1821 with the vicarage of Newlyn East.
During this time he published a few sermons, a few satiric essays and
poems, compiled his <hi>Biographical Sketches in Cornwall</hi>
(1831), and labored on an autobiography.  His last years were spent
on the family estate of Polwhele, where he died on 12 March 1838. </p>
            <p>Although the majority of reviewers found <hi>The Unsex'd
Females</hi> a tedious, lifeless piece of writing (little was said of its
politics), Polwhele's associates at the <hi>Anti-Jacobin
Review</hi> were quick to call it to the attention of reactionary
readers. "The...poem has much of a political cast, and, therefore,
comes peculiarly within <hi>our</hi> region of reviewing," remarks
the anonymous critic (27),</p>
            <p>"And we are happy to see one of the first poets of the day, one
who ranks amongst the foremost for richness of language, vividness of
fancy, and brilliance of imagery, employing his poetical talents, at this
awful crisis of church and state, in vindication of all that is dear to us
as Britons and as Christians (33)."</p>
            <p>The reviewer here acknowledges what he considers the "larger"
purpose of <hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi>, beyond its concern
with a particular group of women: the poem seeks to reaffirm<pb/>
nationalist loyalty and Christian religion in the face of revolutionary  
politics and rationalist secularism.  Unquestionably this is one of
Polwhele's chief concerns, and one which he had found that Thomas
Mathias, author of his acknowledged lodestar, <hi>The Pursuits of
Literature</hi>, shared with him. Polwhele and Mathias, like many
of the religious reactionaries in England in the 1790s, believed that
the Reign of Terror in France was proof patent that Reason is not a
deity, but rather is a false idol worshipped by those human 
beings who have forgotten that they are sinful, wicked creatures direly
in need of providential (both deific and monarchical) direction.
Mathias articulates the position eloquently in the introductory epistle
to <hi>The Pursuits of Literature</hi>:</p>
            <p>"When I have read and thought deeply on the accumulated
horrors, and all the gradations of wickedness and misery, through
which the modern systematic philosophy of Europe has conducted her
illuminated votaries, to the confines of political death and mental
darkness, my mind for a space feels a convulsion, and suffers the
nature of an insurrection. I look around me. I look to human actions,
and to human principles. I consider again and again, what is the
nature and effect of learning and of instruction: what is the doctrine
of evidence, and the foundation of truth....I am told, that human
reason is nearly advanced to full perfection; I am assured, that she is
arrived at the haven, where she would be. I again look around me. I
ask, where is that haven? Where is that steady gale which has
conducted her? I listen, but it is to the tempest: I cast my view
abroad, but the ocean is every where perturbed (xiv-xv)."</p>
            <p>According to Polwhele, Mathias's poem had served as a clarion
call to those "whose politics and even religion have been long
wavering" to examine their values and become "fixed in their
principles" (3); <hi>The Pursuits</hi> was a sermon against the
Revolution and those with revolutionary sympathies, and may indeed
have been the text which most persuaded Polwhele to adopt the
reactionary position. Polwhele's devotion to the project of <hi>The
Pursuits of Literature</hi> continued even after Mathias disparaged
him in a subsequent edition; although Polwhele could no longer
muster up the same praise for the poem itself as he did before the
attack (See Appendix I). In any case, <hi>The Unsex'd
Females</hi> stands among the first in a line of reactionary works
composed by Polwhele, most of the later ones appearing in the pages
of the <hi>Anti-Jacobin Review</hi>.</p>
            <p>Of course <hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi> is much more than
a poem against the French Revolution and against Reason: it is, first
and foremost, a satiric critique of the feminist principles expounded
by Mary Wollstonecraft and her followers. In <hi>A Vindication of
the Rights of Men</hi> (1790), the first polemic (of many, from
various sources) aimed at Edmund Burke's <hi>Reflections on the
Revolution in France</hi> (1790), Wollstonecraft had set forth a
radical critique of British society, which she regarded as particularly
oppressive with regard to women. The views were more fully set forth
in <hi>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</hi> (1792): English
women, she argued, had been assigned straitened roles within society,
had been trivialized as sentimental creatures, and had been denied
access to higher education.  Sentimentalist literature Wollstonecraft
found particularly noxious, for it tended to portray women as
essentially emotional beings, and consequently as inferior to men in
their capacity for rational understanding. This rejection of the
sentimental ideal of femininity is Polwhele's immediate concern in
<hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi>, but throughout the poem he links
Wollstonecraftian feminism with revolutionary politics and
anti-Christian values.</p>
            <pb/>
            <p>Polwhele's attacks on Wollstonecraft's immorality and irreligion
take the form of sallies against her personal affairs. After
Wollstonecraft's death in 1797, her husband, William Godwin, had
put into publication his biographical account of her private life;
<hi>Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of
Woman</hi> was published twice in 1798, and was apparently not
only read by Polwhele, but also reviewed by him for the April 1798
issue of the <hi>European Magazine</hi> (the substantial and
unmistakable similarities between the unsigned review and Polwhele's
footnotes on the <hi>Memoirs</hi> in his poem are discussed in
the notes to the present edition). From Godwin's biography Polwhele
garnered the fodder he needed to take shots at Wollstonecraft's
history of "licentious" love affairs, and particularly her relationships
with the painter Henry Fuseli and the American revolutionary Gilbert
Imlay. According to Polwhele, these liaisons were indicative of the
poor moral character one could only expect to find in a "woman who
has broken through all religious restraints" (28-29), who has rejected
the laws of Nature and of Nature's God: "Nature is the grand basis of
all laws human and divine: and the woman, who has no regard to
nature, either in the decoration of her person, or the culture of
her mind, will soon 'walk after the flesh, in the lust of uncleanness,
and despise government"' (6). The despising of government both by
man and by monarch, the rejection of God and Nature (i.e., the
"natural" intellectual and qualitative differences between the genders)
in favor of Reason and social refiguration, and the abandonment of
domestic duty for the pleasures of sexual self-fulfillment are for
Polwhele all symptoms of the same disease, the "Gallic frenzy" that
has infected and unsexed the English woman.</p>
            <p>Curiously, however, of the eight women Polwhele names as 
"unsexed" (15-20), only two actually fit the Wollstonecraftian model:
Mary Hays and Helen Maria Williams. Hays had been a close friend
of Wollstonecraft (indeed, she had orchestrated her marriage to
Godwin), and had established herself as an equally radical, equally
controversial feminist theorist through the publication of such works
as <hi>Letters and Essays, Moral and Miscellaneous</hi> (1793)
(though this treatise, unlike Wollstonecraft's, emphasized Christian
principles as the basis of its critique of gender/power relations). More
infamous even than Wollstonecraft, Williams had gained notoriety in
England for her <hi>Letters from France, 1792-96</hi> (1796), a
sympathetic account of the Jacobins' rise to power, and for her widely
publicized liaison with fellow radical John Hurford Stone.  But these
two stand quite apart from the other women Polwhele calls into
question. Charlotte Smith, who had indeed once been a French
sympathizer, had by 1798 already become a leading voice among the
reactionaries; in <hi>The Emigrants</hi> (1793), Smith had
expressed her outrage at the massacre of the French aristocrats and
her disillusionment with revolution. Anna Laetitia Barbauld, although
the author of several liberal political works (such as the abolitionist
satire <hi>Epistle to William Wilberforce</hi> [1791]), was hardly
a revolutionary; furthermore, she had no sympathy whatsoever for
Wollstonecraft's feminism, being herself a staunch believer in the
propriety and priority of the male-dominated household, and an
outspoken opponent of the "overeducation" of women. One wonders
why Polwhele mentions her as first among Wollstonecraft's disciples.
Mary Robinson's notoriety stemmed not from her political views (she
was, compared to Wollstone-craft, only fashionally liberal) but from
her affairs, particularly her early liaison with the Prince of Wales. As
for the artists Emma Crewe and Angelica Kauffman, Polwhele can
only accuse them of breaching decorum in their sensual   <pb/>
 designs; and Ann Yearsley, the famous "unlettered"
milkmaid-poet, he upbraids solely for her (probably justified) dispute
with her tutor and literary patron Hannah More over the artistic and
financial control of her work (Yearsley's politics, expressed in poems
such as "Reflections on the Death of Louis XVI" [1793] and "An
Elegy on Marie Antoinette" [1795], Polwhele must have found
impeccable).</p>
            <p>Considering this catalog of the unsexed, one can only conclude
that Polwhele attacks these women not for what they are, but for
what they are not: they are unsexed, unfeminine, either because they
are immodest, or unsentimental, or insubordinate. Women must do
more than simply avoid setting a bad example: they must provide a
positive model of chaste, sentimental, subordinate femininity.
Polwhele therefore provides his reader with a list of women he deems
exemplary among literary ladies. Prominent among them are the
women of the Blue Stocking Circle, the literary society that met for
much of the 1780s in the salons of Elizabeth Montagu. In addition to
Montagu herself, the group consisted of Elizabeth Carter, Hester
Chapone, Hester Thrale Piozzi, Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke,
Horace Walpole, Joshua Reynolds, and many other conservative
notables, and held its meetings without the debaucheries of dancing,
gambling, and alcohol.  Polwhele also mentions favorably the
sentimental novelist Fanny Burney, who in works such as
<hi>Evelina</hi> (1778) and <hi>Camilla</hi> (1796) mixed
"with sparkling humour chaste/ Delicious feelings and the purest
taste" (34); the gothic author Ann Radcliffe, presumably for her
stirring accounts of virtue in distress; the illustrator Diana Beauclerk;
and the poet Anna Seward. This litany of saintly women is sung by "a
voice seraphic" (28), calling the sex away from the perils of
Wollstonecraft, and at its conclusion the reader learns that this has
been the voice of Polwhele's "friend," Hannah More.  Vehemently
opposed to Wollstonecraftian feminism, More believed in a natural
intellectual and psychological difference between genders, and
Polwhele cites approvingly her opinion that "the mind, in each sex,
has some natural kind of bias, which constitutes a distinction
of character; and...the happiness of both depends, in a great measure,
on the preservation and observance of this distinction" (36-37).</p>
            <p>Maintaining the distinction of gender roles is Polwhele's primary
agenda in <hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi>, but this agenda is
caught up with many others. In order to ensure that men and women
behave differently, they must inhabit and operate in different spheres.
If women were allowed to follow their own sexual desires and sleep
with any man they wished, whither the domestic duties of hearth and
home? If women were educated in the same way as men, and busied
themselves with the hard affairs of government, what would become
of the softer sex? And if women lost their femininity and abandoned
their domestic obligations, what would the future hold for English
society? The questions alone must have frightened Polwhele, but
they were not questions he would have to answer; by the turn of the
century Wollstonecraft and her followers had fallen so far into public
disfavor that any fears of revolutionary feminism had been effectively
quelled. But in the nineteenth century, women worked within the
roles provided them -- as beings sentimental and religious,
compassionate and "seraphic" -- to create another, more subversive,
and ultimately more effective feminist program for the refiguration of
society.  Religious groups devoted to causes such as temperance and
the abolition of slavery sprung up on both sides of the Atlantic, and
provided women with opportunities to exert, through the exercise of
their putative moral and spiritual superiority, a substantial amount of
control over the destinies of men, and eventually over  <pb/>
 their own destinies as well. To follow the progress of these
groups -- from the temperance unions, to the suffrage societies, to the
organizations for equal opportunity in education and employment -- is
to trace the development of modern feminism. Locating Polwhele's
poem in the history of feminist thought thus becomes a two-handed
affair: on the one hand, <hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi> stands as
a critique of late eighteenth-century feminism and as a testament to
the seemingly unfailing ability of patriarchal cultures to to use fear
and loathing as tactics in the reiteration and retrenching of their
ideological justification; on the other hand, the very terms in which
Polwhele defines femininity, and the barriers which he sets up to
women's abilities, are those which would ultimately be taken by many
women in the nineteenth century and used as springboards into a new
feminist ideology more subversively radical than Polwhele, or even
Wollstonecraft, could ever have imagined.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX 1: The American Edition (1800)</head>
            <p>
               <hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi> was "re-published" in an
American edition by the firm of Wm.  Cobbett, in New York, in 1800.
How closely Polwhele was involved with the printing of the American
edition is uncertain. On the one hand, the publishing house has taken
pains to present an accurate biographical sketch in the preface, and
add another piece by Polwhele, <hi>A Sketch of Peter
Pindar</hi>. Most of the <hi>Sketch</hi> is taken directly from
an article by Polwhele which appeared in <hi>The
Anti-Jacobin</hi>, but it also contains some original prefatory
remarks; it is at least possible that Polwhele prepared the text
specifically for the American edition. On the other hand, one would
think that had Polwhele worked closely with the Cobbett publishing
house, he would have made sure that they spelled his name correctly;
it is given as "Polewhele" throughout.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Sketch of Peter Pindar</hi> could not be presented in
this edition, unfortunately; but it is of some interest and deserves a
brief discussion. It is ostensibly a review of/attack on Pindar's
<hi>Nil Admirari: Or a Smile at a Bishop</hi> (1799), which was
itself an attack on Hannah More's <hi>Structures on the Modern
System of Female Education</hi> (2 vols., 1799). Pindar, in addition
to attacking More for lack of talent, a tin ear, and suchlike, also
suggests repeatedly that More's treatise on education is nothing more
than a borrowing of the ideas of Dr.  Beilby Porteus, Bishop of
London at that time (hence the title). In the battle between these two
important figures of his youth, Polwhele comes down unequivocally
on the side of More; his "sketch" would be better termed a
"rendering" -- he metaphorically tears Pindar limb from limb. 
Polwhele speaks of the "prostituted muse of Peter Pindar, whose
language and whose sentiments are those of the lowest street-walker
in the purlieus of Pamassus" (57). His attack, however, is not confined
to literary realms in the slightest; it is <hi>highly</hi> personal.
Polwhele admits as much:</p>
            <p>"If in these remarks, our readers should descry something more
than <hi>critical</hi> severity, let them be assured that we speak
not without book, we know the man, we know him <hi>intus et in
cute</hi>; we have long marked the malignant effects of his mind,
have traced him through all his character, and have, in all alike,
found him a fit subject of public execration (55-56)."</p>
            <p>In addition to his other sins, both major and minor (abandoning
clerical orders, not paying for a portrait), Polwhele takes Pindar to
task for libelling his neighbors in the country. One cannot help but
wonder if Polwhele considered himself to be one of those so
libelled.</p>
            <p>Polwhele's <hi>Sketch</hi> is also of interest for its
discussion of <hi>The Pursuits of Literature</hi>. In <hi>Nil
Admirari</hi>, Pindar had also attacked Mathias, by name, as
author of <hi>The Pursuits</hi>; Polwhele's response is to profess
confusion over this, since the name of the author is (officially)
unknown.  He therefore removes Mathias's name from the discussion,
and adds this:</p>
            <p>"Of the <hi>Pursuits of Literature</hi> we have had occasion
to speak, incidentally, more than once; we have declared our
objections to particular parts of it, with freedom; and have censured a
propensity to illiberal sarcasm, and indiscriminate abuse, which the
author appeared to us to indulge in too frequently (61)."</p>
            <p>This is a stronger condemnation of the work than is in <hi>The
Unsex'd Females</hi>, but the reasons behind this are made
apparent immediately thereafter:</p>
            <p>"...we shall boldly declare that we consider the author,
whoever he may be, as an able advocate for religion, morality and
social order; and viewing him in this light, we are decidedly of
opinion, that those writers who have had even just ground of
complaint against him...would act more nobly, and we will add, more
consistently with the principles which they support, if they were to
overlook his defects, and sacrifice their private resentment to their
zeal for promoting the public good...."</p>
            <p>"The writer of this article contributed materially to bring the
<hi>Pursuits of Literature</hi> into notice, at a time when it was
very little known; and from the period to which we allude, the author
must be sensible of a most material alteration in the sale of the work.
Yet was he spoken of, in a subsequent part, in a contemptuous
manner, that might possibly have justified a display of resentment; but
he was incapable of suffering any personal motives to bias his sense
of public duty, or to make him attempt to check the circulation of a
work, the general tendency of which appeared to him to be highly
beneficial (61-62)."</p>
            <p>Polwhele's admiration of Mathias was evidently not
reciprocated.</p>
            <p>The preface to the American edition is given here, its humorous
misspelling intact; it serves as a reminder that Anti-Jacobinism was to
be found on both sides of the Atlantic. In addition, a collation of the
British and American editions is given; mostly consisting of
punctuation and spelling errors, it nonetheless yields a few priceless
gems, the most notable being the substitution of "political" for
"poetical" in the footnote on Ann Yearsley. </p>

            <head>Preface to the American Edition</head>
            <p>We seldom lay down a book, which had commanded our
admiration, without wishing to know something more of the Author
than is to be gathered from the work. This arises, frequently, from
our desire to know whether his character corresponds with the
sentiments he has expressed; whether he adds to his precepts the
powerful force of example. It is to gratify so laudable
a curiosity, that the Republisher of this work does himself the honour
of prefixing to it a few sentences by way of preface.</p>
            <p>MR POLEWHELE was born, in 1760, at the patrimonial estate
of the family, Polewhele, in the county of Cornwall. He was educated
at the neighbouring grammar-school of Truro, became a member of
Christ Church College, took orders, was for years Curate of Kenton,
near Exeter, and is now Rector of Mannacan in Cornwall. He was an
author at a very early age, and has, for some years past, stood high in
the ranks of literature, whether considered as a Divine, an Historian,
a Naturalist, or a Poet, in which last character he is surpassed by very
few.  His genius, however, bright as it is, merits not the applause
which is due to his zeal and orthodoxy. In times like the present,
these are the qualities that render a man valuable to his country,
and in these Mr.  Polewhele yields to no one: to inculcate loyalty and
religion is the great object of all his productions.</p>
            <p>The little Poem, which is here submitted to the public, owed its
origin, it seems, to a passage in the pursuits of Literature. The author
of that celebrated Satire, took occasion to make some very severe,
though very just animadversions on those literary ladies, in Great
Britain, who had thrown aside that modesty, which is the best
characteristic and the most brilliant ornament of their sex, and who,
with unblushing front, had adopted the sentiments and the manners
of the impious amazons of republican France; whence they were, by
the Author of the Pursuits, denominated, "The Unsex'd
Females."</p>
            <p>Mr. Polewhele improves upon the hint, and, with a voice at once
awful and harmonious, endeavors to charm them back to the paths
from which they have strayed. He calls to each and all of them, points
out their deviations, warns them of the certain and fatal
consequences, of which exhibits a fearful example in Mary
Wollstonecraft, from the contemplation of whose disgraceful life and
whose melancholy end he leads them to the chearing society of
another group of Females, who are sufficiently characterised by
placing at their head the incomparable Miss Hannah More.</p>
            <p>To the several parts of the Poem are subjoined Notes,
explanatory and critical; and, it were sincerely to be wished, that
fathers and mothers would take a caution from these notes,
respecting the female productions, which they introduce into their
families; for the approaches of vice are never so dangerous as when it
is introduced by the pen of a sprightly and profligate woman.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX 2: "Sonnet to the Rev. Richard Polwhele," 
by Anna Seward</head>
            <p>The second half of the eighteenth century brought about a
marked shift in the conception of literary address and literary
audience; poets stopped addressing wealthy patrons, and, increasingly,
began to address one another. "Circles" and "acquaintanceships" were
the most common form of discourse; intertextuality --
<hi>dialogue</hi> -- was the order of the day.  Never has there
been a time when "literary society" has been so dominating a
structure, perhaps because at this time both aspects of the term were
at a peak. Prior to this time, the society to which so many
Renaissance and Restoration poets belonged was not exclusively
literary; after this time, the dawn of the mass audience,
and the proliferation of writers in all social classes ended any sense
of a close-knit society.</p>
            <p>Given all this, it is important to note that the dialogue between
Polwhele and his adversaries, as well as that between Polwhele and
his ostensible allies, was an extremely onesided one. His main
adversary, Wollstonecraft, could not defend herself, of course; but of
the myriad of other writers mentioned in <hi>The Unsex'd
Females</hi>, the only direct respondent appears to have been
Mathias, who evidently added a "contemptuous" mention of Polwhele
to a subsequent edition of <hi>The Pursuits of Literature</hi>.
The only other writer willing to enter any sort of dialogue with
Polwhele is Anna Seward. Her "Sonnet," admittedly, is not a defense
of <hi>The Unsex'd Females</hi>; it is a defense of <hi>The
Influence of Local Attachment</hi>, a poem first published by
Polwhele in 1796, with a second edition in 1798 and probably two
more thereafter. The sonnet certainly appeared before 1799, when it
was included in Seward's volume of <hi>Original Sonnets</hi>, but
it is unclear whether it refers to the first or second edition. This is
unfortunate, since it would helpful to know whether Seward's poem
appeared before or after the composition of <hi>The Unsex'd
Females</hi>.  Still, the presence of this poem only underscores
the overwhelming absence of others; it appears that Polwhele was
considered a marginal writer by both those who shared his values and
those who did not. In an era of circles, Polwhele appears to have
been somewhat out of the loop.  The text of the poem has been taken
from <hi>The Poetical Works of Anna Seward</hi>, ed. Sir Walter
Scott, (Edinburgh: Ballantyne, 1810). It should also be noted that
Seward is evidently attempting an homage in style; this sonnet is the
only one of Seward's poems in the Scott edition to have a footnote
attached.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>That ingenious and learned gentleman had seen his
charming Poem absurdly and arrogantly criticised by one of the
periodical Censors.  Amidst other utterly groundless objections, he
accused the poet of unlicensed and affected verbalism, instancing
particularly the words <hi>slumberous</hi>, and
<hi>memorize</hi>. For both, Johnson shews the high authority of
Shakespear, Milton, and Pope; and for the latter, a prose sentence of
eminent beauty by Wotton, thus: -- "Let their lives,
which were bravely lost, be memorized on the full tablets of time."
After accusing Mr.  Polwhele of affectation in using them, the critic
proceeds to assert that such expressions have the effect of a
November fog, in completely annihilating every thing like sense and
beauty in a composition. Now, it is evident, that were they as
unhappily, as, in fact, they are happily used, their mal-influence could
extend only to the sentence in which they are found; and since he
cannot deny that they are clearly intelligible, at least, it is impossible
they can have the obscuring effect of a fog, even upon that single
sentence. The critic who could use such an inapplicable metaphor in
prose, is miserably incompetent to sit in judgment upon poetry, and
under the proud name too of the BRITISH CRITIC. By the same
decider was the author of these poems accused of rendering several
of her passages nonsense by the use of the word thrill: The following
were some of the lines instanced. Speaking of Roubilliac's glorious
monument in Wrexham Church, she says,</p>
            <lg type="sonnet">
               <l>"The sainted maid, amid the bursting tomb,</l>
               <l>"Hears the last trumpet thrill its silent gloom."</l>
               <l>And also,</l>
               <l>"Marks the soft tear from thrill'd remembrance sprung."</l>
               <l>Also,</l>
               <l>"What strains Eolian thrill the dusk expanse."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This critic must be poorly read in Milton, Pope, and Gray, and
indeed, in all our best poets, since in them he might repeatedly find
the word thrill used in the same sense. Johnson thus defines it as a
verb active, "to thrill, to pass with a shuddering sensation. " Our
hearts, or our memory may certainly be thrilled either by pleasure,
pain, surprise, or terror, and so, in the language of poetry, may the
tomb, the air, and other things, which are literally inanimate. --
Milton says, in his hymn on the nativity,</p>
            <lg type="sonnet">
               <l>"Nature, that heard such sound</l>
               <l>"Beneath the hollow round</l>
               <l>"Of Cynthia's seat the airy region thrilling."</l>
               <lb/>
               <l>And Addison,</l>
               <lb/>
               <l>"Ran thro' each nerve, and thrill'd in every vein.</l>
               <lb/>
               <l>And Prior,</l>
               <lb/>
               <l>"His killing pleasure, his extatic smart,</l>
               <l>"And heavenly poison thrilling thro' thy heart."</l>
               <lb/>
               <l>But of similar use of the word thrill, the instances are endless.</l>
