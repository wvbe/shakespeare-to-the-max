               <hi rend="sc">John Durand</hi>.—The Subscriber having from his Infancy 
endeavoured to qualify himself in the Art of historical Painting, 
humbly hopes for the Encouragement from the Gentlemen and Ladies of 
this City and Province, that so elegant and entertaining an Art, 
has always obtain'd from People of the most improved Minds, and 
best Taste and Judgement, in all polite Nations in every Age. 
And tho' he is sensible, that to excel (in this Branch of Painting, 
especially) requires a more ample Fund of universal and accurate 
Knowledge than he can pretend to, in Geometry, Geography, 
Perspective, Anatomy, Expression of Passions, ancient and modern 
History, &amp;c. &amp;c. Yet he hopes, from the good Nature and 
Indulgence of the Gentlemen and Ladies who employ him that his 
humble Attempts, in which his best Endeavours will not be wanting, 
will meet with Acceptance, and give Satisfaction; and he proposes 
to work at as cheap Rates as any Person in America. 

</p>
            <p>To such Gentlemen and Ladies as have thought but little upon this 
Subject, and might only regard painting as a superfluous Ornament, 
I would just observe, that History-painting, besides being 
extremely ornamental, has many important uses. It presents to our 
View, some of the most interesting Scenes recorded in ancient or 
modern History; gives us more lively and perfect Ideas of the 
Things represented, than we could receive from an historical 
account of them; and frequently recals to our Memory, a long Train 
of Events, with which those Representations were connected. They 
shew us a proper Expression of the Passions excited by every Event, 
and have an Effect, the very same in Kind, (but stronger) than a 
fine historical Description of the same Passage would have upon a 
judicious Reader. Men who have distinguished themselves for the 
good of their Country and Mankind, may be set before our Eyes as 
Examples, and to give us their silent Lessons, and besides, every 
judicious Friend and Visitant shares with us in the Advantage and 
Improvement, and increases its Value to ourselves.

               <hi rend="sc">Michael De Bruls</hi>.—For publishing by Subscription, Two 
different water views, and two different land views, of this 
flourishing city of New-York. The editor and engraver, has taken 
great pains, and been very exact in laying down these four 
beautiful prospects, with which the city presents itself to the eye 
of every judicious Beholder. He hopes to meet with encouragement 
from all Gentlemen and Ladies, &amp;c. especially, as nothing of 
this Kind ever has been undertaken before by any body in this part 
of the world. 

</p>
            <p>Conditions of Subscription. 

</p>
            <p>1. These above-mentioned four different views, with the respective 
references, in English, High Dutch and Low Dutch will be curiously 
engraved on a copper plate, of 21 by 12 inches each, and printed on 
best large paper. 

</p>
            <p>2. A plan of the streets, &amp;c. of this city, with their 
respective names, will also be neatly engraved on another copper 
plate, and printed on best large paper. 

</p>
            <p>3. Each subscriber to sign his name, and give his quality and place 
of abode. 

</p>
            <p>4. These four prints will be delivered on or before the last day of 
May next, to be several subscribers at their place of abode, at 
Twenty Shillings, New-York currency; one half to be paid on 
subscribing, the other half on the delivery of the five prints. 

</p>
            <p>5. The subscription will be closed on the 28th day of May next, 
after which none will be sold or disposed of. 

</p>
            <p>6. A separate Pamphlet will be published along with the prints, 
giving an exact account of the wholesome climate, pleasant 
situations, products, &amp;c. of this province, for the benefit of 
the subscribers, which they may chuse, either in English, High 
Dutch, or Low Dutch. 

</p>
            <p>7. The above plates are partly finished engraving. The editor and 
publisher has settled a correspondence in the most noted cities and 
towns in New-York government, New-England, the Jersies, and 
Pennsylvania, for to deliver the prints immediately after 
publication, whereof notice will be given in the public News-Papers 
in New-York, Boston, Philadelphia, &amp;c. 

</p>
            <p>Subscriptions are taken in by W. Weyman, Printer in Broad-street, 
Hugh Gaine, in Hanover-Square, John Holt at Burling's Slip, and 
Michael De Bruls, publisher and engraver of the above plates, at 
the lower end of New-Street, next door to Col. Thody. 

</p>
            <p>P. S. The reason why these above-mentioned four views, with the 
plans of this city, have not been finished and delivered according 
to Advertisement, is, 1st. a great many Gentlemen and Ladies, 
having as yet only promised to subscribe; this my undertaking being 
of a very extraordinary charge to me. 2d. I find a great deal more 
land laid in lots additional to this city, than what I was 
acquainted with, consequently requires more expence and time to 
complete the same; particularly as I am desirous to give 
Satisfaction to all those that have, and may encourage the above 
undertaking, as well as for my recommendation and credit; 
therefore, all Gentlemen, and others are requested to be 
expeditious in subscribing, and giving in their names and places of 
abode as they are intended to be printed, and prefixed to the 
pamphlet.

Philadelphia) the Second Edition of a Map of Pennsilvania, New-Jersey, 
New York and the Three Lower Counties on Delaware, By Lewis 
Evans. 

</p>
            <p>The Determination of the Bounds of Pennsilvania and Maryland, by a 
Decree in Chancery; a new Purchase made of the Indians and the 
Erecting of four new Counties in Pennsilvania, since the first 
Publication of the Map, have made this Edition necessary. And Care 
has been taken to supply the Omissions, and to rectify the Errors 
which have escaped in the former Impression; and the South Side of 
Lake Ontario is now added. 

</p>
            <p>The several Provinces and Counties are distinguished in the plain 
Maps by Division of Lines, and in the Colour'd Ones, by different 
Colours. 

</p>
            <p>Besides what are Common to other Maps, as the Sea-Coast, Rivers, 
Creeks, Mountains, Roads, intermediate Distances of Places, and the 
Situation of Cities, Towns, Villages, &amp;c. there are inserted in 
this, how far the Tide runs up the Rivers, and the Time of the 
High-Water, full and Change, of the greatest Use in Commerce: the 
Variation of the Needle, by several accurate Observations, and the 
Rate of its Decrease, of Use in adjusting old Surveys of Land; the 
greatest Length of Days and Nights, a Table of the Distances 
between the most considerable Towns, besides Barometrical and 
Thermometrical Observations, Accounts of the Weather in this 
Climate, the Production of Lighting and Fogs accounted for: with 
several other Articles recommended by the Curious to the Enquiry of 
the Travellers. 

</p>
            <p>The Smallness of this Map has been very often objected to the 
Author; but if Gentlemen would consider, that they seldom have seen 
Maps of any Parts of Europe to a larger Scale, and that there is 
not a City, Town, or even a Village of six Houses within the 
Compass of the Map, that there are not inserted in it, and that 
Pensilvania, as far as tolerably settled, which is between Delaware 
River, the Lower Counties, Mariland, and the Kittatinny Mountains, 
tho' now divided into eight Counties, is not of Extent equal to 
Yorkshire in South-Britain, they would be induced to think a larger 
Map impertinent; if they did not expect it for other Uses then 
Geography, Physics, History and Commerce. 

</p>
            <p>The Price of the Plain Maps is One Spanish Dollar; of the colour'd 
Ones, on superfine Writing paper, Two Dollars; and there are a few 
on fine Calico, at a Dollar and a Half each. 

</p>
            <p>In Justice to the Buyers of the former Impression, their colour'd 
Maps, tho torn or defaced will be exchanged for the new Edition at 
Five Shillings, and their plain Ones at two Shillings and Six-pence.

daring Infractions of the Non-importation Agreement; his insolent

Resolution obstinately to persevere in counteracting the legal 
Efforts of a brave and free People in support of their inestimable 
Rights ‘alarmed and insenced’ the Inhabitants of this City, 
who dreading the destructive Consequence that might have ensued 
from so dangerous an Example, determined, at a General Meeting held 
on Friday Evening last, to call the said Cooley to Account; and 
prevail on him, If Possible, to desist from his vile Practices, and 
endeavour to bring him to such Concessions as should to them appear 
best calculated to attone for his repeated and unprecedented 
offences. Two Gentlemen were appointed to inform him of the 
Sentiments of the Inhabitants, who required his immediate 
Attendance at their Place of Meeting, and to assure him that no 
injury should be offered to his Person; (to prevent which, every 
imaginable Precaution was taken) but Cooley, (influenced perhaps by 
some ill-disposed and Stupid Adviser) refused to attend the Place 
appointed, and alledged in Excuse for his Non-attendance, ‘that 
he did not think it consistent with his personal Safety to meet 
them There’, at the same Time he expressed a Willingness to make 
the Concessions required, from his Parlour Window. When the 
Inhabitants received this disagreeable Intelligence, they 
immediately proceeded towards his House; but Cooley, apprized of 
their coming, thought proper to decamp, accompanied by a Military 
Gentleman, (who covered his Retreat) sought for a Sanctuary within 
the Fort Walls, which could afford him but an indifferent 
Protection against the keen Reproaches of a guilty Conscience, the 
only Punishment he had to dread. Whilst the Inhabitants were 
assembled in the Fields, M—r P—r ordered a File of Soldiers 
to guard his (Cooley's) House, who were accordingly drawn up before 
his Door, with their Musquets loaded, &amp;c. Whether the Author of 
this unwarrantable Step, designed a compliment to the Magistracy

Place for the Purpose, required his appearance in the Fields, where 
he attended, and publickly acknowledged his Crimes; implored the 
Pardon of his Fellow Citizens; engaged to store an equivalent to

with infinite Reluctance, to address the Public on Account of a 
surrilous Advertisement in the New-York Gazette of Thursday last 
Week, signed by one Andrew Bowne. The Character and Reputation of 
a Man in Trade, being of the most delicate and tender Nature, any 
Attempts to stigmatize it, not founded on Facts, or supported by 
Evidence, will never, I flatter myself, influence the impartial 
Part of Mankind, before the Truth has been scrutinized in a legal 
Manner. But, some Time must elapse before this can be done: And as 
the Audaciousness of the Advertisement may make impressions to my 
Prejudice, I shall endeavour to remove them, by laying all my 
Transactions with Bowne, open to the Public; where by it may easily 
be perceived the Means by which his Brain was so violently heated 
as to overcome his reason. 

</p>
            <p>Andrew Bowne, of Shrewsbury, called on me last Summer, telling me 
Joseph Holmes, of this City, had recommended me to him as an honest 
Silversmith. He then bespoke a Set of Silver Buttons for a Suit of 
Clothes. They were made exactly to his Directions; and when he came 
to fetch them he seemed perfectly pleased with them. Three Weeks 
afterwards he called on me, and desired I would take them back. I 
represented to him how unsaleable Things made after another's Whim 
were; and that before I found a Person of his Taste, Years might 
elapse. He then offered me a Dollar; which I refusing he grew 
passionate, and went away in the greatest Anger. On his Return 
Home, he wrote me the Annexed Letter (No. 1) which I despised, and 
returned no answer to. Last May he wrote me another (No. 2) in both 
which he has been very lavish of Names that no honest Man can well 
brook. I returned him an Answer (No. 3) with a View to pass the 
Affair into Ridicule; but it had a contrary Effect; and the 
Advertisement in Question was produced by it. 

</p>
            <p>Private Affairs, of a trivial and insignificant Nature, are 
unworthy of the Attention of the Public. But when malicious 
Defamation is allowed to blast Characters in a public Newspaper, a 
justification in the same public Manner becomes necessary; This 
Apology, I hope, will plead my Excuse. Benjamin Halsted.—<hi>The

infatuated with a foreign Trade, ever to make any great Progress in 
Manufactures; and unless you sell your Linnen, at least as cheap as 
they can have it from Silesia, Austria, Bohemia, and Russia, thro' 
England, Holland or Hamburg, I fear you will not establish an 
extensive Manufactory:—You live in as plentiful a Country as 
any, and your People might work as cheap: I don't mean in the City 
of New-York; Cities are not calculated for Manufactures, since its 
always dearer living in them than in the Country.—News item in

            <p>I received a Piece of Linnen from the Society:—it being brown, 
I desired my Linnen Draper to get it bleach'd; he told me, that 
during 45 Years that he has been a Draper, he had never seen such 
an excellent Piece of Linnen; that as he had got a Fortune out of 
North America, it gave him Pleasure to hear it was Manufactured 
there, but as a Linnen Draper he was sorry for it. It has been 6 
weeks on the Grass, and the Bleacher says it must be in his Hands 
6 more, before it will be well whiten'd; for that he never saw a 
Piece equal to it, and desired to know of what Fabrick it was. Such 
are the Praises of your Manufacture; I hope soon to see the Day, 
that we shall import great Quantities of Linnen from New-York, into 
this kingdom as well as from Ireland and Scotland, and that Germany 
shall be excluded.—News item in <hi>The New-York Gazette or the

got or saved.

pictures which imitate tapestry. But all their work is not set out 
to shew; she has boxes fill with knit garters and braided shoes. 
She has twenty coverns for side-saddles embroidered with silver 
flowers, and has curtains wrought with gold in various figures, 
which she resolves some time or other to hang up.

the necessity of a little arthmetick; but, unhappily, my Wife has 
discovered that linen wears out, and has bought the Girls three 
little wheels, that they may spin hukkaback for the servants table. 
I remonstrated, that with larger wheels they might dispatch in a 
hour, what must now cost them a day; but she told me, with 
irresistable authority, that any business is better than Idleness; 
that when these wheels are set upon a table, with mats under them, 
they will turn without noise, and keep the Girls upright; that 
great wheels are not fit for Gentlewomen; and that with these, 
small as they are, she does not doubt but that the three Girls, if 
they are kept close, will spin every year as much cloth as would 
cost five pounds, if one was to buy it.—A letter to the Printer

in the Heart of our City, how should we master it?...I propose that 
a Drain, or Brick Channel, may be carried up at Low-Water Mark, 
from under the Long-Bridge, in Broad-Street;...Some may object 
perhaps, that such a Course of Salt Water will spoil the Wells near 
it, and make the Water brackish; even this I question, as it is

delivered, that is, if any part gives way or fails by fair usage, 
he will make it good at his own expence. Those advantages cannot be 
obtained on carriages imported. He has now a considerable stock of 
the best of all materials fit for making carriages. For the above 
reasons, he most humbly requests the encouragement of the public, 
which will be most gratefully acknowledged by him.

illustrate the vain Attempts his Power has made use of, to have 
established it self triumphant; the Flames within seem to discover 
a Disunion of Councils, and their Bursting forth at Top, an 
Indication that their Chiefs or Heads, venting their unruly 
Passions, are accomplishing their own Destruction. The Motto being, 
Tandem vincitur, seems to declare the Virtue, Perseverance, 
Magnanimity and Success of the Morris Family, against all such 
combined Force;...—Letter to the printer in <hi>The New-York

I am well enough know to all of you, for I am a New-Yorker. I don't 
pretend to be a fine Scribe; far from it. I have been otherwise 
employed all my Days, than to have any Time to learn a knack of 
writing well; but yet I think I am not quite so unlearned, but that 
I can write so as to be understood; and as I find myself under a 
Necessity of making my address to you, I hope you will make an 
Allowance for my manner and Stile. 

</p>
            <p>You all know I lately purchased, and many of you have seen my 
Philosophical Optical Machine, lately invented in, and imported 
from London. I have hitherto shewed (out of near 100 Prospects) 
only two Setts, 8 in each of English Palaces, grand Building, and 
Gardens, &amp;c. Every one who has seen them, has paid me Four 
Shillings a Piece for each Set; and I must say, they have gone from 
me well satisfied; their repeated Visits and constant 
Recommendations of the Machine, convince me of what I assert. 

</p>
            <p>But tho' all my Customers seem well pleased (except a very few who 
can approve of Nothing they see others do, or with any Thing but 
what they say themselves or have a Hand in) yet as I understood, 
there were great Numbers who think much of Four Shillings, and 
knowing that there are others who really can't afford it, I began 
last week to show for Two Shillings only, the first eight English 
Prospects; and determined to have shewn them no more here. But last 
Week having been so bad weather, for the most Part, that few People 
cared to stir Abroad, I hereby give Notice, that none may miss an 
Opportunity of seeing the English Prospects, that every Morning 
this Week I will continue to shew the first 8, and every Afternoon 
and Evening, the other 8 of them, to no less than 6 Persons at a 
Time; but if a lesser Number should come, I will leave it to their 
own Generosity, according to the Satisfaction they think they 
receive. The next Monday I will begin to show, on the same easy 
Terms, nine of the French King's Palaces, and so every succeeding 
Week different Ones, in different Parts of the World, till the

battle, capitulated for his bow and quiver—a bauble bought his
life. A British merchant sent him to South-Carolina, where he
was used as a slave. A placid countenance, and submissive
manners, marked his resignation; and preserved him in all
situations, the possession of his arms—the only companions he
had left—the sole objects of his affections. His stateliness
and strength recommended him to Colonel Mott, a humane master, in
whose service he died, in steadfast faith of a certain
resurrection in his native state.

</p>
            <p>The bow and quiver were preserved as relics of a faithful slave,
in the Colonel's family, who gratefully remember the services,
the fortitude, and the fidelity of the trusty, the gentle Iambo.

</p>
            <p>In the campaign of 1781, the widow of Colonel Mott, (who died a
patriot) was banished from her house, on the river Congaree,
then fortified by a British garrison; the garrison was besieged
by a small detachment from the American army, whose approaches
were soon within bow-shot. The widow, who lived in a cottage in
sight of the fort, was informed that the preservation of her
house was the only impediment to its reduction—and she was
informed of the expedients proposed. Here, said she, (presenting
the African bow and quiveri) are the materials—Iambo never
used these arrows and I fear they are poisoned; use them not,
therefore, ever against your enemies—but take the bow, any
arrow will waft the match. Spare not the house, so you expel the
foe. The blazing roof prduced submission—the Britons dropped
their arms—the Americans entered the house, and both joined to
extinquish the flames.

</p>
            <p>The misfortunes of a Prince, and the heroism of a lady, are not
uncommon—the novelty is the Bow—a stem of genuine
bamboo—which, destined for the defence of Liberty in Africa,
served the same cause in America, was preserved by an officer of
the patriot army—presented to Mr. Peale and is not deposited

Admirers and Patrons of the Fine Arts in America, respecting Mr.
Trumbull's Historical Paintings.

</p>
            <p>Mr. Trumbull, who lately returned from Europe, proposes to
describe in a series of Paintings, the most remarkable events
of the late American Revolution. He has in contemplation the
following subjects, viz.
<q>
                  <l>I The Death of Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill.
</l>
                  <l>II The Death of Montgomery in the Attack of Quebec.
</l>
                  <l>III The Congress of 1776 in the Declaration of Independence.
</l>
                  <l>IV The Surrender of the Hessians at Trenton.
</l>
                  <l>V The Death of Mercer at the Battle of Princeton.
</l>
                  <l>VI The Surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga.
</l>
                  <l>VII The Treaty with France.
</l>
                  <l>VIII The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis at York Town.
</l>
                  <l>IX The Signing of the Treaty of Peace.
</l>
                  <l>X The Evacuation of New-York by the British 1783.
</l>
                  <l>XI The Resignation of Gen. Washington.
</l>
                  <l>XII The President received by the Ladies of Trenton at the Triumphal Arch.
</l>
                  <l>XIII The Inauguration of the President.
</l>
               </q>

            </p>
            <p>The Portraits of the principal actors in these great scenes will
be preserved; and Prints will be published of the whole. The two
first of these Subjects are finished; and the Paintings in the
hands of eminent Engravers in Europe. Four others are commenced
some of which are half completed. These, with the remainder of
the work, if prosecuted, will require many years of application,
and a very considerable expence.—It is now to be decided,
whether Mr. Trumbull will meet with such Patronage in America as
will justify him in involving himself in such considerable
expences of Time and Money; or whether he will be obliged to
relinquish a favorite undertaking and return to Europe: where
Subjects of a different nature and more interesting to the
feelings of the People of that Continent, will ensure him
employment in a more profitable, though less agreeable manner. We
understand that the Engravings are to be published in numbers,
containing two each: The price will be three Guineas for every
Print; and, we are told, a subscription for the purpose is
soon to be opened.—<hi>Gazette of the United States</hi>,

February 27. The justly celebrated Trumbull is now busily engaged
in his great undertaking—the productions you may depend
will be a most valuable acquisition to the world—to the
American world in particular. I have seen some of the pieces in
which a few heads and some portraits are finished—the likeness
are perfect—the drawing, Nature Itself—and the designs
sentimental, elevated and just. In short, here is no
risque—the object is sure, and the mind is perfectly
satisfied—it rests in the execution. (Mass. Gen.)

lately finished a very fine bust of General Washington. To be 
enabled to execute the likeness, the artist went to 
Philadlephia, and lived six months in Washington's family. The 
character and attitude of the founder and defender of American 
liberty, of the representative of a happy and peaceful nation, 
of the protector of agriculture, that abundant source of national 
wealth, are happily imagined, and as happily executed in his 
performance. It was particularly this last mentioned character, 
the agriculture, that Houdon had in view. The simple costume of 
the figure, expressly chosen with view, has been much criticised 
in America, where taste is yet in its infancy. The Americans 
wished to contemplate a Roman hero decorated with all the 
attributes of a conqueror whereas Houdon, on the contrary, aimed 
to represent the protector of the arts, of peace and liberty. It 
was the interposition of Washington himself which decided in the 
general assembly the execution of the artists ideas. The figure 
is arrayed in the simple and noble dress of a man in rural 
life, a light plaited vest half buttoned, sandals on his feet, 
with a cloak, fastened on his breast, and flowing over his 
shoulders and back, suited to protect an agricultor from the 
inclemency of the weather. One hand is supported by a staff;

emblematic of his firmness and patriotic virtues, in support of 
the rights of his country. On the stern, in the center of the 
Taffrail, are the arms of the United States, supported by 
Sybele and Neptune—the latter with his left hand resting on 
his Trident, and his right extended over our `Infant Navy,' with 
some attributes of Commerce. The former reclining on a sheaf of

Allegorical Picture, or the Triumph of Liberty, This picture is 
proposed to be 21 inches by 16. In the right of the picture 
is ghe Goddess of Liberty rising to the skies on an Obelisk, 
presenting a crown, to which all the heroes filled with her 
sublime sentiments are worthy to aspire. 

</p>
            <p>The Book of the Law is supported by a cube of the Obelisk 
pointing to the solididy of that moral, `The Rights of Man.' 

</p>
            <p>On the side is little Genie presenting to view, the Marseilles 
Hymn:  On one of the steps of this monument is an urn containing 
the ashes of John James Rousseau. At a little distance is the 
three Divinities accompanied by Liberty, (namely Justice, holding 
the Scales and Sword, Peace, presenting an olive branch, and 
plenty, with a horn full of fruit, an emblematical presage of the 
happiness of the people,) she burns crowns, sceptres, crosses of 
St. Louis spears and titles of nobility, cemented and writ with 
the blood of the human race. 

</p>
            <p>On the other side of the Obelisk are the kings, who are inimical 
to Liberty; they have all a particular expression of countenance, 
that indicates the rage and despair that rankles in their hearts, 
one appears to be on the point of throwing himself headlong down 
a precipice, another on the earth, a third just going to stab 
himself, having the different passions of grief, rage and 
despair strongly depicted in his countenance; and near them is a 
Queen, who by the expression of her eyes visibly discovers the 
rage with which her spirits are agitated. 

</p>
            <p>In the left is a grand tomb, enclosing the names of those 
American Heroes, who have served and died in defence of Liberty 
and their country, such as Franklin, Warren, Montgomery, Laurens, 
Sullivan, Putnam, Scamell, Barber, Mercer, Wooster, Poor and Lee, 
near which is the Genius of the country, in the habit and helmet 
of Minerva, bearing the colours of the Nation, and at her side an 
Eagle, emblematical of America; incense is continually burning at 
the foot of the tomb, where a Priest is discovered singing Hymns 
in praise of these illustrious Heroes, At the bottom of the 
picture is a seven headed Hydra, or Despotism tumbling into 
ruins.

            <p>The Proprietors take the earliest opportunity of announcing to 
the subscribers, that in consequence of a late necessary 
arrangement, the plate intended to have been delivered this day, 
will not appear until the third in succession. The plate of the 
Federal City, nearly completed, and from whence the descriptive 
tour commences, it is judged expedient should be first 
published. Although many circumstances inseparable from the 
establishment of so extensive an undertaking, the first of its 
kind in America, have unavoidably arisen, hitherto to retard its 
commencement; yet it is presumed the selection of objects, the 
attention bestowed in finishing the drawings with neatness, and 
accuracy, the tedious difficult executions of plates of such 
large dimensions together with an ardent desire to render the 
work compleat, will rescue the publishers from the censure of 
unnecessary delay; whose only wish is to gratify the admirers of 
picturesque nature and whose ultimate object will be, not only to 
interest the United States, but the European world, by a general 
display of those captivating, elegant scenes, which are so 
profusely distributed over the American continent. The following 
Drawings are in a state of forwardness. The City of New York, 
The City of Philadelphia. These are to be followed by Bethlehem 
in Pennsylvania, View of the North River, View in Connecticut, 
View in Rhode-Island the second selection of twelve, to compleat 
the series of twenty-four, will, amongst others contain, Port and 
town of Boston in Massachusetts, Charlestown South Carolina,

to great perfection and thinks he could make a sufficient 
quantity to supply the United States. Citizens, consider your 
interest, and encourage American Manufactures. 

</p>
            <p>Those imported are of the Slightest kind, I will engage that 
one of mine, will do more service than 3 of them, and I know by 
experience, that imported ones of the quality of mine cost 18 
shillings per doz. and could not be sold by 25 percent, as low as 
mine. Every dealer in this article will soon find the advantage 
of keeping Halsted's Thimbles, and have the satisfaction of 
knowing that he does his customers justice. Silver and steel 
Bodkins, tooth and ear picks by the doz. or single.—<hi>Diary;

it is obvious, that in this new and rising empire, they may be 
made subservient to the valuable purpose of ascertaining 
descents, perpetuating the memorial of kindred by marriage, and 
pointing to the various branches of the same family. To obviate 
the necessity gentlemen are frequently under in this country of 
sending to Europe for their family coats of arms, which is 
attended with considerable expence and trouble; the subscriber 
has been induced to provide himself, at much cost and pains, with 
a curious collection of books of heraldry, &amp;c. containing 
upwards of seventy thousand coats of arms, he therefore proposes 
to furnish those who may be pleased to apply to him, with their 
arms truly blazoned, at two dollars each. The subscriber intends 
registering the names, places of residence, &amp;c. of every 
person applying to him for his arms, together with the arms which 
shall appear to belong to such person, in a book that will be 
provided for that purpose, which shall be deposited in the 
library of this city, as public property. Gentlemen already in 
possession of their arms, may have them registered on paying one 
dollar. If the arms required should not be found nothing will be 
demanded for the search.

               <hi rend="sc">Upon the Manufacture of Glass</hi>. Bottles, black or green, 
are the most simple of all glass manufacture—the profits in 
making which depends upon the greatest number of workmen being 
employed at the smallest expense of fuel. From eight to sixteen 
blowers can work all at once, at one melting furnace, six feet 
diameter, which will take six cords of wood every twenty four 
hours. The best constructed green glass furnace in this country 
is in New Jersey—where the whole business of smelting, 
blowing, and cooling is done with one fire, by the particular 
construction of the furnace. 

</p>
            <p>White glass may also be made in the same furnace: but it is much 
more curious in its composition; for to make it white, it must 
partake of all the colours—for this reason—in smelting the 
purest materials, they naturally have a greenish and purplish 
tinge; to dislodge which a blackish fossil substance is made use 
of—upon this principle, that one colour in glass making will 
destroy another; so that at last a beautiful glass is produced 
called white; but like the christaline humor of the eye, it 
partakes of all the colours, as may be seen in the best English 
white glass which has a changeableness like soap bubbles; but in 
the best London crown glass, or mirrours, you will not perceive 
any of that sparkling, changeable power, because it would 
destort the object seen through or reflected, on account of 
the refracting power of such glass; therefore this glass is 
made of pure salts and sands only and has a native greyish 
colour, as may be seen by the broken pieces that, like water, 
they may reflect the objects truly. 

</p>
            <p>Crown glass may be made here to greater profit than any other 
glass—on account of the plenty and cheapness of 
materials—the quantity that can be made—and the great 
consumption of it—The method of making which—form and 
deimensions of the furnace—preparation of the materials—I 
shall waive for particular reasons. A Glass Maker.—<hi>Gazette

Genuine air-tight Agitable Lamps, for sale at No. 169, 
Pearl-street nearly opposite the U.S. Bank by John J. Staples 
&amp; son. 

</p>
            <p>These lamps are well worth the attention of every consumer of 
candles, as they give a much better light at less than half the 
expence. 

</p>
            <p>The peculiar advantage of this invention is, that it entirely 
removes the original objection to lamps, which was the great 
inconvenience of spilling oil; but it is curious in these, that 
in the most violent motion held horizontal, or even inverted, 
the oil cannot escape, and by their being made air tight, the 
oil (like the quick-silver in a weather glass) is defended from 
the pressure of the atmosphere, which as well as preventing its 
coagulating, causes it to slip much lighter and further to the 
burners, burn brighter, and if properly trimmed with fresh cotton 
and fine oil, will not want snuffing while burning through twelve 
or fourteen hours continuance. 

</p>
            <p>They will not only give as much clear light and less smoke than 
candles, but are cleaner and safer, which makes them fit for 
parlours, bed-chambers, halls, stair cases, and extremely useful 
for kitchens, stores manufactories, and on board ship. Their 
simplicity, and easy manner of trimming, and particularly the 
small quantity of oil they burn, renders it an object universally 
to be adopted for every place where light is 
required.—<hi>American Minerva</hi>, February 12, 1795.

manufacture of Paper Hangings is brought to so great

costly, and much handsomer than white washing. Said Greenleaf is

</p>
            <p>It is said, that the inhabitants of cold climates are more liable 
to inflammatory and consumptive disorders than those of warm 
climates....and it is a question, whether close or open fire 
places are the wholesomest? Prejudice among the Americans is 
great against those that are close, such as stoves. Whether facts 
are prevalent in support of this bias, may be questions. Perhaps 
the Germans of Pennsylvania, who universally use stoves, are less 
liable to consumptions than people who are accustomed to the open 
chimney fires....The German may be as safe in his extremes, 
as the Indian who heats himself in his hovel by means of hot 
stoves till he drips with sweat, and then plunges into a river 
of cold water....a writer in a British periodical paper...is of 
the opinion, that the pulmonary consumption of Britain is 
chiefly caused by the unequal distribution of heat, by means 
of open coal fires.—<hi>The Diary; or Loudon Register</hi>,

               <hi rend="sc">New Invented Saw Mill</hi>, a patent having been obtained 
for a saw mill on a new construction, it is now offered for 
public inspection, and any person wishing to use the same may 
be supplied with a right on moderate terms. 

</p>
            <p>The advantage of this mill over one constructed with a crank, 
arises from its working by means of a lever of an optional 
length, so applied as to create and up and down or circular 
motion, by this means it has the advantage of ten feet to two, 
of purchase; and the lever being on a balance, has thus a 
tendecy to throw off the friction from the wheels of the 
machinery; The lever runs but on third of the circumference with 
the strain of the saw when cutting, the other two thirds runs 
entirely clear, by which you regain the motion the stroke of the 
saw in some measure retards. 

</p>
            <p>This is allowed to be the only construction which, after 
getting a certain motion also gains power, owing to its leaving 
the works so clear of friction. 

</p>
            <p>The crank at one foot from the centre has to lift the saw and 
frame of perhaps 400 lb wt. before the works can be put in 
motion; when the lever at three feet has not to raise 5 lb. 

</p>
            <p>Ii is supposed that one half of the head of water applied to 
crank mills will do the same execution if applied to one of 
their construction. 

</p>
            <p>This mill will be found to be of great use in a flat country where 
there is no fall of water as it can be easily worked to great 
advantage by horses or oxen. It can also be sucessfully applied 
to the sawing of marble, pumping of water for breweries and 
several other purposes. 

</p>

invention, is referred to the saw mill at Corlears hook, or to

there are many persons who doubt the possibility of securing 
houses, &amp;c. from the ravages or accidental fires, and others 
who admit, yet imagine that a chemical preparation of some kind 
is necessary, think it proper to set the public (for whose 
benefit his inventions are intended) right, of informing them 
briefly, 

</p>
            <p>1. That his method for preventing whole houses or a single room 
from being destroyed by fire, for which he obtained a patent, 
are simple, certain and permanent, and do not depend upon any 
chemical preparation whatever. 

</p>
            <p>2. That he stops the spread of accidental fire, by rendering 
those parts of a house the most exposed to, and the least 
qualified for resisting the force of, fire, secure with solid 
materials, as any pavements. 

</p>
            <p>3. Air being the active principle of fire, he hinders its 
admission and escape by closing the doors and windows and the 
chimney (if there be one in the room where the fire begins) by a 
valve, in consequence of which, any further progress of the fire 
is greatly retarded, if not wholly stopped, by the suffocating 
power of its own smoke. 

</p>
            <p>This chimney valve is so contrived, that on the approach of any 
extraordinary degree of flame, it closes, by which means, if the 
chimney only happens to take fire, it will extinquish itself 
instantly, without giving trouble or alarm to anyone. 

</p>
            <p>4. That it provides for the immediate Retention of the 
accidental fires; a reservoir under the floor of the house, to be 
filled with rain water, in which to augment its extenguishing 
power, he dissolves a quantity of pot ash. This water is to be 
conducted down the stair way, by a pipe, from whence it may on 
emergency be conveyed without loss of time to any part of the 
house where the fire may happen to begin. 

</p>
            <p>5. These reservoirs will be found useful in preserving houses 
from accidental fires that may happen within but also a certain 
defence against the approach of any neighboring conflagration. 
They will also be found an effectual security to high and 
extensive ranges of warehouses, built wholly of timber, which on 
account of their situation on wharfs, &amp;c. cannot always, in 
case of fire, be surrounded by men and engines, collected to 
extinquish the flames. Note. Those who secure their own workmen; 
his price for superintending the securing of a single room, in 
the city, is five dollars. 

</p>
            <p>He also undertakes the remedying any imperfections in the 
ventilation of houses or chimnies, which occassions their 
smoaking. No. 13 Fair Street, New York.—<hi>The Diary; or

               <hi rend="sc">Wages</hi>.—To the Public. A considerable Number of the 
principal Journeymen Carpenters in this City, think it incumbent 
on them to lay before the impartial Public, the following 
Impositions which the Masters have long practiced. 

</p>
            <p>The Master Carpenters have long made it a pratice to employ 
Journeymen, (so very ignorant of their business, that even some 
of them have been at a loss to know the right end of their 
tools,) upon very low wages, while they charge the employer 12s. 
per day, the wages only paid to good workmen, and from which they 
have 1s. 6d. per day; for what reason? Because their ignorant 
Journeymen are taught by us, what the Masters ought to instruct 
them in. 

</p>
            <p>About 12 of these Master Carpenters having agreed to reduce our 
Wages to 9s. per day, but still charging the employer 10s. 6d. 
and positively insist on having the above allowance made them, 
even should the wages be reduced to 6s. per day, we now submit 
our case to every candid Reader, who undoubtedly will justify 
our conduct in putting a stop to such iniquitous practices; 
therefore, in order to do justice to ourselves and the Public in 
general, we a select number of workmen, who know our Business, 
and are determined not to be imposed upon, will engage to finish 
any piece of work that Gentlemen may be pleased to employ us 
upon,...sending orders to Mr. Aaron Aarson's....The Journeymen 
Carpenters. 

</p>
            <p>N.B. The Terms of Hire shall be made perfectly satisfactory, at 
the low charge of Nine Shillings per Day, as we should sooner 
receive our money from the Employer than from any of those 
Masters, whose ungenerous conduct justly merits our

acting as Cockswain. It is impossible to do justice in an 
attempt to describe the scene exhibited on his Excellency's 
approach to the city. Innumerable multitudes thronged the shores, 
the wharves, and the shipping, waiting with pleasing anticipation 
his arrival. His Catholick Majesty's Sloop of War, the Galviston, 
the Ship North Carolina (Mr. Dohrman's) and other vessels were 
dressed, manned and highly decorated. His Excellency's Barge was 
accompanied by several other Barges, in one of which were the 
Hon. the Board of the Treasury, and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, and the Secretary of War, besides a long train of 
vessels and boats from New-Jersey and New-York. As he passed the 
Galviston, she fired a salute of 13 guns. The ship, North 
Carolina, and the Battery, also welcomed his approach with the 
same number. The whole water scene was highly animated—moving 
in regular order—the grand Gala formed an object the most 
interesting imaginable. On his Excellency's arrival at the 
stairs, prepared and ornamented, at Murray's Wharf, for his 
landing, he was saluted by Col. Bauman's artillery, and received 
and congratulated by his Excellency the Governour, and the 
Officers of the State and Corporation—from whence the

               <hi rend="sc">Marine Ventilators</hi> invented by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop, for 
ventilating ships, may justly be numbered with the most important 
nautical improvements. The simplicity, durability, and Compact 
structure of the machines, are peculiarly adapted to the 
purpose for which they were designed; and their constant 
vibration, produced by the motion of the ship alone, will keep the 
air in free circulation throughout the remotest parts of the 
ship. Those who are immediately acquainted with the injurious 
effects of foul air on the health of the persons on board ships, 
and on perishable Cargoes, as well as the frames of ships, will 
justly appreciate their worth. It excites astanishment that a 
subject of such magnitude should have been so long neglected, 
when we take into view, the still more important consideration of 
the fatal effects produced by the introduction of pestilential 
diseases into our ports. Those diseases in many instances are 
doubtless generated on board of ships (not ventilated) by the 
putrid exhalations from perishible materials on board, which 
are ultimately discharged on our shores, and like Pandora's box 
spread disease and desolation thro our flourishing Cities. 

</p>
            <p>These remarks are a result of the beneficial effect experienced 
from two such ventilators on board the brig Benjamin Franklin, 
on her late passage from Bourdeaux. Her Cargo was altogether 
wines, near 800 HHDS. of which were Claret wines; it is liable to 
fermentation, and consequently very considerable loss; the Cargo 
was landed in the most perfect order perhaps ever witnessed on 
a similar Cargo, after filling up the Casks the loss did not 
exceed one and a half per cent. 

</p>
            <p>By the operation of the ventilators the hold was kept perfectly 
cool, the bilge water free from smell, and the paint work not in 
the least discolored. On his voyage previous to the construction 
of the ventilators on board, the reverse of all this was the 
case, and only 90 HHDS. of wine on board.

</p>
            <p>He has made upon an improved plan, and has ready for sale, a few 
of those truly useful Machines, called Bidets, so much used in 
England and France, and so generally in all warm climates; their 
utility is not only in the personal cleanliness and comfort 
attending the use of them, but in the salutary invigorating and 
bracing effect, which the applicatioin of a partial cold Bath 
affords to both sexes. Particularly where the constitution is 
relaxed by nature or accident. The celebrated doctor Graham in 
his admired Lectures upon the preservation of Health and Vigour 
and on the renovating of constitutions injured by luxurious 
excesses, particularly recommends the daily use of Bidets filled 
with the coldest water, and has exhibited various proofs of their 
efficacy in removing imbecility and barreness, which the use of 
all the restorative medicines has failed to produce. 

</p>
            <p>He also makes, on the most improved construction, a small 
convenient apparatus for the purpose of a Shower Bath, which 
from its size can be used in a dressing room or bedchamber 
without any detriment to the room and furniture; the use of 
the shower Bather is recommended by the most eminent physicians, 
particularly where violent shock is required to quicken the 
circulation of the blood, and to brace the constitution 
weakened and relaxed by climate or excess. 

</p>
            <p>Many people who are sensible of the salutary effects of the Cold 
Bath, are prevented from the use of them, from situation and the 
inconvenient distance of a proper place for the purpose; this 
apparatus furnishes that convenience immediately and by the use 
of six or eight gallons of cold water the body is as much 
refreshed, and the diseases, for which bathing is a remedy are 
as effectually relieved by means of the simple machine, and by 
the use of an extensive Cold Bath. 

</p>
            <p>He has also for sale, Willard's much esteemed patent clock Jacks, 
they are valuable above the other roast meat jacks, being 
moveable, and may be used in any room. They require less fire, 
and will roast meat in a shorter time than any other now in use.

</p>
            <p>He has on Hand, a very large and extensive assortment of all kinds

               <hi rend="sc">New York Air Furnace</hi>, Peter T. Curtenius and Co. have 
repaired the New-York Air Furnace, and have procured the best 
workmen together with the necessary apparatus to carry on the 
Manufactory of Cast Iron in the completest and best manner. 
Castings made in an Air Furnace, are allowed by all who are 
acquainted with the nature of Founderies, to be better than what 
is made in a Blast Furnace; because, in an Air Furnace, the ware 
is made out of the softest and best Pig Metal, and, by its 
being melted a second time, the scoria, or dross, is expelled 
and nothing but the pure Metal remains. In a Blast Furnace, the 
castings are made out of the first smelting of the crude Ore, 
and are more or less mixt with dross, which subjects the ware to 
be rough and spongy, and often full of cold shuts; the 
difference, in short, is nearly the same as there is between 
refined and Bloomery Iron. The ware they have made is allowed, 
by good judges, to be as light, as smooth, and as good as any 
imported from Europe. This consideration alone, of the ware being 
as good as the foreign, is a sufficient inducement, for an 
American, to give the preference to the manufactures of his own 
country; but a more powerful argument for the purchaser to give 
it a preference is, that it can be afforded cheaper than the 
imported ware, chiefly owning to a duty of six pounds per ton 
being laid on foreign castings. The ware manufactured at this 
Furnace, consists of the following articles, viz. 

</p>
            <p>Pots and kettles of various sizes from one to fifteen gallons, 
tea kettles, pye pans, skillets, griddles, potash kettles and 
coolers, whaling kettles, boilers for tallow chandlers and sugar 
works, stoves for sugar bakers, mill cases, cast bars for sugar 
works and distilleries, rollers and shears for slitting mills, 
chimney backs, hearth and jamb plates, cast agreeable to any 
pattern that may be sent; close stoves for work shops, Franklin 
stoves neatly decorated with carved work, Bath stoves grates 
elegantly ornamented with carvings, ship's cabouses of the new 
construction, with bake ovens in them, in which the same fire 
that roasts and boils the meat bakes the bread; mill rounds and 
gudgeons, saw mill Cranks, calcining plates for making 
pearlashes, cast iron screws for fulling and paper mills, 
fullers plates cast to any size that may be wanted, sash 
weights, forge hammers and anvils, plow plates, half hundreds, 
quarters, fourteen and elevn pound weights; cart waggon, coach, 
phaeton, chair and sulkey boxes, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. 

</p>
            <p>N.B. Persons who want any backs, or other ware, cast agreeable 
to particular patterns, will please to send their patterns and 
orders to the Furnace, near Mr. Atlee's Brewery or leave them at 
the house of Peter T. Curtenius No. 48, Great Dock street near 
the Exchange.—<hi>New-York Daily Advertiser</hi>, October 17,

            <p>Isaac Atwood and John Hambrow, from Birmingham in England, and

employed in counterfeiting have been found. 

</p>
            <p>The counterfeit French guineas, which are the worst executed, may 
be known by the sound being flat. The hair of the head resembles 
balls or lumps, instead of natural curls, and is too great in 
breadth. These pieces weigh a little more than three penny 
weight, and are made of copper gilded. The counterfeit dollars 
are dated 1782, and to be distinquished by the out line of 
the back of the head, which is not sufficiently round; the 
nostril un-natural, and not enough raised on the outside; the III 
after carolus too small and crouded, and the face too long. Some 
are blanced copper, others of copper silvered, or, as the artists 
express it, boiled. 

</p>
            <p>The counterfeit English guineas are dated 1784, the eye is too 
downcast, and the nose and forehead too erect; the eyebrow not 
raised; the nose too broad, the colour resembling brass, and the 
fleurs de lis in the crown, which they ought not. They seem to 
be a composition of gold, silver and copper, and want but a few 
grains of the English standard weight.—<hi>Independent Journal:

it an object to those families or persons who wish to less the 
expence of that necessary &amp; costly article, while for 
convenience it is useful to all, as a kettle of water for the 
tea may be boiled in 6 minutes, with a sheet of paper, a few 
shavings, or any combustible. It will cook a steak very nicely 
in 3 minutes, also veal cutlets, mutton chops fricasee, hash 
meats of any kind, boil eggs, etc. It is very convenient for 
gentlemen in Chambers as it quite precludes the necessity of 
lighting a fire in the chimney. It is likewise very convenient

they are taken out of the water, in a vessel without a fireplace

Paper, are not acquainted with the real cause of their not being 
weekly supplied with the news for some time past, the Printer

disappointments in his endeavors to obtain it, are the reasons. 
He early last Fall, sent cash to a friend in Philadelphia, 
where he was encouraged to hope for a constant supply; but was 
disappointed though he went there himself, owing to the great 
demand for paper by the printers in that city, who generally 
engross it at the paper mills. He had frequently before sent to 
Boston and Connecticut for paper, where he had received a few 
scatry supplies; and was encouraged last fall to expect a stock 
for winter from Connecticut, having sent value before-hand to 
purchase it: none, however was forwarded by land while the roads 
were passable, but delayed till January, when a number of reams 
were shipped, in order to be landed in Fairfield, which unhappily 
were taken by the enemy. 

</p>
            <p>With much pains and cost, he has obtained a pretty considerable 
stock of paper; and at the request of many of his customers, he 
intends to publish his News-paper in a folio size. The price for 
the ensuing quarter, will be Six Dollars, as it cannot be 
afforded for less, while the necessaries of life continue so 
high; when they fall, the price of the Paper will be lowered 
accordingly. The money to be paid at entrance. If any or all of 
the subscribers for the Packet, would pay Four Shillings each, 
in country products, the old way it will be very agreeable. Those

desire to promote the manufacture of paper in America but 
particularly in this state, take in Linen Rags, either in large 
or small quantities, for the Paper Mills....Pennsylvania employ 
18 or 20 Paper Mills, Jersey 2 or 3, and we have only one in our 
State; and though but one, it can scarcely be supported with 
a sufficient quantity of rags. The reason is obvious, viz. 
inattention in our grave old matrons, and carelessness in those 
of fewer years. It is therefore sincerely wished, that our 
citizens, but particularly the Ladies and Taylors, would be 
careful in reserving all their useless linen fragments for the 
above salutary purpose. And as a further inducement they will be 
pleased to recollect that they will, by so doing be instrumental 
in supporting a species of manufacture which can, with some 
degree of attention be easily brought to perfection in this 
country.—<hi>New-York Packet</hi>, September 25, 1786.

               <hi rend="sc">Fashions</hi>. Before the Croisades cost the Christian world 
so many millions of subjects, there was a sort of uniform dress in 
Europe.—Those who returned from the ineffectual wars of 
Palestine, were the first to bring with them the fashions of the 
East, and the most remarkable of these was the long cloak, which 
in the 12th century reached only to the knee; but before the 
15th century, the nobility assumed a long train, imagining that 
the abasement of the servant gave a greater appearance of 
dignity to the master. But knights and princes only were allowed 
to wear those cloaks, and their consorts the robe, sometimes 
with and without gold. 

</p>
            <p>For the space of above three centuries, people had the appearance 
of quiet members of society; no such thing as a sword by way of 
dress; nobility was noted by a long purse hanging at the girdle, 
a custom maintained by the Highlanders at this day; whereas the 
piece of iron which our modern gentleman now sticks at his side, 
carries with it an air of suspicion and turbulency. 

</p>
            <p>The covering for the head was a hood, with a roll or pad at top, 
and a tail hanging behind. This was worn by the Irish, even early 
in the present century, the peasantry of that nation being the 
last who retained it in Europe. 

</p>
            <p>In Henry the 7th's time, and even in Henry the 8th's, emblazoned 
or party-coloured cloaths were worn, like our present heralds and 
pursuivants, quartered in patches of family arms, as were also 
the bipartite garments, half of one colour, and half of another. 
But things will change, and in the meridian of the latter Princes 
reign, Francis the first introduced the fashion of short clothes, 
like the pantaloon dress, being a doublet short skirted, and 
drawers and stockings all of a piece; this being close, and 
yielding to the body, caused many indecent appearances. Some 
serious people introduced the Swiss breeches, a sort of trunk 
hose, which came down only to the middle of the thighs, and over 
it a half petticoat. To this succeeded the exact dress of our 
running footmen. 

</p>
            <p>As the ladies may be curious to know how their sex was dressed, 
they will be gratified in being told, that in 1409 the head dress 
was a high sugar-loaf bonnet, with a veil fastened to the top 
of it, and hanging down more or less, according to the persons 
rank. The veil of a citizens wife came only to the shoulders, 
that of a knight's lady swept the ground.—In Henry the 
VIIIth's time, the ladies wore little hats, with a feather; from 
that time to the year 1600, succeeded small caps, with aigrettes 
or pompoons. 

</p>
            <p>In 1650, the men took it into their heads that a big belly had 
something majestic in it, on which the women (like the women of 
the present day) immediately fancied that prominent posteriors 
were equally ornamental; then appeared nothing but false big 
bellies, and false big bottoms; and ridiculous as this custom 
was, it lasted near four years. What is very odd, no sooner had 
it began, than the sex seemed to give themselves no farther 
concern about their faces; for they hid them under a mask, never 
failing to put it on when they went abroad; this continued down 
to the end of the last century. The masks were superceded by 
patches, used to such extravagance, as to make the face 
scarcely discernible. To this succeeded <hi>rouge</hi>, copied from 
the Roman Generals, who painted on public triumphs. This custom 
is still retained, with all the other pretty extravagancies 
introduced in the dresses of our modern daughters of Eve, who 
seem totally to forget the naked simplicity of their 
grand-dames.—<hi>Independent Journal: or, the General

dress. Every voluntary action must have an end in view.

inform the public, that they have lately imported, and have for

with all the keys, voice flutes, concert flutes, clarinets, 
hautboys, bassoons, French-horns, trumpets, fifes proper for the

</p>
            <p>The Forte-Piano is become so exceedingly fashionable in Europe that 
few polite families are without it. This much esteemed instrument 
forms an agreeable accompaniment for the female voice, takes up 
but little room, may be moved with ease, and consequently kept 
in tune with little attention—so that it is on that account 
supperior to the harpsi-chord. The improvements which Messrs. 
Dodds and Clause have made in the Forte-Piano, has rendered it 
much more acceptable than those imported. The introduction of 
their new invented hammers and dampers, is acknowledged to be a 
great improvement, as also the means they have taken to prepare 
their wood to stand the effect of our Climatte, which imported 
instruments never do, but are sure to suffer not only from the 
agitation of the vessel, but the saline qualities of the seas. 
One great advantage to the purchaser is, that Messrs. Dodds and 
Claus make it an invariable rule to repair any instrument that 
may prove defective in the workmanship, if applied to within 2 
years after delivery. At this manufactory every kind of musical 
instruments are finished according to the present taste, and 
with the latest improvements, as good and cheap as in the City 
of London. Instruments sold on commission, taken in exchange, let 
out, repaired and tuned, in the best manner and on the most 
reasonable terms. N.B. A good allowance is made to dealers in

most agreeable effect. At six o'clock, P.M. Mr. Busselot began to 
fill the balloon, which exhibited the most beautiful appearance 
to a respectable and numerous company. It rose with some 
difficulty, on account of the breeze having entirely failed; it 
ascended most majestically about 3000 feet, which distance from 
the ground it constantly kept until its fall on the Jersey 
shore, having in the course of 35 minutes vaulted about six

ascension from the prison yard to the aerial regions....At last, 
everything being ready, Mr. Blanchard respectfully took his 
leave of the President, who gave him a folded paper, which we 
suppose to be a recommendation to the inhabitants of whatever 
place he may light upon. After he had taken his leave, the 
president called him back and said something to him that we did 
not hear. Then the aeronaut, having bowed to the Spectators, 
ascended his boat, which was printed blue, and spangled with 
stars on the outside and, holding in his hand a flag with the 
colours of the United States, he threw out part of his ballast, 
and precisely at 5 minutes past 10 o'clock, the balloon rose 
slowly and perpendicularly to soft music, amidst the shouts and 
burst of applause of all the Spectators. The President took off 
his hat, and bowed to him as he ascended....It was indeed a 
spectacle as magnificent as it was new to us, to see this intrepid 
aeronaut majestically rise from the earth without betraying the 
least symptom of fear on his countenance, but smiling on the 
astonished spectators whose hearts were filled with an anxiety he 
did not seem to partake. As he rose, he gracefully moved his 
flag, as taking an affectionate farewell of his friends. `Bon 
Voyage, God bless you, all', was reechoed from every mouth, hats 
waved, hands lifted up, all testified the interests that every 
beholder took in the success of this bold undertaking. For some 
minutes the shouts of applause were suspended, and an awful 
silence best expressed at this moment the feelings of the 
spectators....Indeed we are at a loss to account for the little 
encouragement that Mr. Blanchard has received in this city....We 
are credibly informed that the amount of Subscriptions will fall 
short by 400 £ of reimbursing his expences. Our credit as a 
liberal Nation is at stake....About half past 6 o'clock we were 
happy to see Mr. Blanchard again in this city....he informed us 
his aerial voyage lasted 46 minutes, in which time he ran over a 
space of more than 15 miles, and then descended a little to the 
eastward of Woodbury in the State of New Jersey where he took a 
carriage and returned to Cooper's ferry and was at the 
President's, as we have already mentioned at half past 6 o'clock 
in the evening.—<hi>New-York Daily Advertiser</hi>, January 12,

given Mr. Blanchard the fullest assurances, that the liberality of 
the Citizens of New York was such, that it would be easy to 
raise 3,000 by subscription, as a reward for his sublime aeriel 
flight. This liberality is daily becoming exemplified by the 
increased subscriptions, but the fatigues of waiting on the 
citizens at this very warm season, is very great. G. B. 
particularly solicits, that those liberal ladies and gentlemen, 
who wish to be partakers in the great expence that will attend 
the preparations of this very interesting scene, are requested 
to subscribe on some of the subscription papers which are left at 
the coffee houses and other public places, as soon as possible, 
which will very much fecilitate the undertaking. 

</p>
            <p>It is expected, that the Balloon will be suspended to be seen by 
subscribers, in about two weeks, and the ascention will be made

to inform the subscribers, and other citizens of New-York, that 
the Balloon is arrived from Boston, and that it is at the house

will be erected to suspend the Balloon in with all speed, and the 
Amphitheatre will also be built as soon as possible; and that 
the tickets will be prepared and ready for delivery within a few

no person will lose the present opportunity of purchasing a

it; as it must be expected that the present ascension will be the 
last in America, on account of the great expence attending this

            <p>Description of the Case. 

</p>
            <p>The case is made of the best Mahogany, by a most excellent 
workman. The architecture is of an entire new construction, and 
is of an irregular form very pleasing to the eye, having no 
analogy to the customary method of making clock cases; and will be 
found to form an elegant pattern. The cabinet-makers, Mess. 
Gifford and Scotland, will be intitled to much merit for this 
design and execution, with the Paintings and decoration—On the 
Pedestal appear two beautiful youths, represented playing upon 
flutes, very animated; above these appear a very handsome Lady, 
seated under a rich canopy, (beautifully decorated with drapery) 
playing the Piano-Forte; above, on the top of the canopy a small 
globe appears, surrounded by a beautiful sky with clouds 
interspersed. An Eagle hovering, suspending in its beak, a shield 
with the fifteen united stripes, in one talon an olive branch, in 
the other a bundle of arrows; above these is seen glittering 
rays with fifteen stars interspersed, and over this the eye of 
Providence. On the top of the Case, is seen, in burnished gold, 
in the centre, Fame, with his trumpet, in a handsome attitude; 
on his right, Justice, and on  his left Liberty—very 
handsomely finished. The painting was executed by Mr. Joseph 
Weaver, and the gilding and carving by Mr. Harding, both of this 
city. 

</p>
            <p>This Clock and Case cost upward of Eight Hundred Dollars. 

</p>
            <p>II. A Glass Republican Ship.—This ship is ten inches in 
length, mounts fourteen guns, and with all the rigging is made 
entirely of glass, (the colors and figurehead excepted) all the 
ropes and rigging being very nicely proportioned.

views of the most elegant buildings of ancient Rome, with some of 
it antiquities. Six very handsome paintings of the first kind,

article that has ever been manufactured from the shell of this

evening, Monday Jan 11. Self Moving Carriage. Mr. Perrette, 
Machinist from Paris, and other large towns in Europe, and 
Pensioner to the French Republic, has the pleasure of informing 
the public, that he has a self moving Carriage, which has been 
much applauded by the numerous spectators who have viewed it. 
An Eagle Automaton, suitably caparisoned draws the Carriage 
forward with as much rapidity as though it were drawn by horses; 
The driver seated in the Carriage, holds the reigns, and directs 
the course of this extraordinary Carriage.

            <p>Mr. Perette, intending to exhibit this wonderful piece of 
Mechanism, a few times in this city, respectfully invites the

O'clock on Monday afternoon, being the 8th inst. a very curious 
and extraordinary Philosophical Experiment will be shewn at the 
Museum. A small brass cannon will be charged in the presence of 
the audience apparently with nothing, the gun will then be 
conveyed to an elevated place above peoples heads, and discharge at 
command with a loud report, when no person will be near it, this 
is discharging a cannon without being loaded with powder or 
without its having a vent or without any fire being applied to 
the same. A candle will also be lighted instantly only by turning 
a screw. This beautiful experiment will, I flatter myself, please 
and astonish the audience, and I hope there will be many witness 
to approbate the same. Gardiner Baker Proprietor of Tammany
