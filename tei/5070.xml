               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>FROM many propoſitions diſperſed through
the writings of the ancient geometers, and
more eſpecially from one whole treatiſe, it
appears, that the proceſs, by which they
inveſtigated the ſolutions of their problems, was for
the moſt part the reverſe of the method, whereby
they demonſtrated thoſe ſolutions. But what they
have delivered upon the tangents of curve lines, and
the menſuration of curvilinear ſpaces, does not fall
under this obſervation; for the analyſis, they made
uſe of in theſe caſes, is no where to be met with in
their works. In later times, indeed, a method for
inveſtigating ſuch kind of problems has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
by conſidering all curves, as compoſed of
an infinite number of indiviſible ſtreight lines, and
curvilinear ſpaces, as compoſed in the like manner
of parallelograms. But this being an obſcure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct
conception, it was obnoxious to error.</p>
               <p>SIR Iſaac Newton therefore, to avoid the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
with which this method of indiviſibles was
juſtly charg'd, inſtituted an analyſis for theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
upon other principles. Conſidering magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
not under the notion of being increaſed by a
repeated acceſſion of parts, but as generated by a
continued motion or flux; he diſcovered a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to compare together the velocities, wherewith
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0218900500:5"/>
homogeneous magnitudes increaſe, and thereby has
taught an analyſis free from all obſcurity and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER to facilitate the demonſtrations for
theſe kinds of problems, he invented a ſynthetic form
of reaſoning from the prime and ultimate ratios of the
contemporaneous augments, or decrements of thoſe
magnitudes, which is much more conciſe than the
method of demonſtrating uſed in theſe caſes by the
ancients, yet is equally diſtinct and concluſive.</p>
               <p>OF this analyſis, called by Sir Iſaac Newton his
method of fluxions, and of his doctrine of prime and
ultimate ratios, I intend to write in the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
For though Sir Iſaac Newton has very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
explained both theſe ſubjects, the firſt in his
treatiſe on the Quadrature of curves, and the other in
his Mathematical principles of natural philoſophy;
yet as the author's great brevity has made a more
diffuſive illuſtration not altogether unneceſſary; I
have here endeavoured to conſider more at large
each of theſe methods; whereby, I hope, it will
appear, they have all the accuracy of the ſtricteſt
mathematical demonſtration.</p>

               <head>OF FLUXIONS.</head>
               <p>IN the method of fluxions geometrical mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
are not preſented to the mind, as
compleatly formed at once, but as riſing
gradually before the imagination by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome of their extremes <note n="*" place="bottom">Newt. Introd ad Quad. Curv.</note>.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>NOW, if this
line DE be put in motion (ſuppoſe ſo
as to keep always parallel to itſelf,) as ſoon as it</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>HERE it is obvious, that the velocity, wherewith
the ſpace augments, is not to be underſtood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the degree of ſwiftneſs, with which either the
line FG, or any other line or point appertaining
to the curve actually moves; but as this ſpace, while
the line FG moves on uniformity, will increaſe
more, in the ſame portion of time, at ſome places,
than at others; the terms velocity and celerity are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0218900500:8"/>
applied in a figurative ſenſe to denote the degree,
wherewith this augmentation in every part proceeds.</p>
               <p>BUT we may diveſt the conſideration of the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſpace from this figurative phraſe, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a point ſo to paſs over any ſtreight line IK,
that the length IL meaſured out, while the line
DE is moving from A to F, ſhall augment in the
ſame proportion with the ſpace AFH. For
this line being thus deſcribed faſter or ſlower in
the ſame proportion, as the ſpace receives its aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
the velocity or degree of ſwiftneſs,
wherewith the point deſcribing this line actually
mores, will mark out the degree of celerity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the ſpace every where increaſes. And here
the line IL will preſerve always the ſame analogy
to the ſpace AFH, in ſo much, that, when the line
DE is advanced into any other ſituation MNO,
if IP be to IL in the proportion of the ſpace
AMN to the ſpace AFH, the fluxion of the ſpace
at MN will be to the fluxion thereof at FH, as
the velocity, wherewith the point deſcribing the
line IK moves at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, to the velocity of the ſame
at L. And if any other ſpace QRST be deſcribed
along with the former by the like motion, and at
the ſame time a line VW, ſo that the portion VX
ſhall always have to the length IL the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the ſpace QRST bears to the ſpace AFH;
the fluxion of this latter ſpace at TS will be to the
fluxion of the former at FH, as the velocity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the line VW is deſcribed at X, to the velocity,
wherewith IK is deſcribed at L. It will hereafter
appear, that in all the applications of fluxions to geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical
problems, where ſpaces are concerned, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0218900500:9"/>
more is neceſſary, than to determine the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
wherewith ſuch lines as theſe are deſcribed <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 23.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN the ſame manner may a ſolid ſpace be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to augment with a continual flux, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome plane, whereby it is bounded; and
the velocity of its augmentation (which may be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in like manner) will be the fluxion of that
ſolid.</p>
               <p>FLUXIONS then in general are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities,
with which magnitudes varying by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
motion increaſe or diminiſh; and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
themſelves are reciprocally called the fluents
of thſe fluxions <note n="**" place="bottom">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">

               <p>AND as different fluents may be underſtood to
be deſcribed together in ſuch manner, as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to preſerve ſome one known relation to each
other; the doctrine of fluxions teaches, how to
aſſign at all times the proportion between the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities,
wherewith homogeneous magnitudes, vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus together, augment or diminiſh.</p>
               <p>THIS doctrine alſo reaches on the other hand,
how from the relation known between the fluxions,
to diſcover what relation the fluents themſelves,
bear to each other.</p>
               <p>IT is by means of this proportion only, that
fluxions are applied to geometrical, uſes;, for this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0218900500:10"/>
doctrine never requires any determinate degree of
velocity to be aſſigned for the fluxion of any one
fluent. And that the proportion between the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of magnitudes is aſſignable from the relation
known between the magnitudes themſelves, I now
proceed to ſhew.</p>

But in all theſe caſes the demonſtration
proceeds in like manner:</p>
               <p>THUS have we here made appear, that from
the relation between the lines AE and CF, the
proportion between the velocities, wherewith they
are deſcribed, is diſcoverable; for we have ſhewn,
that the proportion of <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> is the true

<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> augments, to the velocity, wherewith AE,
or <hi>x</hi> is at the ſame time augmented.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>THE points moving on the lines AB, CD
may either move both the ſame way, or one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and the other backwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0218900500:17"/>
IN the firſt place ſuppoſe them to move the ſame
way, advancing forward from A and C; and ſince
ſome given line forms with EI a rectangle equal to
that under AG and CH, ſuppoſe QT × EI
= AG × CH: then, if K, L, M are contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
poſitions of the points moving on the lines AB,
CD, EF, when advanced forward beyond G, H and
I; and N, O, P, three other contemporary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of the ſame points, before they are arrived at
G, H and I; QT × EM will alſo be = AK × CL,
and QT × EP = AN × CO; therefore the rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
under IM (the difference of the lines EI and
EM) and QT will be = AK × HL + CH × GK,
and IP × QT = AN × HO + CH × GN.</p>
               <p>HERE the proportion of the velocity, which the
point moving on AB has at G, to that, which the point
moving on CD has at H, may either keep always
the ſame or continually vary, and one of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities,
ſuppoſe that of the point moving on the
line CD, have to the other a proportion gradually
augmenting; that is, if NG and GK are equal,
HL ſhall either be equal to OH or greater. Here,
ſince IM × QT is = AK × HL + CH × GK,
and IP × QT = AN × HO + CH × GN,
where CH × GK is = CH × GN and AK × HL
in both caſes greater than AN × HO, IM will
be greater than IP; in ſo much that in both theſe
caſes the velocity of the point, wherewith the line
EF is deſcribed, win have to velocity of the
point moving on AB a proportion, gradually
augmenting. Here therefore the line IM will bear to
GK a greater proportion, than the velocity of the
point moving on the line EF, when at I,
bears to the velocity of the point moving on the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0218900500:18"/>
line AB, when at G: and the line PI will have a
leſs proportion to NG, than the velocity, which
the point moving on the line EF, has at I, to the
velocity, which the point moving on the line AB has at G.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>IF poſſible let the velocity, which the point moving
on EF has at I, be to the velocity, which the point
moving on AB has at G, as AG × S + CH × R to

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0218900500:19"/>
TAKE W to GK in the ratio of S to R; then
will AG × S + CH × R be to R × QV as AG × W
+ CH × GK to QV × GK. Here, becauſe the ratio
of the velocity of the point moving on the line CD to
the velocity of the point moving on AB either remains
conſtantly the ſame, or gradually augments, W is
either equal to HL or leſs; but when it is leſs, by
diminiſhing HL the ratio of W to HL may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
greater than any ratio, that can be propoſed,
ſhort of the ratio of equality. The like is true of
die ratio of AG to AK by the diminution of
GK. Therefore let GK and HL be ſo diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the ratio of AG × W to AK × HL ſhall
be greater than the ratio of QV to QT; then the
ratio of AG × W + CH × GK to AK × HL
+ CH × GK, that is, to QT × IM is greater
than the ratio of QV to QT or of QV × IM to
QT × IM; therefore AG × W + CH × GK is
greater than QV × IM; and the ratio of AG × W
+ CH × GK to QV × GK is greater than the
ratio of QV × IM to QV × GK, or of IM to
GK; but the ratio of IM to GK is greater than
that of the velocity, which the point moving on EF
has at I, to the velocity, which the point moving
on AB has at G; therefore the ratio of AG × W
+ CH × GK to QV × GK, or that of AG × S
+ CH × R to QV × R, ſtill more exceeds the ratio
of the velocity at I to the velocity at G; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the ratio of the velocity at I to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
at G is not greater than that of AG × S

               <p>AGAIN, if poſſible let the velocity, which the
point moving on EF has at I, be to the velocity,

which the point moving on AB has at G, as
AG × S + CH × R to the rectangle under R and
ſome line QX greater than QT.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>If the points deſcribing AB and CD move
backwards together, the velocity at I will be the

WE have in our demonſtrations only conſidered
the fluxions of lines; but by theſe the fluxions of
all other quantities are determined. For we have
already obſerved, that the fluxions of ſpaces, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuperficial or ſolid, are analogous to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
wherewith lines are deſcribed, that augment
in the ſame proportion with ſuch ſpaces.</p>
               <p>THUS we have attempted to prove the truth
of the rules, Sir Iſaac Newton has laid down, for
finding the fluxions of quantities, by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the two caſes, on which all the reſt depend, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a method, which from all antiquity has been
allowed as genuine, and univerſally acknowledged
to be free from the leaſt ſhadow of uncertainty.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall hereafter endeavour to make manifeſt,
that Sir Iſaac Newton's own demonſtrations are
equally juſt with theſe, we have here exhibited.
But firſt we ſhall prove, that in all the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this doctrine to the ſolution of geometrical
problems, no other conception concerning fluxions
is neceſſary, than what we have here given. And
for this end it will be ſufficient to ſhew, how fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be applied to the drawing of tangents to
curve lines, and to the menſuration of curvilinear
ſpaces.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>HERE, I ſay, the line AC being advanced to
any ſituation FG, by what has already been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on the nature of fluxions, without any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
conſideration whatever, a tangent may be
aſſigned to the curve at the point G.</p>
               <p>WHEN the point moves on the line AC with
an accelerating velocity, the curve DE will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
to the abſciſſe DB. Now if two other ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
HI and KL of the line AC be taken, one
on each ſide FG, and MGN be drawn parallel to
AB; while the line AC is moving from the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
HI to FG, the point in it will have moved
through the length IM, and while the ſame line
AC moves from FG to KL, the point in it will
have paſſed over the length NL. And ſince the
point moves with an accelerated velocity, IM will
be leſs, and NL greater than the ſpace, which
would have been deſcribed in the ſame time by the
velocity, the point has at G.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>WHEN the point moves on the line AC with
a velocity gradually decreaſing, the curve will be
concave towards the abſciſſe; but in this caſe the
method of reaſoning will be ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>IF the curve DE be the conical parabola, the

                  </gap> (that is, the fluxion of FG) as
T to 2DF; therefore OF is to FG in the ſame

GHIK to be generated at the ſame time by
the motion of the line GH equal to AE or BF, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the line GL in an angle equal to that under
CBD; and let the motion of GH be ſo regulated, that
the parallelogram GHIK be always equal to the
curvilinear ſpace ABC. Then it is evident, by
what has been ſaid above in our explanation of the
nature of fluxions, that the velocity, wherewith
the parallelogram EABF increaſes, is to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
wherewith the parallelogram GHIK, or
wherewith the curvilinear ſpace ABC increaſes;
as the velocity, wherewith the point B moves, to
the velocity, wherewith the point K moves.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, the velocity of the point B is to
the velocity of the point K as BF to BC.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curve line ACZ to recede far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and farther from AD; then it is evident, that
while the parallelogram EABF augments uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the curvilinear ſpace ABC will increaſe faſter
and faſter; therefore in this caſe the point K moves
with a velocity continually accelerated.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>AGAIN, if poſſible, let the velocity of B bear
to the velocity of K a greater proportion than that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0218900500:30"/>
of BF to BC, that is, the proportion of BF to
ſome line S leſs than BC; and let the line TV be
drawn parallel to CB, and greater than S, and the
parallelogram TB be compleated. Here the ratio
of the velocity of the point B to the velocity of the
Point K will be greater than the ratio of BF to
TV, or than the ratio of the parallelogram BW
to the parallelogram BT, therefore ſtill greater
than the ratio of the parallelogram BW to the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilinear
ſpace VTCB. Now if the parallelogram
XYIK be taken equal to the ſpace VTCB, that
the point deſcribing the line GL may have moved
from X to K, while VT has moved to BC; ſince
the parallelogram BW is to the parallelogram XI
as VB to XK, that is, as the velocity, wherewith
the point B has paſſed over VB, to the velocity,
wherewith XK would be deſcribed in the ſame time
with a uniform motion, the velocity of the point
B bears a leſs proportion to the velocity of the point
K, than the parallelogram BW bears to the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram
XI, becauſe XK is deſcribed with an
accelerating velocity: that is, the velocity of the
point B bears a leſs proportion to the velocity of the
point K, than the parallelogram BW bears to the
ſpace VTCB. But the firſt of thoſe ratios was
before found greater than the laſt. Therefore the
velocity of B does not bear to the velocity of K a
greater proportion than that of BF to BC.</p>
               <p>IF the curve line ACZ were of any other form,
the demonſtration would ſtill proceed in the ſame manner.</p>

HENCE it appears, that nothing more is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
towards the menſuration of the curvilinear ſpace
ABC, than to find a line GK ſo related to AB,
that, while they are deſcribed together, the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the point, wherewith AB is deſcribed, ſhall
bear the ſame proportion at any place B to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
wherewith the point deſcribing the other
line GK moves at the correſpondent place K, as
ſome given line AE bears to the ordinate BC of
the curve ACZ.</p>
               <p>THE method of finding ſuch lines is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Sir Iſaac Newton's Treatiſe upon the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature
of Curves.</p>
               <p>FOR example, if ACZ be a conical parabola
as before, and Γ × BC = AB<hi>q</hi>; taking GK =
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the parallelogram HK = <gap reason="math">

                  </gap>, =

being equal to <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the fluxion of GK or
the velocity, wherewith it is deſcribed at K, will be
to the fluxion of AB, or the velocity, wherewith B moves, as <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or BC to GH or AE.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus, as we conceive, ſufficiently
explained, what relates to the proportions between
the velocities, wherewith magnitudes are generated;
nothing now remains, before we proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of our preſent deſign, but to conſider
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0218900500:32"/>
the variations, to which theſe velocities are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>WHEN fluents are not augmented by a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
velocity, it is convenient in many problems
to conſider how theſe velocities vary This varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Sir Iſaac Newton calls the fluxion of the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and alſo the ſecond fluxion of the fluent; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
the fluxions, we have hitherto treated
of, by the name of the firſt fluxions. Theſe ſecond
fluxions may alſo vary in different magnitudes of
the fluent, and the variation of theſe is called the third fluxion of
the fluent. Fourth fluxions are the
changes to which the third are ſubject, and ſo
on <note n="*" place="bottom">Fluxionum (ſcilicet primarum) fluxiones ſeu mutationes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis aut minus celeres fluxiones ſecundas nominare licet, &amp;c. Newt. Quadr. Curv. in Princip.</note>.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>HERE therefore we ſee, that while one quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
flows uniformly, the other is deſcribed with a
varying motion; and the variation in this motion
is called the ſecond fluxion of this quantity.</p>
               <p>IT is evident farther, that in this inſtance, when
<hi>n</hi> is = 2, the variation of the velocity is uniform:
for the velocity keeping always in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>x,</hi> while <hi>x</hi> increaſes uniformly, the velocity
muſt alſo increaſe after the ſame manner. But when <hi>n</hi>
is = 3; ſince the velocity is every where as <hi>x2</hi>, and <hi>x2</hi>
does not increaſe uniformly; neither will the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
augment uniformly. So that it appears by this
example, that the variation in the velocity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
magnitudes increaſe, may alſo vary, and this
variation is called the third fluxion of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>IN the ſame manner may the fluxions of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
orders be conceived; each order being the
variation found in the preceeding one. And the
conſideration of velocities thus perpetually varying,
and their variation itſelf changing, is a uſeful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation;
for moſt, if not all, the bodies, we have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0218900500:34"/>
any acquaintance with, do actually move with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities
thus modified.</p>
               <p>A STONE, for inſtance, in its direct fall towards
the earth has its velocity perpetually augmented;
and in Galileo's Theory of falling Bodies, when
the whole deſcent is performed near the ſurface of
the earth, it is ſuppoſed to receive equal augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of velocity in equal times. In this caſe
therefore the velocity augments uniformly, and the
ſecond fluxion of the line deſcribed by the falling bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will in all parts of that line be the ſame; ſo that
third fluxions cannot take place in this inſtance;
ſince the variation of the velocity ſuffers no change,
but is every where uniform.</p>
               <p>BUT if the ſtone be ſuppoſed to have its gravity
at the beginning of its fall leſs than at the ſurface
of the earth, the variation of its velocity at firſt
will then be leſs than the variation at the end of
its motion; or in other words, the ſecond fluxions
in the beginning and end of its fall would be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;
conſequently, third fluxions would here take
place, ſince the variation would be ſwifter, as the
body in its fall approached the earth.</p>
               <p>THE ſtone in this laſt inſtance then not only
moves with a velocity perpetually varying, as in
the preceeding example, but this variation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
changes. In the true theory of falling bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
neither this laſt variation nor any ſubſequent
one can ever be uniform; ſo that fluxions of every
order do here actually exiſt.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0218900500:35"/>
THE ſame is true of the motion of the planets
in their elliptic orbs; of the motion of light at the
confines of different mediums, and of the motion
of all pendulous bodies.</p>
               <p>IN ſhort, an uniform unchangeable velocity is
not to be met with in any of thoſe bodies, that
fall under our cogniſance; for in order to continue
ſuch a motion as this, it is neceſſary, that they
ſhould not be diſturbed by any force whatever, either
of impulſe or reſiſtance; but we know of no ſpaces,
in which at leaſt one of theſe cauſes of variation
does not operate.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus explained the general concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſecond, third, and following fluxions; and
having ſhewn, that they are applicable to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
which do really occur in all motion,
we are acquainted with; we will now endeavour to
declare the manner of aſſigning them.</p>
               <p>AND in the firſt place ſecond fluxions may be
compared together, as follows. Suppoſe any line
to be ſo deſcribed by motion, that it always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ſame analogy to the firſt fluxion of any
magnitude; then the velocity, wherewith this line
is deſcribed, that is, the fluxion of this line, will
be analogous to the ſecond fluxion of the aforeſaid
magnitude. For it is evident, that this line will
perpetually alter in magnitude in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the fluxion, to which it is analogous, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0218900500:37"/>
In the ſame manner if a line be deſcribed ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
to the ſecond fluxion of any magnitude, the
fluxion of this line will expreſs the third fluxion of
that magnitude, and ſo of all the other orders of
fluxions.</p>
               <p>IN the next place the relation, in which the
ſeveral orders of fluxions ſtand with regard to each
other, will appear by the following propoſition.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>IF now another line KL be deſcribed by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the point M, and if a ſeries of lines be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to this line KL in the like analogy by the
motion of the points N, O, P, ſo that QN be to
ED as the velocity of the point M to the velocity
of the point C, RO to GF as the velocity of the
point N to that of the point D, and SP to HI
as the velocity of the point O to that of F; I ſay,
that if the velocity of the point C has to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the point M always the ſame proportion at
equal diſtances from A and K, that then the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of D to that of N will be in the duplicate of
that proportion; the velocity of F to that of O in
the triplicate of that proportion; the velocity of I
to that of P in the quadruplicate of that proportion,
and ſo on in the ſame order, as far as theſe ſeries of
lines are extended.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the velocity of the point C be always
to the velocity of the point M, as the line T to the
line V, when theſe points are at equal diſtances
from A and K. Then, ſince the times, in which
equal lines are deſcribed, are reciprocally as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities
of the deſcribing points; the time, in which
AC receives any additional increment, will be to
the time, in which KM ſhall have received an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
increment, as V to T.</p>
               <p>NOW ED is always to QN in the proportion
of T to V. Therefore the variation, by increaſe or
diminution that ED ſhall receive to the like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0218900500:39"/>
which QN ſhall receive; while the lines
AC, KM are augmented by equal increments, will
be alſo as T to V. But the time, wherein ED
will receive that variation, to the time, wherein QN
will receive its variation, will be as V to T. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
ſince the velocities, wherewith different
lines are deſcribed, are as the lines themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and as the times of deſcription reciprocally,
the velocity of the point D to that of the point N
will be in the duplicate ratio of T to V.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>AFTER the ſame manner, the velocity of the
point I will appear to have to the velocity of the
point P the quadruplicate of the ratio of T to V.</p>
               <p>BUT from what we have ſaid above, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the velocity of the point D is to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the point N, as the ſecond fluxion of AC
to the ſecond fluxion of KM; the velocity of the
point F to the velocity of the point O, as the
third fluxion of AC to the third fluxion of KM;
and the velocity of the point I to the velocity of
the point P, as the fourth fluxion of AC to the
fourth fluxion of KM. And hence appears the
truth of Sir Iſaac Newton's obſervation at the end of
the firſt propoſition of his book of Quadratures, that
a ſecond fluxion, and the ſecond power of a firſt
fluxion, or the product under two firſt fluxions; a
third fluxion, and the third power of a firſt, or
the product under a firſt and ſecond, and ſo on;
are homologous terms in any equation. For, as it
appears by this propoſition, that if the velocity,
wherewith any fluent is augmented, be in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
increaſed; its ſecond fluxion will increaſe
in the duplicate of that proportion, the third fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the triplicate, and the fourth fluxion in the
quadruplicate of that ſame proportion; it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that the terms in any equation, that ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
a ſecond fluxion, will preſerve always the
ſame proportion to the terms involving the ſecond
power of a firſt fluxion, or the product of two firſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0218900500:41"/>
fluxions; the terms involving a third fluxion will
preſerve the ſame proportion to the terms invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the third power of a firſt, or the product of a
firſt and ſecond, or the product of three firſt fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and the terms containing a fourth fluxion will
keep the ſame proportion to the terms containing
the fourth power of a firſt, the product of a ſecond
and the ſecond power of a firſt, the ſecond power
of a ſecond, or the product of a firſt and third; &amp;c.
however be increaſed or diminiſhed the firſt fluxion,
or the velocity, wherewith the fluents augment.</p>
               <p>IN the problems concerning curve lines, which
relate to the degree of curvature in any point of
thoſe curves, or to the variation of their curvature
in different parts, theſe ſuperior orders of fluxions
are uſeful; for by the inflexion of the curve, whilſt
its abſciſſe flows uniformly, the fluxion of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
muſt continually vary, and thereby will be
attended with theſe ſuperior orders of fluxions.</p>
               <p>FOR example, were it required to compare the
different degrees of curvature either of different
curves, or of the ſame curve in different parts, and
in order thereto a circle ſhould be ſought, whoſe
degree of curvature might be the ſame with that
of any curve propoſed, in any point, that ſhould
be aſſigned; ſuch a circle may be found by the
help of ſecond fluxions. When the abſciſſes of
two curves flow with equal velocity; where the
ordinates have equal firſt fluxions, the tangent;
make equal angles with their reſpective ordinates.
If now the ſecond fluxions of theſe ordinates are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
equal, the curves in thoſe points muſt be equally
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0218900500:42"/>
deflected from their tangents, that is, have equal
degrees of curvature. Upon this principle ſuch
circles, as have here been mentioned, may be found
by the following method.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe the line NO to be ſo deſcribed,

Suppoſe likewiſe the lines QR to be ſo deſcribed,
that the fluxion of AL in the curve ABC ſhall be
to the firſt fluxion of LB, as the ſame given line <hi>e</hi>
to QS in the line QR. Here the firſt fluxions
of IF and LB being equal, NP and QS are equal.
And ſince the ſecond fluxions of IF and LB are
equal, the fluxions of NP and QS are alſo equal.
But NP was = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and by the rules for

                  </gap>, that is, as
<hi>e</hi> × EM<hi>q</hi> to IF<hi>c.</hi> Therefore in the curve ABC
the fluxion of QS to the fluxion of AL will be in
the ſame proportion of <hi>e</hi> × EM<hi>q</hi> to IF<hi>c.</hi> Hence
by finding firſt QS, then its fluxion, from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
expreſſing the nature of the curve ABC, the

the proportion of <hi>e</hi> to IF will be alſo

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0218900500:44"/>
be given, whoſe curvature is equal to the curvature
of the curve ABC at the point B.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>THIS is all we think neceſſary towards giving
a juſt and clear idea of the nature of fluxions,
and for proving the certainty of the deductions
made from them. For it muſt now be manifeſt to
every reader, that mathematical quantities become
the proper object of this doctrine of fluxions, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are ſuppoſed to increaſe by any continued
motion of prolongation, dilatation, expanſion or
other kind of augmentation, provided ſuch augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be directed by ſome general rule, whence
the meaſure of the increaſe of theſe quantities may
from time to time be eſtimated. And when different
homogeneous magnitudes increaſe after this manner
together, one may vary faſter than another. Now
the velocity of increaſe in each quantity, is the
fluxion of that quantity. This is the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Sir Iſaac Newton's appellation of fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Incrementorum velocitates. For this doctrine
does not ſuppoſe the fluents themſelves to have
any motion. Fluxions are not the velocities, with
which the fluents, or even the increments, which
thoſe fluents receive, are themſelves moved; but
the degrees of velocity, wherewith thoſe increments
are generated. Subjects incapable of local motion,
ſuch as fluxions themſelves, may alſo have their
fluxions. In this we do not aſcribe to theſe fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
any actual motion; for to aſcribe motion, or
velocity to what is itſelf only a, velocity, would
be wholly unintelligible. The fluxion of another
fluxion is only a variation in the velocity, which is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0218900500:46"/>
that fluxion. In ſhort, light, heat, ſound, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of bodies, the power of gravity, and whatever
elſe is capable of variation, and of having that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
aſſigned, for this reaſon comes under the
preſent doctrine; nothing more being underſtood
by the fluxion of any ſubject, than the degree of
ſuch its variation.</p>
               <p>TO aſſign the velocities of variation or increaſe
in different homogeneous quantities, it is neceſſary
to compare the degrees of augmentation, which thoſe
quantities receive in equal portions of time; and in
this doctrine of fluxions no farther uſe is made of
ſuch increments: for the application of this doctrine
to geometrical problems depends upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of theſe velocities only. But the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the increments themſelves may be made
ſubſervient to the like uſes upon other principles;
the explanation of which leads us to the ſecond part
of our deſign.</p>

               <head>OF PRIME and ULTIMATE RATIOS.</head>
               <p>THE primary method of comparing together
the magnitudes of rectilinear ſpaces is by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them one upon another: thus all the right lined
ſpaces, which in the firſt book of Euclide are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be equal, are the ſum or difference of ſuch
ſpaces, as would cover one another. This method
cannot be applied in comparing curvilinear ſpaces
with rectilinear ones; becauſe no part whatever of
a curve line can be laid upon a ſtreight line, ſo as
wholly to coincide with it. For this purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ancient geometers made uſe of a method
of reaſoning, ſince commonly called the method of
exhauſtions; which conſiſts in deſcribing upon the
curvilinear ſpace a rectilinear one, which though not
equal to the other, yet might differ leſs from it
than by any the moſt minute difference whatever,
that ſhould be propoſed; and thereby proving, the
two ſpaces, they would compare, could be neither
greater nor leſs than each other.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>HOWEVER, the triangle may be proved not to
be leſs than the circle by the circumſcribed polygon
alſo. For were it leſs, another triangle DEG,
whoſe baſe EG is greater than EF, might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
which ſhould not be greater than the circle.
But a polygon can be circumſcribed about the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the circumference of which ſhall exceed the
circumference of the circle by leſs than any line, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0218900500:50"/>
can be named, conſequently by leſs than FG, that
is, the circumference of the polygon ſhall be leſs than
EG, and the polygon leſs than the triangle DEG;
therefore it is impoſſible, that this triangle ſhould
not exceed the circle, ſince it is greater than the
polygon: conſequently the triangle DEF cannot be leſs than the circle.</p>
               <p>THUS the circle and triangle may be proved
to be equal by comparing them with one polygon
only, and Sir Iſaac Newton has inſtituted upon
this principle a briefer method of conception and
expreſſion for demonſtrating this ſort of propoſitions,
than what was uſed by the ancients; and his ideas
are equally diſtinct, and adequate to the ſubject,
with theirs, though more complex. It became the
firſt writers to chooſe the moſt ſimple form of
expreſſion, and the leaſt compounded ideas poſſible.
But Sir Iſaac Newton thought, he ſhould oblige
the mathematicians by uſing brevity, provided he
introduced no modes of conception difficult to be
comprehended by thoſe, who are not unſkilled in
the ancient methods of writing.</p>
               <p>THE conciſe form, into which Sir Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
has caſt his demonſtrations, may very poſſibly
create a difficulty of apprehenſion in the minds of
ſome unexerciſed in theſe ſubjects. But otherwiſe
his method of demonſtrating by the prime and
ultimate ratios of varying magnitudes is not only
juſt, and free from any defect in itſelf; but eaſily
to be comprehended, at leaſt by thoſe who have
made theſe ſubjects familiar to them by reading the
ancients.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0218900500:51"/>
IN this method any fix'd quantity, which ſome
varying quantity, by a continual augmentation
or diminution, ſhall prepetually approach, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
paſs, is conſidered as the quantity, to which
the varying quantity will at laſt or ultimately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
equal; provided the varying quantity can be
made in its approach to the other to differ from
it by leſs than by any quantity how minute ſoever,
that can be aſſigned <note n="*" place="bottom">Princ. Philoſ. Lib. I. Lern. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>UPON this principle the equality between the
fore-mentioned circle and triangle DEF is at once
deducible. For ſince the polygon circumſcribing
the circle approaches to each according to all the
conditions above ſet down, this polygon is to be
conſidered as ultimately becoming equal to both,
and conſequently they muſt be eſteemed equal to
each other.</p>
               <p>THAT this is a juſt concluſion, is moſt evident.
For if either of theſe magnitudes be ſuppoſed leſs
than the other, this polygon could not approach
to the leaſt within ſome aſſignable diſtance.</p>
               <p>RATIOS alſo may ſo vary, as to be confined
after the ſame manner to ſome determined limit,
and ſuch limit of any ratio is here conſidered as that,
with which the varying ratio will ultimately coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide <note n="**" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0218900500:52"/>
FROM any ratio's having ſuch a limit, it does
not follow, that the variable quantities exhibiting
that ratio have any final magnitude, or even limit,
which they cannot paſs.</p>
               <p>FOR ſuppoſe two magnitudes, B and B + A,
whoſe difference ſhall be A, are each of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
increaſing by equal degrees. It is evident,
that if A remains unchanged, the proportion of
B + A to B is a proportion, that tends nearer and
nearer to the proportion of equality, as B becomes
larger; it is alſo evident, that the proportion of
B + A to B may, by taking B of a ſufficient mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
be brought at laſt nearer to the proportion
of equality, than to any other aſſignable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and conſequently the ratio of equality is to be
conſidered as the ultimate ratio of B + A to B.
The ultimate proportion then of theſe quantities is
here aſſigned, though the quantities themſelves
have no final magnitude.</p>
               <p>THE ſame holds true in decreaſing quantities.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>HERE theſe quadrilaterals can never bear one
to the other the proportion between AB and BE,
nor have either of them any final magnitude, or
even ſo much as a limit, but by the diminution of
the diſtance between DF and AE they diminiſh
continually without end: and the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
AB and BE is for this reaſon called the
ultimate proportion of the two quadrilaterals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the proportion, which thoſe quadrila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terals
can never actually have to each other, but
the limit of that proportion.</p>
               <p>THE quadrilaterals may be continually dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
either by dividing BC in any known propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in G drawing HGI parallel to AE, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
again BG in the like manner, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
this diviſion without end; or elſe the line
DF may be ſuppoſed to advance towards AE
with an uninterrupted motion, 'till the quadrila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terals
quite diſappear, or vaniſh. And under this
latter notion theſe quadrilaterals may very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0218900500:54"/>
be called vaniſhing quantities, ſince they are now
conſidered, as never having any ſtable magnitude,
but decreaſing by a continued motion, 'till they come
to nothing. And ſince the ratio of the quadrila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
ABCD to the quadrilateral BEFC, while
the quadrilaterals diminiſh, approaches to that of
AB to BE in ſuch manner, that this ratio of AB
to BE is the neareſt limit, that can be aſſigned to
the other; it is by no means a forced conception to
conſider the ratio of AB to BE under the notion
of the ratio, wherewith the quadrilaterals vaniſh;
and this ratio may properly be called the ultimate
ratio of two vaniſhing quantities.</p>
               <p>THE reader will perceive, I am endeavouring
to explain Sir Iſaac Newton's expreſſion Ratio ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma

the Latin participle evaneſcens, by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
one vaniſhing, and not by the word evaneſcent,
which having the form of a noun adjective, does
not ſo certainly imply that motion, which ought
here to be kept carefully in mind. The quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterals
ABCD, BEFC become vaniſhing quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
from the time, we firſt aſcribe to them this
perpetual diminution; that is, from that time they
are quantities going to vaniſh. And as during their
diminution they have continually different propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to each other; ſo the ratio between AB and
BE is not to be called merely Ratio harum quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titatum
evaneſcentium, but Ultima ratio <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Princ. Philoſ. pag. 37. 38.</note>.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>HERE I have attempted to explain in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the phraſe Ratio prima quantitatum naſcentium;
but no Engliſh participle occuring to me, whereby
to render the word naſcens, I have been obliged
to uſe circumlocution. Under the preſent concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the quadrilaterals they are to be called naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes,
not only at the very inſtant of their firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
but according to the ſenſe, in which ſuch
participles are uſed in common ſpeech, after the
ſame manner, as when we ſay of a body, which
has lain at reſt, that it is beginning to move,
though it may have been ſome little time in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
on this account we muſt not uſe the ſimple
expreſſion Ratio quantitatum naſcentium; for by
this we ſhall not ſpecify any particular ratio; but to

it Ratio prima quadrilaterûm naſcentium <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Ibid.</note>.</p>

WE ſee here the ſame ratio may be called ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the prime, at other times the ultimate ratio
of the ſame varying quantities, as theſe quantities
are conſidered either under the notion of vaniſhing,
or of being produced before the imagination by an
uninterrupted motion. The doctrine under exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
receives its name from both theſe ways of
epxpreſſion.</p>
               <p>THUS we have given a general idea of the
manner of conception, upon which this doctrine is
built. But as in the former part of this diſcourſe we
confirmed the doctrine of fluxions by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the moſt circumſtantial kind; ſo here, to
remove all diſtruſt concerning the concluſiveneſs of
this method of reaſoning, we ſhall draw out its
firſt principles into a more diffuſive form.</p>
               <p>FOR this purpoſe, we ſhall in the firſt place
define an ultimate magnitude to be the limit, to
which a varying magnitude can approach within
any degree of nearneſs whatever, though it can
never be made abſolutely equal to it.</p>
               <p>THUS the circle diſcourſed of above, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this definition, is to be called the ultimate
magnitude of the polygon circumſcribing it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this polygon, by increasing the number of its
ſides, can be made to differ from the circle, leſs
than by any ſpace, that can be propoſed how ſmall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0218900500:57"/>
ſoever; and yet the polygon can never become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
equal to the circle or leſs.</p>
               <p>IN like manner the circle will be the ultimate
magnitude of the polygon inſcribed, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
only, that as in the firſt caſe the vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
magnitude is always greater, here it will
be leſs than the ultimate magnitude, which is its
limit.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>UPON this definition we may ground the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
propoſition; That, when varying magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0218900500:58"/>
keep conſtantly the ſame proportion to each
other, their ultimate magnitudes are in the ſame
proportion.</p>
               <p>LET A and B be two varying magnitudes,
which keep conſtantly in the ſame proportion to
each other; and let C be the ultimate magnitude
of A, and D the ultimate magnitude of B. I ſay
that C is to D in the ſame proportion.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>NOW, if poſſible, let the ratio of C to D be
greater than that of A to B, that is, ſuppoſe C to
have to ſome magnitude E, greater than D, the
ſame proportion as A has to B. Since C is the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
magnitude of A in the ſenſe of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
definition, A can be made to approach nearer
to C than by any difference, that can be propoſed,
but can never become equal to it, or leſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſince C is to E as A to B, B will always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
E; conſequently can never approach to D ſo
near as by the exceſs of E above D: which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.
For ſince D is ſuppoſed the ultimate mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0218900500:59"/>
of B, it can be approached by B nearer than
by any aſſignable difference.</p>
               <p>AFTER the ſame manner, neither can the ratio
of D to C be greater than that of B to A.</p>
               <p>IF the varying magnitude A be leſs than C, it
follows, in like manner, that neither the ratio of C
to D can be leſs than that of A to B, nor the ratio
of D to C leſs than that of B to A.</p>
               <p>IT is an evident corollary from this propoſition,
that the ultimate magnitudes of the ſame or equal
varying magnitudes are equal.</p>
               <p>NOW from this propoſition the fore-mentioned
equality between the circle and triangle DEF will
again readily appear. For the circle being the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
magnitude of the polygon, and the triangle
DEF the ultimate magnitude of the triangle
DEG; ſince the polygon and the triangle DEG
are equal, by this propoſition the circle and triangle
DEF will be alſo equal.</p>
               <p>IF the preceeding propoſition be admitted, as a
genuine deduction from the definition, upon which
it is grounded; this demonſtration of the equality
of the circle and triangle cannot be excepted to.
For no objection can lie againſt the definition itſelf,
as no inference is there deduced, but only the ſenſe
explained of the term defined in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0218900500:60"/>
THE other part of this method, which concerns
varying ratios, may be put into the ſame form by
defining ultimate ratios as follows.</p>
               <p>IF there be two quantities, that are (one or both)
continually varying, either by being continually
augmented, or continually diminiſhed; and if the
proportion, they bear to each other, does by this
means perpetually vary, but in ſuch a manner, that
it conſtantly approaches nearer and nearer to ſome
determined proportion, and can alſo be brought at
laſt in its approach nearer to this determined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
than to any other, that can be aſſigned,
but can never paſs it: this determined proportion
is then called the ultimate proportion, or the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratio of thoſe varying quantities.</p>
               <p>TO this definition of the ſenſe, in which the
term ultimate ratio, or ultimate proportion is to
be underſtood, we muſt ſubjoin the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
That all the ultimate ratios of the ſame
varying ratio are the ſame with each other.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the ratio of A to B continually varies
by the variation of one or both of the terms A and
B. If the ratio of C to D be the ultimate ratio of
A to B, and the ratio of E to F be likewiſe the
ultimate ratio of the ſame; I ſay, the ratio of C
to D is the ſame with the ratio of E to F.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0218900500:61"/>
IF poſſible, let the ratio of E to F differ from
that of C to D. Since the ratio of C to D is the
ultimate ratio of A to B, the ratio of A to B, in its
approach to that of C to D, can be brought at laſt
nearer to it, than to any other whatever. Therefore
if the ratio of E to F differ from that of C to D,
the ratio of A to B will either paſs that of E to F,
or can never approach ſo near to it, as to the ratio
of C to D: in ſo much that the ratio of E to F
cannot be the ultimate ratio of A to B, in the ſenſe
of this definition.</p>
               <p>THE two definitions here ſet down, together
with the general propoſitions annexed to them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the whole foundation of this method, we
are now explaining.</p>
               <p>WE find in former writers ſome attempts toward
ſo much of this method, as depends upon the firſt
definition. Lucas Valerius in a moſt excellent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
on the Center of gravity of ſolid bodies, has
given a propoſition nothing different, but in the
form of the expreſſion, from that we have ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our firſt definition; from which he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
with brevity and elegance his propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the menſuration and center of gravity of the
ſphere, ſpheroid, parabolical and hyperbolical co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noids.
This author writ before the doctrine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibles
was propoſed to the world. And ſince,
Andrew Tacquet, in his treatiſe on the Cylindrical
and annular ſolids, has made the ſame propoſition,
though ſomething differently expreſſed, the baſis
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0218900500:62"/>
of his demonſtrations at the ſame time very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
expoſing the inconcluſiveneſs of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from indiviſibles. However, the conſideration
of the limits of varying proportions, when the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
expreſſing thoſe proportions have themſelves
no limits, which renders this method of prime and
ultimate ratios much more extenſive, we owe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to Sir Iſaac Newton. That this method, as
thus compleated, is applicable not only to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
treated by the ancients in the method of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtions,
but to many others alſo of the greateſt
importance, appears from our author's immortal
treatiſe on the Mathematical principles of natural
philoſophy.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, we ſhall farther illuſtrate
this doctrine in applying it to the ſame general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
as thoſe, whereby the uſe of fluxions was
above exemplified.</p>
               <p>WE have already given one inſtance of its uſe in
determining the dimenſions of curvilinear ſpaces; we
ſhall now ſet forth the ſame by a more general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>LET ABC be a curve line, its abſciſſe AD, and
an ordinate DB. If the parallelogram EFGH,
formed upon the given line EF under the ſame
angle, as the ordinates of the curve make with its
abſciſſe, be in all parts ſo related to the curve, that
the ultimate ratio of any portion of the abſciſſe
AD to the correſpondent portion of the line EH,
ſhall be that of the given line EF to the ordinate
of the curve at the beginning of that portion of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0218900500:63"/>
abſciſſe then will the curvilinear ſpace ADB be
equal to the parallelogram EG.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0218900500:66"/>
SUPPOSE the curve ABC were a cubical para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola
convex to the abſciſſe, that is, ſuppoſe Θ
a given line, and Θ<hi>q</hi> × LM = AL <hi>c.</hi> If EH be
= <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> × EF, then the parallelogram EG will
be equal to the ſpace ADB.</p>
               <p>As EH is = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ER will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and ET = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, conſequently RT = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Therefore the parallelogram EG is here ſo related
in all parts to the curve, that LN is to RT as Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF
to AL<hi>c</hi> + ¼ AL<hi>q</hi> × LN + AL × LN<hi>q</hi> + ¼ LN<hi>c.</hi>
Now it is evident, that the ratio of LN to RT can
never be ſo great as the ratio of Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF to AL<hi>c</hi>;
but yet, by diminiſhing LN, the ratio of LN to
RT may at laſt be brought nearer to this ratio
than to any other whatever, that ſhould be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Conſequently by the preceeding definition of
what is to be underſtood by an ultimate ratio, the
ratio of Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF to AL<hi>c</hi> is the ultimate ratio of
LN to RT. But AL<hi>c</hi> being = Θ<hi>q</hi> × LM,
Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF is to AL<hi>c</hi> as EF to LM. Therefore
the ratio of EF to LM is the ultimate ratio of
LN to RT. Conſequently, by the preceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
propoſition, the parallelogram EG is equal
to the curvilinear ſpace ADB. And this paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram
is equal to ¼ AD × DB.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0218900500:67"/>
AGAIN this method is equally uſeful in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the ſituation of the tangents to curve lines.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curve ABC again to be a cubical
parabola, where BF is = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and GH =
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here HK will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
therefore HK is to FG, or BK, as 3 AF × AG +
FG<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q.</hi> Conſequently the ratio of HK to BK
can never be ſo ſmall as the ratio of 3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q</hi>;
but by diminiſhing BK it may be brought nearer to
that ratio, than to any other whatever; that is, the
ratio of 3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q</hi> is the ultimate ratio of HK
to KB. Therefore, if BF bear to FE the ratio of 3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q,</hi> the line BE will touch the curve
in B: and EF will be equal to ⅓ AF.</p>
               <p>AFTER the ſituation of the tangent has been
thus determined, the magnitude of HI, the part
of the ordinate intercepted between the tangent and
the curve, will be known. For example, in this
inſtance ſince BF is to FE, that is IK to FG, as
3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q,</hi> IK will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
HK being = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, HI will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0218900500:69"/>
be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Now by this line HI may the curvature of curve
lines be compared.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curve CBD to be the cubical pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabola
as before, where Z<hi>q</hi> × FB is = CF<hi>c,</hi> then
KG will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hence LK
(= <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But it
is evident, that in a given ſituation of the tangent
AB the ratio of BK<hi>q</hi> to FI<hi>q</hi> is given; therefore
LK will be reciprocally as 3CF + FI, and will
continually increaſe, as the point G approaches to
the point B, but can never be ſo great, as to equal
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; yet by the near approach of G
to B, LK may be brought nearer to this quantity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0218900500:71"/>
than by any difference, that can be propoſed.
Therefore, by our former definition of ultimate
magnitudes, <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the ultimate mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of LK. Conſequently, if BM be taken
equal to this <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the circle deſcribed
through M is that required.</p>
               <p>WE have now gone through all, we think need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for illuſtrating the doctrine of prime and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratios; and by the definitions, we have given of
ultimate magnitudes and proportions, compared with
the inſtances, we have ſubjoined, of the application
of this doctrine to geometrical problems, we hope
our readers cannot fail of forming ſo diſtinct a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of this method of reaſoning, that it ſhall

with the moſt unexceptionable demonſtration.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE we ſhall in the next place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

                  </gap>. Here, as the firſt of theſe equations exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
the relation between the three quanties <hi>x, y, z,</hi>
as far as the ſame can be expreſſed by a ſingle equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo this ſecond equation, with the aſſiſtance of
the firſt, will expreſs the relation between the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

may be taken out of the latter; whence will

relation between the ſeveral increments; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
if <hi>o</hi> be a given quantity, this equation will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
expreſs the relation between the velocities,
wherewith theſe ſeveral increments are generated
reſpectively by a uniform motion. And this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being divided by <hi>o</hi> will be reduced to more
ſimple terms, and yet will equally expreſs the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe velocities; and then the equation will
become <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Now let us form an equation out of the terms of
this, from which the quantity <hi>o</hi> is abſent. This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
will be <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                  </gap>. It is evident, that
this equation does not expreſs the relation of the
forementioned velocities; yet by the diminution of
<hi>o</hi> this equation may come within any degree of
expreſſing that relation. Therefore, by what has
been ſo often inculcated, this equation will expreſs
the ultimate relation of theſe velocities. But the
fluxions of the quantities <hi>x, y, z</hi> are the ultimate
magnitudes of theſe velocities; ſo that the ultimate
relation of theſe velocities is the relation of the
fluxions of theſe quantities. Conſequently this laſt

from the demonſtrations, which Sir Iſaac

fluxions.</p>
               <p>IN the beginning of this diſcourſe we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
at ſuch a deſcription of fluxions, as might
not fail of giving a diſtinct and clear conception of
them. We then confirmed the fundamental rules
for comparing fluxions together by demonſtrations
of the moſt formal and unexceptionable kind. And
now having juſtified Sir Iſaac Newton's own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
we have not only ſhewn, that his
doctrine of fluxions is an unerring guide in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of geometrical problems, but alſo that he
himſelf had fully proved the certainty of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.
For accompliſhing this laſt part of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
it was neceſſary to explain at large ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
method of reaſoning eſtabliſhed by him, no
leſs worthy conſideration; ſince as the firſt inabled
him to inveſtigate the geometrical problems, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he was conducted in thoſe remote ſearches into
nature, which have been the ſubject of univerſal
admiration, ſo to the latter method is owing the
ſurprizing brevity, wherewith he has demonſtrated
thoſe diſcoveries.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THUS we have at length finiſhed the
whole of our deſign, and ſhall therefore put
a period to this diſcourſe with the explanation of
the term momentum frequently uſed by Sir Iſaac
Newton, though we have yet had no occaſion to
mention it.</p>
               <p>AND in this I ſhall be the more particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Sir Iſaac Newton's definition of momenta,
That they are the momentaneous increments or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of varying quantities, may poſſibly be
thought obſcure. Therefore I ſhall give a fuller
delineation of them, and ſuch a one, as ſhall agree
to the general ſenſe of his deſcription, and never
fail to make the uſe of this term, in every propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
where it occurs, clearly to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>IN determining the ultimate ratios between the
contemporaneous differences of quantities, it is often
previouſly required to conſider each of theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
apart, in order to diſcover, how much of
thoſe differences is neceſſary for expreſſing that
ultimate ratio. In this caſe Sir Iſaac Newton di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes,
by the name of momentum, ſo much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0218900500:79"/>
of any difference, as conſtitutes the term uſed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
this ultimate ratio.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>IN like manner, if A and B denote varying
quantities, and their contemporaneous increments
be repreſented by <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi>; the rectangle under any
given line M and <hi>a</hi> is the contemporaneous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of the rectangle under M and A, and
A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b</hi> is the like increment of the
rectangle under A, B. And here the whole incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
M × <hi>a</hi> repreſents the momentum of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctangle
under M, A; but A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> only, and
not the whole increment A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b,</hi> is
called the momentum of the rectangle under A, B;
becauſe ſo much only of this latter increment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for determining the ultimate ratio of the
increment of M × A to the increment of A × B, this
ratio being the ſame with the ultimate ratio of
M × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi>; for the ultimate ratio of
A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b</hi> is the ratio
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0218900500:80"/>
of equality. Conſequently the ultimate ratio of
M × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> differs not from the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratio of M × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE momenta equally relate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of quantities, as to their increments,
and the ultimate ratio of increments, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
at the ſame place is the ſame; therefore
the momentum of any quantity may be determined,
either by conſidering the increment, or the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that quantity, or even by conſidering both
together. And in determining the momentum of
the rectangle under A and B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir Iſaac Newton has
taken the laſt of theſe methods; becauſe by this
means the ſuperfluous rectangle is ſooner diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the demonſtration.</p>
               <p>HERE it muſt always be remembred, that the
only uſe, which ought ever to be made of theſe
momenta, is to compare them one with another,
and for no other purpoſe than to determine the
ultimate or prime proportion between the ſeveral
increments or decrements, from whence they are
deduced <note n="*" place="bottom">Neque ſpect.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

ratios eſſentially differs from that of indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
for in that method theſe momenta are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
abſolutely as parts, whereof their reſpective
quantities are actually compoſed. But though theſe
momenta have no final magnitude, which would
be neceſſary to make them parts capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding

a whole by accumulation; yet their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratios are as truly aſſignable as the ratios be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
any quantities whatever. Therefore none
of the objections made againſt the doctrine of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibles
are of the leaſt weight againſt this method:
but while we attend carefully to the obſervation
here laid down, we ſhall be as ſecure againſt error,
and the mind will receive as full ſatisfaction, as in
any the moſt unexceptionable demonſtration of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall make no apology for the length of
this diſcourſe: for as we can ſcarce ſuſpect, after
what has been above written, that our readers will
be at any loſs to remove of themſelves, whatever
little difficulties may have ariſen in this ſubject from
the brevity of Sir Iſaac Newton's expreſſions; ſo
our time cannot be thought miſemployed, if we
ſhall at all have contributed, by a more diffuſive
phraſe, to the eaſier underſtanding theſe exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and celebrated inventions.</p>
