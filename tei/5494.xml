                  <l>Come let us go kick up a bit of a riot;</l>
                  <l>I am hungry, my lads, but I've little to eat,</l>
                  <l>So we'll pull down the mills, and ſeize all the meat:</l>

                  <l>Derry down.</l>
               </lg>
            </sp>
            <lg>
               <l>Then his pitchfork Tom ſeiz'd—hold a moment ſays Jack,</l>
               <l>I'll ſhew thee thy blunder, brave boy, in a crack.</l>
               <l>And if I don't prove we had better be ſtill,</l>
               <l>I'll aſſiſt thee ſtraitway to pull down every mill;</l>
               <l>I'll ſhew thee how paſſion thy reaſon does cheat,</l>
               <l>Or I'll join thee in plunder for bread and for meat.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>What a whimſey to think thus our bellies to fill,</l>
               <l>For we ſtop all the grinding by breaking the mill?</l>
               <l>What a whimſey to think we ſhall get more to eat</l>
               <l>By abuſing the butchers who get us the meat!</l>
               <l>What a whimſey to think we ſhall mend our ſpare diet</l>
               <l>By breeding diſturbance, by murder and riot!</l>
               <l>Derry down.</l>

               <l>Becauſe I am dry, 'twould be fooliſh, I think</l>
               <l>To pull out my tap and to ſpill all my drink;</l>
               <l>Becauſe I am hungry and want to be fed.</l>
               <l>That is ſure no wiſe reaſon for waſting my bread;</l>
               <l>And juſt ſuch wiſe reaſons for mending their diet</l>
               <l>Are us'd by thoſe blockheads who ruſh into riot.</l>

               <l>I would not take comfort from others diſtreſſes,</l>
               <l>But ſtill I would mark how God our land bleſſes;</l>
               <l>For tho' in Old England the times are but ſad,</l>
               <l>Abroad I am told they are ten times as bad;</l>
               <l>In the land of the Pope there is ſcarce any grain,</l>
               <l>And 'tis ſtill worſe, they ſay, both in Holland and Spain.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let us look to the harveſt our wants to beguile,</l>
               <l>See the lands with rich crops how they every where ſmile!</l>
               <l>Mean time to aſſiſt us, by each Weſtern breeze,</l>
               <l>Some corn is brought daily acroſs the ſalt ſeas,</l>
               <l>We'll drink little tea, no whiſky at all,</l>
               <l>But patiently wait, and the prices will fall.</l>

               <l>But, if we're not quiet, then let us not wonder</l>
               <l>If things grow much worſe by our riot and plunder;</l>
               <l>And let us remember, whenever we meet,</l>
               <l>The more ale we drink, boys, the leſs we ſhall eat.</l>
               <l>On thoſe days ſpent in riot, <hi>no</hi> bread you brought home,</l>
               <l>Had you ſpent them in labour you muſt have had <hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A dinner of herbs, ſays the wiſe man, with quiet</l>
               <l>Is better than beef amid diſcord and riot.</l>
               <l>If the thing can't be help'd, I'm a foe to all ſtrife,</l>
               <l>And pray for a peace every night of my life;</l>
               <l>But in matters of ſtate not an inch will I budge,</l>

               <l>Let the King and the Parliament manage the reſt;</l>
               <l>I lament both the War and the Taxes together,</l>
               <l>Tho' I verily think they don't alter the weather.</l>
               <l>The King, as I take it with very good reaſon,</l>
               <l>May prevent a bad law, but can't help a bad ſeaſon.</l>
               <l>Derry down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Parliament-men, altho' great is their power,</l>
               <l>Yet they cannot contrive us a bit of a ſhower;</l>
               <l>And I never yet heard, tho' our Rulers are wiſe;</l>
               <l>That they know very well how to manage the ſkies;</l>
               <l>For the beſt of them all, as they found to their coſt,</l>
               <l>Were not able to hinder laſt Winter's hard froſt.</l>
               <l>Derry down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Beſides, I muſt ſhare in the wants of the times,</l>
               <l>Becauſe I have had my full ſhare in it's crimes;</l>
               <l>And I'm apt to believe the diſtreſs which is ſent,</l>
               <l>Is to puniſh and cure us of all diſcontent.</l>
               <l>—But harveſt is coming—Potatoes will come!</l>
               <l>Our proſpect clears up; Ye complainers be dumb!</l>
               <l>Derry down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And tho' I've no money, and tho' I've no lands,</l>
               <l>I've a head on my ſhoulders, and a pair of good hands;</l>
               <l>So I'll work the whole day, and on Sundays I'll ſeek</l>
               <l>At church how to bear all the wants of the week.</l>
               <l>The Gentlefolks too will afford us ſupplies;</l>
               <l>They'll ſubſcribe—and they'll give up their puddings and pies.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Then before I'm induced to take part in a Riot,</l>
               <l>I'll aſk this ſhort queſtion—What ſhall I get by it?</l>
               <l>So I'll e'en wait a little till cheaper the bread,</l>
               <l>For a mittimus hangs o'er each Rieters head;</l>
               <l>And when of two evils I'm aſk'd which is beſt,</l>
               <l>I'd rather be hungry than be hang'd, I proteſt.</l>
               <l>Derry down.</l>

               <l>Quoth Tom, thou art right: If I riſe, I'm a Turk,</l>
               <l>So he threw down his pitchfork, and went to his work.</l>
