                  <l>Do'st thou not feele me, Rome? Not yet? Is night </l>
                  <l>So heauy on thee, and my weight so light? </l>
                  <l>Can Sylla's Ghost arise within thy walles, </l>
                  <l>Lesse threatning, then an earth-quake, the quicke falles </l>
                  <l>Of thee, and thine? shake not the frighted heads </l>
                  <l>Of thy steepe towers? or shrinke to their first beds? </l>
                  <l>Or, as their ruine the large Tyber fils, </l>
                  <l>Make that swell up, and drowne thy seuen proud hils? </l>
                  <l>What sleape is this doth seize thee, so like death, </l>
                  <l>And is not it? Wake, feele her, in my breath. </l>
                  <l>Behold, I come, sent from the Stygian Sound, </l>
                  <l>As a dire Vapor, that had cleft the ground, </l>
                  <l>To ingender with the night, and blast the day; </l>
                  <l>Or like a Pestilence, that should display </l>
                  <l>Infection through the world: which, thus, I do. </l>
                  <l>Pluto be at thy councels; and into </l>
                  <l>Thy darker bosome enter Sylla's spirit: </l>
                  <l>All, that was mine, and bad, thy brest inherit. </l>
                  <l>Alas, how weake is that, for Catiline! </l>
                  <l>Did I but say (vaine voice) all that was mine? </l>
                  <l>All, that the Gracchi, Cinna, Marius would; </l>
                  <l>What now, had I a body againe, I could, </l>
                  <l>Comming from hell; what Fiendes would wish should be; </l>
                  <l>And Hannibal could not have wish'd to see: </l>
                  <l>Think thou, and practise. Let the long-hid seedes </l>
                  <l>Of treason, in thee, now shoote forth in deedes, </l>
                  <l>Ranker then horror; and thy former facts </l>
                  <l>Not all in mention, but to vrge new acts: </l>
                  <l>Conscience of them prouoke thee on to more. </l>
                  <l>Be still thy Incests, Murders, Rapes before </l>
                  <l>Thy sense; thy forcing first a Vestall Nunne; </l>
                  <l>Thy parricide, late, on thine owne naturall Sonne, </l>
                  <l>After his Mother, to make empty way </l>
                  <l>For thy last wicked Nuptials; worse, then they, </l>
                  <l>That fame that act of thy incestuous life, </l>
                  <l>Which got thee, at once, a Daughter, and a Wife. </l>
                  <l>I leaue the slaughters, that thou didst for me, </l>
                  <l>Of Senators; for which, I hid for thee </l>
                  <l>Thy murder of thy Brother, (being so brib'd) </l>
                  <l>And writ him in the list of my proscrib'd </l>
                  <l>After thy fact, to saue thy little shame: </l>
                  <l>Thy incest, with thy Sister, I not name. </l>
                  <l>These are too light. Fate will have thee pursue </l>
                  <l>Deedes, after which no Mischiefe can be new; </l>
                  <l>The ruine of thy Countrey: Thou wert built </l>
                  <l>For such a worke, and borne for no lesse guilt: </l>
                  <l>What though defeated once thou hast beene, and knowne, </l>
                  <l>Tempt it againe; That is thy act, or none. </l>
                  <l>What all the seuerall Ills, that visite earth, </l>
                  <l>(Brought forth by night, with a sinister birth) </l>
                  <l>Plagues, Famine, Fire could not reach vnto, </l>
                  <l>The Sword, nor Surfets; let thy fury do: </l>
                  <l>Make all past, present, future ill thine owne; </l>
                  <l>And conquer all example, in thy one. </l>
                  <l>Nor let thy thought finde any vacant time </l>
                  <l>To hate an old, but still a fresher crime </l>
                  <l>Drowne the remembrance; Let not mischiefe cease, </l>
                  <l>But, while it is in punishing, encrease. </l>
                  <l>Conscience, and care die in thee; And be free </l>
                  <l>Not Heau'n it selfe from thy impiety: </l>
                  <l>Let Night grow blacker with thy plots; and Day, </l>
                  <l>At shewing but thy head forth, start away </l>
                  <l>From this halfe Spheare: and leaue Romes blinded walls </l>
                  <l>To embrace lusts, hatreds, slaughters, funerals, </l>
                  <l>And not recouer sight, till their owne flames </l>
                  <l>Do light them to their ruines. All the names </l>
                  <l>Of thy Confederates, too, be no less great </l>
                  <l>In hell, then here; That, when we would repeate </l>
                  <l>Our strengths in Muster, we may name you all, </l>
                  <l>And Furies, upon you, for Furies, call. </l>
                  <l>Whilst, what you do, doth strike them into feares, </l>
                  <l>Or make them grieue, and with your mischiefe theirs. </l>

                  <l>Whom I have heau'd, with magnifying his bloud, </l>
                  <l>And a vaine dreame, out of the Sybill's bookes, </l>
                  <l>That a third man of that great family </l>
                  <l>Whereof he is descended, the Cornelij, </l>
                  <l>Should be a King in Rome: which I have hir'd </l>
                  <l>The flatt'ring Augures to interpret him, </l>
                  <l>Cinna, and Sylla dead. Then, bold Cethegus, </l>
                  <l>Whose valour I have turn'd into his poyson, </l>
                  <l>And prais'd so into daring, as he would </l>

                  <l>The engine from the Cyclop's, and give fire </l>

                  <l>For contumelies receiu'd, (and such are sure ones) </l>
                  <l>As Curius, and the fore-nam'd Lentulus, </l>
                  <l>Both which have beene degraded, in the Senate, </l>
                  <l>And must have their disgraces, still, new rub'd, </l>
                  <l>To make them smart, and labour of reuenge. </l>
                  <l>Others, whom meete ambition fires, and dole </l>

                  <l>These, Lecca Vargunteius, Bestia, Autronius, </l>
                  <l>Some, whom their wants oppresse, as the idle Captaines </l>
                  <l>Of Sylla's troopes; and diuers Roman Knights </l>
                  <l>(The profuse wasters of their patrimonies) </l>

                  <l>These, for a time, we must relieue, Aurelia, </l>

                  <l>For any act past, or to come. Such will </l>
                  <l>From their owne crimes, be factious, as from ours. </l>
                  <l>Some more there be slight Ayrelings, will be wonne, </l>
                  <l>With dogs, and horses; or, perhaps, a whore; </l>
                  <l>Which must be had: And, if they venter liues, </l>
                  <l>For us, Aurelia, we must hazard honors </l>
                  <l>A little. Get thee store, and change of women, </l>

                  <l>As, if she threatned Heau'n with warres; </l>
                  <l>And seekes for Hell, in quarries deepe, </l>
                  <l>Giuing the fiends, that there do keepe, </l>

                  <l>Chang'd for the treasure of a shell; </l>

                  <l>More light then sailes, when all windes play: </l>
                  <l>Yet, are the men more loose then they, </l>

                  <l>More sleek'd, more soft, and slacker limm'd; </l>

                  <l>At yuorie tables; or, wood sold </l>
                  <l>Dearer then it: and, leauing plate, </l>
                  <l>Do drinke in stone of higher rate. </l>
                  <l>They hunt all grounds; and draw all seas; </l>
                  <l>Foule euery brooke, and bush; to please </l>
                  <l>Their wanton tasts: and, in request </l>
                  <l>Have new, and rare things; not the best. </l>
                  <l>Hence comes that wild, a vast expence, </l>
                  <l>That hath enforc'd Romes vertue, thence, </l>

                  <l>Her state, with eating auarice, </l>
                  <l>Riot, and euery other vice. </l>
                  <l>Decrees are bought, and Lawes are sold, </l>
                  <l>Honors, and Offices for gold; </l>

                  <l>In as neate gloues. But she is faine of late </l>
                  <l>To seeke, more then she is sought to (the fame is) </l>
                  <l>And so spends that way. </l>

                  <l>She cannot put them on. She knowes not, how </l>
                  <l>To weare a garment. You shall have her all </l>
                  <l>Iewels, and gold sometimes, so that her selfe </l>
                  <l>Appeares the least part of her selfe. No in troth, </l>
                  <l>As I liue, Madame, you put them all downe </l>
                  <l>With your meere strength of iudgement; and do draw, too, </l>

                  <l>Whom thou didst call together, what your plots were? </l>
                  <l>O Age, and Manners! This the Consul sees, </l>
                  <l>The Senate vnderstands, yet this man lives! </l>
                  <l>Liues? Aye, and comes here into Councell with us; </l>
                  <l>Partakes the publique cares: and with his eye </l>
                  <l>Markes, and points out each man of us to slaughter. </l>
                  <l>And we, good men, do satisfie the State, </l>
                  <l>If we can shunne but this mans sword, and madnesse. </l>
                  <l>There was that vertue, once, in Rome, when good men </l>
                  <l>Would, with more sharpe coercion, have restrain'd </l>
                  <l>A wicked Citizen, then the deadliest Foe. </l>
                  <l>We have that law still, Catiline, for thee; </l>
                  <l>An act as graue, as sharpe: The State is not wanting, </l>
                  <l>Nor the authority of this Senate; we, </l>
                  <l>We, that are Consuls, onely fayle our selues. </l>
                  <l>This twentie daies, the edge of that decree </l>
                  <l>We have let dull, a rust; kept it shut up, </l>
                  <l>As in a sheath, which drawne should take thy head. </l>
                  <l>Yet still thou liu'st; and liu'st not to lay by </l>
                  <l>Thy wicked confidence, but to confirme it. </l>
                  <l>I could desire, Fathers, to be found </l>
                  <l>Still mercifull, to seeme in these maine perils, </l>
                  <l>Grasping the state, a man remisse, and slacke; </l>
                  <l>But then, I should condemne my self of sloth, </l>
                  <l>And treachery. Their Campe is in Italy, </l>
                  <l>Pitch'd in the iawes, here, of Hetruria; </l>

                  <l>If, Catiline, I should command thee, now, </l>
                  <l>Here, to be taken, kill'd; I make iust doubt, </l>
                  <l>Whether all good men would not think it done </l>

                  <l>So lost, so wicked, nay so like thy selfe, </l>

                  <l>From working least commotion to the State. </l>
                  <l>I have those eyes, and eares, shall still keepe guard, </l>
                  <l>And spiall on thee, as they have euer done, </l>
                  <l>And thou not feele it. What, then, canst thou hope? </l>
                  <l>If neither Night can, with her darknesse; hide </l>
                  <l>Thy wicked meetings; nor a priuate House </l>
                  <l>Can, in her walles, containe the guiltie whispers </l>
                  <l>Of thy conspiracy: If all breake out, </l>
                  <l>All be discouered, change thy minde at last, </l>
                  <l>And loose thy thoughts of ruine, flame, and slaughter. </l>
                  <l>Remember, how I told, here, to the Senate, </l>
                  <l>That such a day, thy Lictor, Caius Manlius, </l>
                  <l>Would be in armes. Was I deceiued, Catiline, </l>
                  <l>Or in the fact, or in the time? the hower? </l>
                  <l>I told too, in this Senate, that thy purpose </l>
                  <l>Was, on the fifth, the Kalends of Nouember, </l>
                  <l>To have slaughterd this whole Order: which my caution </l>
                  <l>Made many leaue the Citie. Canst thou here </l>
                  <l>Denie, but this thy blacke designe was hindred, </l>
                  <l>That very day, by me, thy selfe clos'd in </l>
                  <l>Within my strengths, so that thou could'st not moue </l>
                  <l>Against a publique reed? when thou wert heard </l>
                  <l>To say, upon the parting of the rest, </l>
                  <l>Thou would'st content thee, with the murder of us, </l>
                  <l>That did remaine. Had'st thou not hope, beside, </l>
                  <l>By a surprize, by night, to take Præneste? </l>
                  <l>Where when thou canst, didst thou not finde the place </l>
                  <l>Made good against thee, with my aides, my watches? </l>
                  <l>My Garrisons fortified it. Thou dost nothing, Sergius, </l>
                  <l>Thou canst endeuour nothing, nay not think, </l>
                  <l>But I both see, and heare it; and am with thee, </l>
                  <l>By, and before, about, and in thee, too. </l>
                  <l>Call but to minde thy last nights businesse. Come, </l>
                  <l>I will vse no circumstance: at Lecca's house, </l>
                  <l>The shop, and mint of your conspiracie, </l>
                  <l>Among your Sword-men, where so many associates </l>
                  <l>Both of thy mischiefe, and thy madnesse, met. </l>

                  <l>Speake, and this shall conuince thee: Here they are, </l>
                  <l>I see them, in this Senate, that were with thee. </l>

                  <l>What Common-wealth, or State is this we have? </l>

                  <l>Follow the Sunne, and find not their ambition. </l>
                  <l>These I behold, being Consull; Nay, I aske </l>

                  <l>Whom it were fit the axe should hew in pieces, </l>
                  <l>I not so much as wound, yet, with my voyce. </l>

                  <l>Two vndertooke this morning, before day, </l>

                  <l>Were not the seates made bare, upon thy entrance? </l>
                  <l>Riss' not the Consular men? and left their places, </l>

                  <l>How dost thou beare this? Surely, if my Slaues </l>

                  <l>That, here, thy fellow Citizens do thee, </l>

                  <l>Why do'st thou looke? They all consent vnto it. </l>
                  <l>Do'st thou expect the authority of their voyces, </l>
                  <l>Whose silent willes condemne thee? While they sit, </l>
                  <l>They approue it; while they suffer it, they decree it; </l>
                  <l>And while they are silent to it, they proclaime it. </l>
                  <l>Proue thou there honest, I will endure the enuie. </l>

                  <l>Terror from danger, or discourse from fury. </l>
                  <l>Goe; I intreat thee: yet, why do I so? </l>
                  <l>When I already know, they are sent afore, </l>
                  <l>That tarry for thee in armes, and do expect thee </l>
                  <l>On the Aurelian way. I know the day </l>
                  <l>Set downe, twixt thee, and Manlius; vnto whom </l>
                  <l>The siluer Eagle too is sent, before: </l>

                  <l>But, may this wise, and sacred Senate say, </l>
                  <l>What mean'st thou Marcus Tullius? If thou know'st </l>

                  <l>Of an intestine warre; that he is the Author </l>
                  <l>Of such a wickednesse; the Caller out </l>
                  <l>Of men of marke in mischiefe, to an action </l>
                  <l>Of so much horror; Prince of such a treason; </l>
                  <l>Why do'st thou send him forth? why let him scape? </l>
                  <l>This is to give him liberty, and power: </l>
                  <l>Rather, thou should'st lay hold upon him, send him </l>
                  <l>To deseru'd death, and a iust punishment. </l>
                  <l>To these so holy voyces, thus I answere. </l>
                  <l>If I did think it timely, Conscript Fathers, </l>

                  <l>But when there are in this graue Order, some, </l>
                  <l>Who, with soft censures, still do nource his hopes; </l>
                  <l>Some, that with not beleeuing, have confirm'd </l>
                  <l>His designes more, and whose authoritie </l>
                  <l>The weaker, as the worst men, too, have follow'd: </l>
                  <l>I would now send him, where they all should see </l>
                  <l>Cleare, as the light, his heart shine; where no man </l>
                  <l>Could be so wickedly, or fondly stupide, </l>
                  <l>But should cry out he saw, touch'd, felt, and grasp't it. </l>
                  <l>Then, when he hath runne out himselfe; led forth </l>
                  <l>His desp'rate partie with him; blowne together </l>
                  <l>Aids of all kinds, both shipwrack'd minds and fortunes: </l>
                  <l>Not onely the growne euill, that now is sprung, </l>
                  <l>And sprouted forth, would be pluck'd up, and weeded; </l>
                  <l>But the stocke, roote, and seed of all the mischiefes, </l>
                  <l>Choking the Common-wealth. Where, should we take </l>

                  <l>Our cares, and feares might seeme a while relieu'd, </l>

                  <l>Deepe, in the veines, and bowels of the State. </l>
                  <l>As humane bodies, laboring with feuers, </l>

                  <l>From either hate, or loue, anger, or pitty: </l>
                  <l>For, where the least of these do hinder, there </l>
                  <l>The minde not easily discernes the truth. </l>
                  <l>I speake this to you, in the name of Rome, </l>
                  <l>For whom you stand; and to the present cause: </l>
                  <l>That this foule fact of Lentulus, and the rest, </l>
                  <l>Weigh not more with you, then your dignity; </l>
                  <l>And you be more indulgent to your passion, </l>
                  <l>Then to your honor. If there could be found </l>
                  <l>A paine, or punishment, equall to their crimes, </l>
                  <l>I would deuise, and helpe: But if the greatnesse </l>
                  <l>Of what they have done, exceede all mans inuention, </l>
                  <l>I think it fit, to stay, where our lawes do. </l>
                  <l>Poore petty States may alter, upon humor, </l>
                  <l>Where, if they offend with anger, few do know it, </l>
                  <l>Because they are obscure; their Fame, and Fortune </l>
                  <l>Is equall, and the same: But they, that are </l>
                  <l>Head of the world, and liue in that seene height, </l>
                  <l>All Mankinde knowes their actions. So we see </l>
                  <l>The greater fortune hath the lesser licence. </l>
                  <l>They must nor sauor, hate, and least be angry: </l>
                  <l>For what with others is call'd anger, there, </l>
                  <l>Is cruelty, and pride. I know Syllanus, </l>
                  <l>Who spoke before me, an iust, valiant Man, </l>
                  <l>A louer of the State, and one that would not, </l>
                  <l>In such a businesse, vse or grace, or hatred; </l>
                  <l>I know, too, well his manners, and his modesty: </l>
                  <l>Nor do I think his sentence cruell (for </l>
                  <l>'Gainst such delinquents, what can be too bloody?) </l>
                  <l>But that it is is abhorring from our state; </l>
                  <l>Since to a Citizen of Rome, offending, </l>
                  <l>Our Lawes give exile, and not death. Why then </l>
                  <l>Decrees he that? It were vaine to think, for feare; </l>
                  <l>When, by the diligence of so worthy a Consul, </l>
                  <l>All is made safe, and certaine. Is it for punishment? </l>
                  <l>Why Death is the end of euils, and a rest, </l>
                  <l>Rather then torment: It dissolues all griefes. </l>
                  <l>And beyond that, is neither care, nor ioy, </l>
                  <l>You heare, my sentence would not have them die. </l>
                  <l>How then? set free, and increase Catilines Armie? </l>
                  <l>So will they, being but banish'd. No, graue Fathers, </l>
                  <l>I iudge them, first, to have their states confiscate, </l>
                  <l>Then, that their persons remaine prisoners </l>
                  <l>In the free townes, farre off from Rome, and seuerd': </l>
                  <l>Where they might neither have relation, </l>
                  <l>Hereafter, to the Senate, or the People. </l>
                  <l>Or; if they had, those townes, then to be mulcted, </l>
                  <l>As enemies to the State, that had their guard. </l>

                  <l>Good Caius Cæsar, here, hath very well, </l>
                  <l>And subtilly discours'd of life, and death, </l>
                  <l>As if he thought those things, a prety fable, </l>

                  <l>Fit for such acts, were only in the City, </l>
                  <l>And not throughout all Italie? or that boldnesse </l>
                  <l>Could not do more, where it found least resistance? </l>
                  <l>It is a vaine Counsaile, if he think them dangerous. </l>
                  <l>Which, if he do not, but that he alone </l>

                  <l>Can draw their aides; but vigilance, counsell, action: </l>
                  <l>Which they will be ashamed to forsake, </l>
                  <l>It is sloth they hate, and cowardise. Here you have </l>
                  <l>The Traytors in your houses, yet you stand </l>
                  <l>Fearing what to do with them; Let them loose, </l>
                  <l>And send them hence with armes too; that your Mercy </l>

                  <l>O, but, they, are great men, and have offended </l>

                  <l>The streights, and needes of Catiline being such, </l>
                  <l>As he must fight, with one of the two Armies, </l>
                  <l>That then had neare enclos'd him; It pleas'd Fate, </l>
                  <l>To make us the obiect of his desperate choise, </l>
                  <l>Wherein the danger almost paiz'd the honor: </l>
                  <l>And as he riss', the day grew blacke with him; </l>
                  <l>And Fate descended nearer to the earth, </l>
                  <l>As if she meant to hide the name of things </l>
                  <l>Vnder her wings, and make the world her quarry. </l>
                  <l>At this we rous'd, least one small minutes stay </l>
                  <l>Had left it to be 'enquir'd, what Rome was. </l>
                  <l>And (as we ought) arm'd in the confidence </l>
                  <l>Of our great cause, in forme of battaile, stood, </l>
                  <l>Whilst Catiline came on, not with the face </l>
                  <l>Of any man, but of a publique ruine: </l>
                  <l>His Count'nance was a ciuill warre it selfe. </l>
                  <l>And all his host had standing in their lookes </l>
                  <l>The palenesse of the death, that was to come. </l>
                  <l>Yet cryed they out like Vultures, and vrg'd on, </l>
                  <l>As if they would præcipitate our fates. </l>
                  <l>Nor staid we longer for them; But himselfe </l>
                  <l>Strooke the first stroke: And, with it, fled a life. </l>
                  <l>Which cut, it seem'd a narrow necke of land </l>
                  <l>Had broke betweene two mighty Seas; and either </l>
                  <l>Flow'd into other; for so did the slaughter: </l>
                  <l>And whirl'd about, as when two violent Tides </l>
                  <l>Meete, and not yeeld. The Furies stood, on hilles </l>
                  <l>Circling the place, and trembled to see men </l>
                  <l>Do more, then they: whilst Piety left the field, </l>
                  <l>Grieu'd for that side, that, in so bad a cause, </l>
                  <l>They knew not, what a crime their valour was. </l>
                  <l>The Sunne stood still, and was, behinde the cloud </l>
                  <l>The battaile made, seene sweating, to driue up </l>
                  <l>His frighted Horse, whom still the noise droue backward. </l>
                  <l>And now had fierce Enyo, like a flame, </l>
                  <l>Consum'd all it could reach, and then it selfe; </l>
                  <l>Had not the Fortune of the Common-wealth </l>
                  <l>Come Pallas-like, to euery Roman thought. </l>
                  <l>Which, Catiline seeing, and that now his Troopes </l>
                  <l>Couer'd that earth, they had fought on, with their trunkes. </l>
                  <l>Ambitious of great fame, to crowne his ill, </l>
                  <l>Collected all his fury, and ranne in </l>
                  <l>(Arm'd with a glory, high as his despaire) </l>
                  <l>Into our battaile, like a Lybian Lion, </l>
                  <l>Upon his hunters, scornefull of our weapons, </l>
                  <l>Carelesse of wounds, plucking downe liues about him, </l>
                  <l>Till he had circled in himselfe with death: </l>
                  <l>Then fell he too, to embrace it where it lay. </l>
                  <l>And as, in that rebellion 'gainst the Gods, </l>
                  <l>Minerua holding forth Medusa's head, </l>
                  <l>One of the Gyant Brethren felt himselfe </l>
                  <l>Grow marble at the killing sight, and now, </l>
                  <l>Almost made stone, beganne to inquire, what flint, </l>
                  <l>What rocke it was, that crept through all his limmes, </l>
                  <l>And, ere he could think more, was that he fear'd; </l>
                  <l>So Catiline, at the sight of Rome in us, </l>
                  <l>Became his Tombe: yet did his looke retaine </l>
                  <l>Some of his fiercenesse, and his hands still mou'd, </l>
                  <l>As if he labor'd, yet to graspe the State, </l>
                  <l>With those rebellious parts. </l>
