            <p>A narrow grave-yard in the heart of a bustling, indifferent city, seen
from the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of
enlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the mouldy
tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual refreshment
of a dull, moist snow-fall. If, while the air is thickened by this frosty
drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the blessed vernal
season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that no depressing
influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly felt on a certain
12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady who stood looking out
of one of the windows of the best hotel in the ancient city of Boston. She
had stood there for half an hour—stood there, that is, at intervals;
for from time to time she turned back into the room and measured its length
with a restless step. In the chimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted
a small blue flame; and in front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man
who was busily plying a pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into
small equal squares, and he was apparently covering them with pictorial
designs—strange-looking figures. He worked rapidly and attentively,
sometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at arm's-length, and
kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling. The lady brushed past
him in her walk; her much-trimmed skirts were voluminous. She never dropped
her eyes upon his work; she only turned them, occasionally, as she passed,
to a mirror suspended above the toilet-table on the other side of the room.
Here she paused a moment, gave a pinch to her waist with her two hands, or
raised these members—they were very plump and pretty—to the
multifold braids of her hair, with a movement half caressing, half
corrective. An attentive observer might have fancied that during these
periods of desultory self-inspection her face forgot its melancholy; but as
soon as she neared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a
very ill-pleased woman. And indeed, in what met her eyes there was little
to be pleased with. The window-panes were battered by the sleet; the
head-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed to be<pb n="876"/>
 holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces. A
tall iron railing protected them from the street, and on the other side of
the railing an assemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the liquid
snow. Many of them were looking up and down; they appeared to be waiting
for something. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place
where they stood,—such a vehicle as the lady at the window, in spite
of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had never seen
before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors, and decorated
apparently with jangling bells, attached to a species of groove in the
pavement, through which it was dragged, with a great deal of rumbling,
bouncing and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small horses. When it
reached a certain point the people in front of the grave-yard, of whom much
the greater number were women, carrying satchels and parcels, projected
themselves upon it in a compact body—a movement suggesting the
scramble for places in a life-boat at sea—and were engulfed in its
large interior. Then the life-boat—or the life-car, as the lady at
the window of the hotel vaguely designated it—went bumping and
jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the helmsman (the man at the
wheel) guiding its course incongruously from the prow. This phenomenon was
repeated every three minutes, and the supply of eagerly-moving women in
cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles, renewed itself in the most liberal
manner. On the other side of the grave-yard was a row of small red brick
houses, showing a series of homely, domestic-looking backs; at the end
opposite the hotel a tall wooden church-spire, painted white, rose high
into the vagueness of the snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it
for some time; for reasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she
had ever seen. She hated it, she despised it; it threw her into a state of
irritation that was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She had
never known herself to care so much about church-spires.</p>
            <p>She was not pretty; but even when it expressed perplexed irritation her
face was most interesting and agreeable. Neither was she in her first
youth; yet, though slender, with a great deal of extremely well-fashioned
roundness of contour—a suggestion both of maturity and
flexibility—she carried her<pb n="877"/>
 three and thirty years as a light-wristed Hebe might have
carried a brimming wine-cup. Her complexion was fatigued, as the French
say; her mouth was large, her lips too full, her teeth uneven, her chin
rather commonly modeled; she had a thick nose, and when she
smiled—she was constantly smiling—the lines beside it rose too
high, toward her eyes. But these eyes were charming: gray in color,
brilliant, quickly glancing, gently resting, full of intelligence. Her
forehead was very low—it was her only handsome feature; and she had a
great abundance of crisp dark hair, finely frizzled, which was always
braided in a manner that suggested some Southern or Eastern, some remotely
foreign, woman. She had a large collection of ear-rings, and wore them in
alternation; and they seemed to give a point to her Oriental or exotic
aspect. A compliment had once been paid her, which, being repeated to her,
gave her greater pleasure than anything she had ever heard. <q>A pretty
woman?</q> some one had said. <q>Why, her features are very bad.</q> 
               <q>I
don't know about her features,</q> a very discerning observer had answered;
<q>but she carries her head like a pretty woman.</q> You may imagine
whether, after this, she carried her head less becomingly.</p>
            <p>She turned away from the window at last, pressing her hands to her eyes.
<q>It 's too horrible!</q> she exclaimed. <q>I shall go back—I shall
go back!</q> And she flung herself into a chair before the fire.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Wait a little, dear child,</q> said the young man softly, sketching
away at his little scraps of paper.</p>
            <p>The lady put out her foot; it was very small, and there was an immense
rosette on her slipper. She fixed her eyes for a while on this ornament,
and then she looked at the glowing bed of anthracite coal in the grate.
<q>Did you ever see anything so hideous as that fire?</q> she demanded.
<q>Did you ever see anything so—so <hi rend="italic">affreux</hi> as—as
everything?</q> She spoke English with perfect purity; but she brought out
this French epithet in a manner that indicated that she was accustomed to
using French epithets.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I think the fire is very pretty,</q> said the young man, glancing at
it a moment. <q>Those little blue tongues, dancing on top of the crimson
embers, are extremely picturesque. They are like a fire in an alchemist's
laboratory.</q>
               <pb n="878"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are too good-natured, my dear,</q> his companion
declared.</p>
            <p>The young man held out one of his drawings, with his head on one side.
His tongue was gently moving along his under-lip.
<q>Good-natured—yes. Too good-natured—no.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are irritating,</q> said the lady, looking at her slipper.</p>
            <p>He began to retouch his sketch. <q>I think you mean simply that you are
irritated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, for that, yes!</q> said his companion, with a little bitter
laugh. <q>It 's the darkest day of my life—and you know what that
means.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Wait till to-morrow,</q> rejoined the young man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, we have made a great mistake. If there is any doubt about it
to-day, there certainly will be none to-morrow. Ce sera clair, au
moins!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man was silent a few moments, driving his pencil. Then at
last, <q>There are no such things as mistakes,</q> he affirmed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Very true—for those who are not clever enough to perceive them.
Not to recognize one's mistakes—that would be happiness in life,</q>
the lady went on, still looking at her pretty foot.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My dearest sister,</q> said the young man, always intent upon his
drawing, <q>it 's the first time you have told me I am not clever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, by your own theory I can't call it a mistake,</q> answered his
sister, pertinently enough.</p>
            <p>The young man gave a clear, fresh laugh. <q>You, at least, are clever
enough, dearest sister,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was not so when I proposed this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Was it you who proposed it?</q> asked her brother.</p>
            <p>She turned her head and gave him a little stare. <q>Do you desire the
credit of it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If you like, I will take the blame,</q> he said, looking up with a
smile.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes,</q> she rejoined in a moment, <q>you make no difference in these
things. You have no sense of property.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man gave his joyous laugh again. <q>If that means I have no
property, you are right!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't joke about your poverty,</q> said his sister. <q>That is quite
as vulgar as to boast about it.</q>
               <pb n="879"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My poverty! I have just finished a drawing that will
bring me fifty francs!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Voyons,</q> said the lady, putting out her hand.</p>
            <p>He added a touch or two, and then gave her his sketch. She looked at it,
but she went on with her idea of a moment before. <q>If a woman were to ask
you to marry her you would say, `Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!' And
you would marry her and be ridiculously happy. Then at the end of three
months you would say to her, `You know that blissful day when I begged you
to be mine!' </q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man had risen from the table, stretching his arms a little; he
walked to the window. <q>That is a description of a charming nature,</q> he
said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, yes, you have a charming nature; I regard that as our capital. If
I had not been convinced of that I should never have taken the risk of
bringing you to this dreadful country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This comical country, this delightful country!</q> exclaimed the
young man, and he broke into the most animated laughter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Is it those women scrambling into the omnibus?</q> asked his
companion. <q>What do you suppose is the attraction?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I suppose there is a very good-looking man inside,</q> said the young
man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In each of them? They come along in hundreds, and the men in this
country don't seem at all handsome. As for the women—I have never
seen so many at once since I left the convent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The women are very pretty,</q> her brother declared, <q>and the whole
affair is very amusing. I must make a sketch of it.</q> And he came back to
the table quickly, and picked up his utensils—a small
sketching-board, a sheet of paper, and three or four crayons. He took his
place at the window with these things, and stood there glancing out, plying
his pencil with an air of easy skill. While he worked he wore a brilliant
smile. Brilliant is indeed the word at this moment for his strongly-lighted
face. He was eight and twenty years old; he had a short, slight, well-made
figure. Though he bore a noticeable resemblance to his sister, he was a
better favored person: fair-haired, clear-faced, witty-looking, with a
delicate finish of feature and an expression at once urbane and not at all
serious,<pb n="880"/>
 a warm blue eye, an eyebrow finely drawn and excessively
arched—an eyebrow which, if ladies wrote sonnets to those of their
lovers, might have been made the subject of such a piece of verse—and
a light moustache that flourished upwards as if blown that way by the
breath of a constant smile. There was something in his physiognomy at once
benevolent and picturesque. But, as I have hinted, it was not at all
serious. The young man's face was, in this respect, singular; it was not at
all serious, and yet it inspired the liveliest confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Be sure you put in plenty of snow,</q> said his sister.
<q>Bonté divine, what a climate!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall leave the sketch all white, and I shall put in the little
figures in black,</q> the young man answered, laughing. <q>And I shall call
it—what is that line in Keats?—Mid-May's Eldest Child!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't remember,</q> said the lady, <q>that mamma ever told me it
was like this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Mamma never told you anything disagreeable. And it 's not like
this—every day. You will see that to-morrow we shall have a splendid
day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Qu'en savez-vous? To-morrow I shall go away.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Where shall you go?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Anywhere away from here. Back to Silberstadt. I shall write to the
Reigning Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man turned a little and looked at her, with his crayon poised.
<q>My dear Eugenia,</q> he murmured, <q>were you so happy at sea?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia got up; she still held in her hand the drawing her brother had
given her. It was a bold, expressive sketch of a group of miserable people
on the deck of a steamer, clinging together and clutching at each other,
while the vessel lurched downward, at a terrific angle, into the hollow of
a wave. It was extremely clever, and full of a sort of tragi-comical power.
Eugenia dropped her eyes upon it and made a sad grimace. <q>How can you
draw such odious scenes?</q> she asked. <q>I should like to throw it into
the fire!</q> And she tossed the paper away. Her brother watched, quietly,
to see where it went. It fluttered down to the floor, where he let it lie.
She came toward the window, pinching in her waist. <q>Why don't you<pb n="881"/>
 reproach me—abuse me?</q> she asked. <q>I think I should
feel better then. Why don't you tell me that you hate me for bringing you
here?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Because you would not believe it. I adore you, dear sister! I am
delighted to be here, and I am charmed with the prospect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know what had taken possession of me. I had lost my head,</q>
Eugenia went on.</p>
            <p>The young man, on his side, went on plying his pencil. <q>It is
evidently a most curious and interesting country. Here we are, and I mean
to enjoy it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His companion turned away with an impatient step, but presently came
back. <q>High spirits are doubtless an excellent thing,</q> she said;
<q>but you give one too much of them, and I can't see that they have done
you any good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; he tapped his
handsome nose with his pencil. <q>They have made me happy!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That was the least they could do; they have made you nothing else.
You have gone through life thanking fortune for such very small favors that
she has never put herself to any trouble for you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She must have put herself to a little, I think, to present me with so
admirable a sister.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Be serious, Felix. You forget that I am your elder.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>With a sister, then, so elderly!</q> rejoined Felix, laughing. <q>I
hoped we had left seriousness in Europe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I fancy you will find it here. Remember that you are nearly thirty
years old, and that you are nothing but an obscure Bohemian—a
penniless correspondent of an illustrated newspaper.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Obscure as much as you please, but not so much of a Bohemian as you
think. And not at all penniless! I have a hundred pounds in my pocket. I
have an engagement to make fifty sketches, and I mean to paint the
portraits of all our cousins, and of all <hi rend="italic">their</hi> cousins, at a hundred
dollars a head.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are not ambitious,</q> said Eugenia.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You are, dear Baroness,</q> the young man replied.</p>
            <p>The Baroness was silent a moment, looking out at the sleet-darkened
grave-yard and the bumping horse-cars. <q>Yes, I am<pb n="882"/>
 ambitious,</q> she said at last. <q>And my ambition has
brought me to this dreadful place!</q> She glanced about her—the room
had a certain vulgur nudity; the bed and the window were
curtainless—and she gave a little passionate sigh. <q>Poor old
ambition!</q> she exclaimed. Then she flung herself down upon a sofa which
stood near against the wall, and covered her face with her hands.</p>
            <p>Her brother went on with his drawing, rapidly and skillfully; after some
moments he sat down beside her and showed her his sketch. <q>Now, don't you
think that 's pretty good for an obscure Bohemian?</q> he asked. <q>I have
knocked off another fifty francs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia glanced at the little picture as he laid it on her lap. <q>Yes,
it is very clever,</q> she said. And in a moment she added, <q>Do you
suppose our cousins do that?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do what?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Get into those things, and look like that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix meditated awhile. <q>I really can't say. It will be interesting to
discover.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, the rich people can't!</q> said the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Are you very sure they are rich?</q> asked Felix, lightly.</p>
            <p>His sister slowly turned in her place, looking at him. <q>Heavenly
powers!</q> she murmured. <q>You have a way of bringing out things!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It will certainly be much pleasanter if they are rich,</q> Felix
declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you suppose if I had not known they were rich I would ever have
come?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man met his sister's somewhat peremptory eye with his bright,
contented glance. <q>Yes, it certainly will be pleasanter,</q> he
repeated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That is all I expect of them,</q> said the Baroness. <q>I don't count
upon their being clever or friendly—at first—or elegant or
interesting. But I assure you I insist upon their being rich.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix leaned his head upon the back of the sofa and looked awhile at the
oblong patch of sky to which the window served as frame. The snow was
ceasing; it seemed to him that the sky had begun to brighten. <q>I count
upon their being rich,</q> he said at last, <q>and powerful, and clever,
and friendly, and<pb n="883"/>
 elegant, and interesting, and generally delightful! Tu vas
voir.</q> And he bent forward and kissed his sister. <q>Look there!</q> he
went on. <q>As a portent, even while I speak, the sky is turning the color
of gold; the day is going to be splendid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, within five minutes the weather had changed.  The sun broke
out through the snow-clouds and jumped into the Baroness's room.
<q>Bonté divine,</q> exclaimed this lady, <q>what a climate!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We will go out and see the world,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>And after a while they went out. The air had grown warm as well as
brilliant; the sunshine had dried the pavements. They walked about the
streets at hazard, looking at the people and the houses, the shops and the
vehicles, the blazing blue sky and the muddy crossings, the hurrying men
and the slow-strolling maidens, the fresh red bricks and the bright green
trees, the extraordinary mixture of smartness and shabbiness. From one hour
to another the day had grown vernal; even in the bustling streets there was
an odor of earth and blossom. Felix was immensely entertained. He had
called it a comical country, and he went about laughing at everything he
saw. You would have said that American civilization expressed itself to his
sense in a tissue of capital jokes. The jokes were certainly excellent, and
the young man's merriment was joyous and genial. He possessed what is
called the pictorial sense; and this first glimpse of democratic manners
stirred the same sort of attention that he would have given to the
movements of a lively young person with a bright complexion. Such attention
would have been demonstrative and complimentary; and in the present case
Felix might have passed for an undispirited young exile revisiting the
haunts of his childhood. He kept looking at the violent blue of the sky, at
the scintillating air, at the scattered and multiplied patches of
color.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Comme c'est bariolé, eh?</q> he said to his sister in that
foreign tongue which they both appeared to feel a mysterious prompting
occasionally to use.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, it is bariolé indeed,</q> the Baroness answered. <q>I
don't like the coloring; it hurts my eyes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It shows how extremes meet,</q> the young man rejoined. <q>Instead of
coming to the West we seem to have gone to the<pb n="884"/>
 East. The way the sky touches the house-tops is just like
Cairo; and the red and blue sign-boards patched over the face of everything
remind one of Mahometan decorations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The young women are not Mahometan,</q> said his companion. <q>They
can't be said to hide their faces. I never saw anything so bold.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thank Heaven they don't hide their faces!</q> cried Felix. <q>Their
faces are uncommonly pretty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, their faces are often very pretty,</q> said the Baroness, who
was a very clever woman. She was too clever a woman not to be capable of a
great deal of just and fine observation. She clung more closely than usual
to her brother's arm; she was not exhilarated, as he was; she said very
little, but she noted a great many things and made her reflections. She was
a little excited; she felt that she had indeed come to a strange country,
to make her fortune. Superficially, she was conscious of a good deal of
irritation and displeasure; the Baroness was a very delicate and fastidious
person. Of old, more than once, she had gone, for entertainment's sake and
in brilliant company, to a fair in a provincial town. It seemed to her now
that she was at an enormous fair—that the entertainment and the
désagréments were very much the same. She found herself
alternately smiling and shrinking; the show was very curious, but it was
probable, from moment to moment, that one would be jostled. The Baroness
had never seen so many people walking about before; she had never been so
mixed up with people she did not know. But little by little she felt that
this fair was a more serious undertaking. She went with her brother into a
large public garden, which seemed very pretty, but where she was surprised
at seeing no carriages. The afternoon was drawing to a close; the coarse,
vivid grass and the slender tree-boles were gilded by the level
sunbeams—gilded as with gold that was fresh from the mine. It was the
hour at which ladies should come out for an airing and roll past a hedge of
pedestrians, holding their parasols askance. Here, however, Eugenia
observed no indications of this custom, the absence of which was more
anomalous as there was a charming avenue of remarkably graceful, arching
elms in the most convenient contiguity to a large, cheerful street, in
which, evidently, among the more prosperous members of the
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie,</hi>
               <pb n="885"/>
 a great deal of pedestrianism went forward. Our friends passed
out into this well lighted promenade, and Felix noticed a great many more
pretty girls and called his sister's attention to them. This latter
measure, however, was superfluous; for the Baroness had inspected,
narrowly, these charming young ladies.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that,</q>
said Felix.</p>
            <p>The Baroness hoped so, but this is not what she said. <q>They are very
pretty,</q> she said, <q>but they are mere little girls. Where are the
women—the women of thirty?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Of thirty-three, do you mean?</q> her brother was going to ask; for
he understood often both what she said and what she did not say. But he
only exclaimed upon the beauty of the sunset, while the Baroness, who had
come to seek her fortune, reflected that it would certainly be well for her
if the persons against whom she might need to measure herself should all be
mere little girls. The sunset was superb; they stopped to look at it; Felix
declared that he had never seen such a gorgeous mixture of colors. The
Baroness also thought it splendid; and she was perhaps the more easily
pleased from the fact that while she stood there she was conscious of much
admiring observation on the part of various nice-looking people who passed
that way, and to whom a distinguished, strikingly-dressed woman with a
foreign air, exclaiming upon the beauties of nature on a Boston street
corner in the French tongue, could not be an object of indifference.
Eugenia's spirits rose. She surrendered herself to a certain tranquil
gayety. If she had come to seek her fortune, it seemed to her that her
fortune would be easy to find. There was a promise of it in the gorgeous
purity of the western sky; there was an intimation in the mild,
unimpertinent gaze of the passers of a certain natural facility in
things.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You will not go back to Silberstadt, eh?</q> asked Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Not to-morrow,</q> said the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Nor write to the Reigning Prince?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall write to him that they evidently know nothing about him over
here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He will not believe you,</q> said the young man. <q>I advise you to
let him alone.</q>
               <pb n="886"/>
            </p>
            <p>Felix himself continued to be in high good humor. Brought up
among ancient customs and in picturesque cities, he yet found plenty of
local color in the little Puritan metropolis. That evening, after dinner,
he told his sister that he should go forth early on the morrow to look up
their cousins.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You are very impatient,</q> said Eugenia.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What can be more natural,</q> he asked, <q>after seeing all those
pretty girls to-day? If one's cousins are of that pattern, the sooner one
knows them the better.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Perhaps they are not,</q> said Eugenia. <q>We ought to have brought
some letters—to some other people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The other people would not be our kinsfolk.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Possibly they would be none the worse for that,</q> the Baroness
replied.</p>
            <p>Her brother looked at her with his eyebrows lifted. <q>That was not what
you said when you first proposed to me that we should come out here and
fraternize with our relatives. You said that it was the prompting of
natural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you
declared that the <hi rend="italic">voix du sang</hi> should go before everything.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You remember all that?</q> asked the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Vividly! I was greatly moved by it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She was walking up and down the room, as she had done in the morning;
she stopped in her walk and looked at her brother. She apparently was going
to say something, but she checked herself and resumed her walk. Then, in a
few moments, she said something different, which had the effect of an
explanation of the suppression of her earlier thought. <q>You will never be
anything but a child, dear brother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One would suppose that you, madam,</q> answered Felix, laughing,
<q>were a thousand years old.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am—sometimes,</q> said the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I will go, then, and announce to our cousins the arrival of a
personage so extraordinary. They will immediately come and pay you their
respects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia paced the length of the room again, and then she stopped before
her brother, laying her hand upon his arm. <q>They are not to come and see
me,</q> she said. <q>You are not to allow that. That is not the way I shall
meet them first.</q> And in answer to his interrogative glance she went on.
<q>You<pb n="887"/>
 will go and examine, and report. You will come back and tell
me who they are and what they are; their number, gender, their respective
ages—all about them. Be sure you observe everything; be ready to
describe to me the locality, the accessories—how shall I say
it?—the mise en scène. Then, at my own time, at my own hour,
under circumstances of my own choosing, I will go to them. I will present
myself—I will appear before them!</q> said the Baroness, this time
phrasing her idea with a certain frankness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And what message am I to take to them?</q> asked Felix, who had a
lively faith in the justness of his sister's arrangements.</p>
            <p>She looked at him a moment—at his expression of agreeable
veracity; and, with that justness that he admired, she replied, <q>Say what
you please. Tell my story in the way that seems to you
most—natural.</q> And she bent her forehead for him to
kiss.</p>
         </div>

            <pb n="888"/>
            <p>The next day was splendid, as Felix had prophesied; if the winter had
suddenly leaped into spring, the spring had for the moment as quickly
leaped into summer. This was an observation made by a young girl who came
out of a large square house in the country, and strolled about in the
spacious garden which separated it from a muddy road. The flowering shrubs
and the neatly-disposed plants were basking in the abundant light and
warmth; the transparent shade of the great elms—they were magnificent
trees—seemed to thicken by the hour; and the intensely habitual
stillness offered a submissive medium to the sound of a distant
church-bell. The young girl listened to the church-bell; but she was not
dressed for church. She was bare-headed; she wore a white muslin waist,
with an embroidered border, and the skirt of her dress was of colored
muslin. She was a young lady of some two or three and twenty years of age,
and though a young person of her sex walking bare-headed in a garden, of a
Sunday morning in spring-time, can, in the nature of things, never be a
displeasing object, you would not have pronounced this innocent
Sabbath-breaker especially pretty. She was tall and pale, thin and a little
awkward; her hair was fair and perfectly straight; her eyes were dark, and
they had the singularity of seeming at once dull and
restless—differing herein, as you see, fatally from the ideal <q>fine
eyes,</q> which we always imagine to be both brilliant and tranquil. The
doors and windows of the large square house were all wide open, to admit
the purifying sunshine, which lay in generous patches upon the floor of a
wide, high, covered piazza adjusted to two sides of the mansion—a
piazza on which several straw-bottomed rocking-chairs and half a dozen of
those small cylindrical stools in green and blue porcelain, which suggest
an affiliation between the residents and the Eastern trade, were
symmetrically disposed. It was an ancient house—ancient in the sense
of being eighty years old; it was built of wood, painted a clean, clear,
faded gray, and adorned along the front, at intervals, with flat wooden
pilasters, painted white. These pilasters appeared to support a kind of
classic<pb n="889"/>
 pediment, which was decorated in the middle by a large triple
window in a boldly carved frame, and in each of its smaller angles by a
glazed circular aperture. A large white door, furnished with a
highly-polished brass knocker, presented itself to the rural-looking road,
with which it was connected by a spacious pathway, paved with worn and
cracked, but very clean, bricks. Behind it there were meadows and orchards,
a barn and a pond; and facing it, a short distance along the road, on the
opposite side, stood a smaller house, painted white, with external shutters
painted green, a little garden on one hand and an orchard on the other. All
this was shining in the morning air, through which the simple details of
the picture addressed themselves to the eye as distinctly as the items of a
<q>sum</q> in addition.</p>
            <p>A second young lady presently came out of the house, across the piazza,
descended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom I have
spoken. This second young lady was also thin and pale; but she was older
than the other; she was shorter; she had dark, smooth hair. Her eyes,
unlike the other's, were quick and bright; but they were not at all
restless. She wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons, and a long, red,
India scarf, which, on the front of her dress, reached to her feet. In her
hand she carried a little key.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Gertrude,</q> she said, <q>are you very sure you had better not go to
church?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at her a moment, plucked a small sprig from a
lilac-bush, smelled it and threw it away. <q>I am not very sure of
anything!</q> she answered.</p>
            <p>The other young lady looked straight past her, at the distant pond,
which lay shining between the long banks of fir-trees. Then she said in a
very soft voice, <q>This is the key of the dining-room closet. I think you
had better have it, if any one should want anything.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Who is there to want anything?</q> Gertrude demanded. <q>I shall be
all alone in the house.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Some one may come,</q> said her companion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you mean Mr. Brand?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, Gertrude. He may like a piece of cake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't like men that are always eating cake!</q> Gertrude declared,
giving a pull at the lilac-bush.<pb n="890"/>
            </p>
            <p>Her companion glanced at her, and then looked down on the
ground. <q>I think father expected you would come to church,</q> she said.
<q>What shall I say to him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Say I have a bad headache.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Would that be true?</q> asked the elder lady, looking straight at the
pond again.</p>
            <p>
               <q>No, Charlotte,</q> said the younger one simply.</p>
            <p>Charlotte transferred her quiet eyes to her companion's face. <q>I am
afraid you are feeling restless.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am feeling as I always feel,</q> Gertrude replied, in the same
tone.</p>
            <p>Charlotte turned away; but she stood there a moment. Presently she
looked down at the front of her dress. <q>Does n't it seem to you, somehow,
as if my scarf were too long?</q> she asked.</p>
            <p>Gertrude walked half round her, looking at the scarf. <q>I don't think
you wear it right,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>How should I wear it, dear?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know; differently from that. You should draw it differently
over your shoulders, round your elbows; you should look differently
behind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>How should I look?</q> Charlotte inquired.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't think I can tell you,</q> said Gertrude, plucking out the
scarf a little behind. <q>I could do it myself, but I don't think I can
explain it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte, by a movement of her elbows, corrected the laxity that had
come from her companion's touch. <q>Well, some day you must do it for me.
It does n't matter now. Indeed, I don't think it matters,</q> she added,
<q>how one looks behind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should say it mattered more,</q> said Gertrude. <q>Then you don't
know who may be observing you. You are not on your guard. You can't try to
look pretty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte received this declaration with extreme gravity. <q>I don't
think one should ever try to look pretty,</q> she rejoined, earnestly.</p>
            <p>Her companion was silent. Then she said, <q>Well, perhaps it 's not of
much use.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte looked at her a little, and then kissed her. <q>I hope you
will be better when we come back.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear sister, I am very well!</q> said Gertrude.<pb n="891"/>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte went down the large brick walk to the garden gate;
her companion strolled slowly toward the house. At the gate Charlotte met a
young man, who was coming in—a tall, fair young man, wearing a high
hat and a pair of thread gloves. He was handsome, but rather too stout. He
had a pleasant smile. <q>Oh, Mr. Brand!</q> exclaimed the young lady.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I came to see whether your sister was not going to church,</q> said
the young man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She says she is not going; but I am very glad you have come. I think
if you were to talk to her a little</q> . . . . And Charlotte lowered her
voice. <q>It seems as if she were restless.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand smiled down on the young lady from his great height. <q>I
shall be very glad to talk to her. For that I should be willing to absent
myself from almost any occasion of worship, however attractive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I suppose you know,</q> said Charlotte, softly, as if positive
acceptance of this proposition might be dangerous. <q>But I am afraid I
shall be late.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I hope you will have a pleasant sermon,</q> said the young man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, Mr. Gilman is always pleasant,</q> Charlotte answered. And she
went on her way.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand went into the garden, where Gertrude, hearing the gate close
behind him, turned and looked at him. For a moment she watched him coming;
then she turned away. But almost immediately she corrected this movement,
and stood still, facing him. He took off his hat and wiped his forehead as
he approached. Then he put on his hat again and held out his hand. His hat
being removed, you would have perceived that his forehead was very large
and smooth, and his hair abundant but rather colorless. His nose was too
large, and his mouth and eyes were too small; but for all this he was, as I
have said, a young man of striking appearance. The expression of his little
clean-colored blue eyes was irresistibly gentle and serious; he looked, as
the phrase is, as good as gold. The young girl, standing in the garden
path, glanced, as he came up, at his thread gloves.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I hoped you were going to church,</q> he said. <q>I wanted to walk
with you.</q>
               <pb n="892"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am very much obliged to you,</q> Gertrude answered.
<q>I am not going to church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She had shaken hands with him; he held her hand a moment. <q>Have you
any special reason for not going?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, Mr. Brand,</q> said the young girl.</p>
            <p>
               <q>May I ask what it is?</q>
            </p>
            <p>She looked at him smiling; and in her smile, as I have intimated, there
was a certain dullness. But mingled with this dullness was something sweet
and suggestive. <q>Because the sky is so blue!</q> she said.</p>
            <p>He looked at the sky, which was magnificent, and then said, smiling too,
<q>I have heard of young ladies staying at home for bad weather, but never
for good. Your sister, whom I met at the gate, tells me you are
depressed,</q> he added.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Depressed? I am never depressed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, surely, sometimes,</q> replied Mr. Brand, as if he thought this a
regrettable account of one's self.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am never depressed,</q> Gertrude repeated. <q>But I am sometimes
wicked. When I am wicked I am in high spirits. I was wicked just now to my
sister.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What did you do to her?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I said things that puzzled her—on purpose.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why did you do that, Miss Gertrude?</q> asked the young man.</p>
            <p>She began to smile again. <q>Because the sky is so blue!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You say things that puzzle me,</q> Mr. Brand declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I always know when I do it,</q> proceeded Gertrude. <q>But people
puzzle me more, I think. And they don't seem to know!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This is very interesting,</q> Mr. Brand observed, smiling.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You told me to tell you about my—my struggles,</q> the young
girl went on.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us talk about them. I have so many things to say.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude turned away a moment; and then, turning back, <q>You had better
go to church,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You know,</q> the young man urged, <q>that I have always one thing to
say.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at him a moment. <q>Please don't say it
now!</q>
               <pb n="893"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We are all alone,</q> he continued, taking off his hat;
<q>all alone in this beautiful Sunday stillness.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked around her, at the breaking buds, the shining distance,
the blue sky to which she had referred as a pretext for her irregularities.
<q>That 's the reason,</q> she said, <q>why I don't want you to speak. Do
me a favor; go to church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>May I speak when I come back?</q> asked Mr. Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If you are still disposed,</q> she answered.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know whether you are wicked,</q> he said, <q>but you are
certainly puzzling.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She had turned away; she raised her hands to her ears. He looked at her
a moment, and then he slowly walked to church.</p>
            <p>She wandered for a while about the garden, vaguely and without purpose.
The church-bell had stopped ringing; the stillness was complete. This young
lady relished highly, on occasions, the sense of being alone—the
absence of the whole family and the emptiness of the house. To-day,
apparently, the servants had also gone to church; there was never a figure
at the open windows; behind the house there was no stout negress in a red
turban, lowering the bucket into the great shingle-hooded well. And the
front door of the big, unguarded home stood open, with the trustfulness of
the golden age; or what is more to the purpose, with that of New England's
silvery prime. Gertrude slowly passed through it, and went from one of the
empty rooms to the other—large, clear-colored rooms, with white
wainscots, ornamented with thin-legged mahogany furniture, and, on the
walls, with old-fashioned engravings, chiefly of scriptural subjects, hung
very high. This agreeable sense of solitude, of having the house to
herself, of which I have spoken, always excited Gertrude's imagination; she
could not have told you why, and neither can her humble historian. It
always seemed to her that she must do something particular—that she
must honor the occasion; and while she roamed about, wondering what she
could do, the occasion usually came to an end. To-day she wondered more
than ever. At last she took down a book; there was no library in the house,
but there were books in all the rooms. None of them were forbidden books,
and Gertrude<pb n="894"/>
 had not stopped at home for the sake of a chance to climb to
the in accessible shelves. She possessed herself of a very obvious
volume—one of the series of the Arabian Nights—and she brought
it out into the portico and sat down with it in her lap. There, for a
quarter of an hour, she read the history of the loves of the Prince
Camaralzaman and the Princess Badoura. At last, looking up, she beheld, as
it seemed to her, the Prince Camaralzaman standing before her. A beautiful
young man was making her a very low bow—a magnificent bow, such as
she had never seen before. He appeared to have dropped from the clouds; he
was wonderfully handsome; he smiled—smiled as if he were smiling on
purpose. Extreme surprise, for a moment, kept Gertrude sitting still; then
she rose, without even keeping her finger in her book. The young man, with
his hat in his hand, still looked at her, smiling and smiling. It was very
strange.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Will you kindly tell me,</q> said the mysterious visitor, at last,
<q>whether I have the honor of speaking to Miss Went-worth?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My name is Gertrude Wentworth,</q> murmured the young woman.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Then—then—I have the honor—the pleasure—of
being your cousin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man had so much the character of an apparition that this
announcement seemed to complete his unreality. <q>What cousin? Who are
you?</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>He stepped back a few paces and looked up at the house; then glanced
round him at the garden and the distant view. After this he burst out
laughing. <q>I see it must seem to you very strange,</q> he said. There
was, after all, something substantial in his laughter. Gertrude looked at
him from head to foot. Yes, he was remarkably handsome; but his smile was
almost a grimace. <q>It is very still,</q> he went on, coming nearer again.
And as she only looked at him, for reply, he added, <q>Are you all
alone?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Every one has gone to church,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was afraid of that!</q> the young man exclaimed. <q>But I hope you
are not afraid of me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You ought to tell me who you are,</q> Gertrude answered.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am afraid of you!</q> said the young man. <q>I had a different<pb n="895"/>
plan. I expected the servant would take in my card, and that
you would put your heads together, before admitting me, and make out my
identity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude had been wondering with a quick intensity which brought its
result; and the result seemed an answer—a wondrous, delightful
answer—to her vague wish that something would befall her. <q>I
know—I know,</q> she said. <q>You come from Europe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We came two days ago. You have heard of us, then—you believe in
us?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We have known, vaguely,</q> said Gertrude, <q>that we had relations
in France.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And have you ever wanted to see us?</q> asked the young man.</p>
            <p>Gertrude was silent a moment. <q>I have wanted to see you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am glad, then, it is you I have found. We wanted to see you, so we
came.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>On purpose?</q> asked Gertrude.</p>
            <p>The young man looked round him, smiling still. <q>Well, yes; on purpose.
Does that sound as if we should bore you?</q> he added. <q>I don't think we
shall—I really don't think we shall. We are rather fond of wandering,
too; and we were glad of a pretext.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And you have just arrived?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In Boston, two days ago. At the inn I asked for Mr. Wentworth. He
must be your father. They found out for me where he lived; they seemed
often to have heard of him. I determined to come, without ceremony. So,
this lovely morning, they set my face in the right direction, and told me
to walk straight before me, out of town. I came on foot because I wanted to
see the country. I walked and walked, and here I am! It 's a good many
miles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is seven miles and a half,</q> said Gertrude, softly. Now that
this handsome young man was proving himself a reality she found herself
vaguely trembling; she was deeply excited. She had never in her life spoken
to a foreigner, and she had often thought it would be delightful to do so.
Here was one who had suddenly been engendered by the Sabbath stillness for
her private use; and such a brilliant, polite, smiling one! She found time
and means to compose herself, however: to<pb n="896"/>
 remind herself that she must exercise a sort of official
hospitality. <q>We are very—very glad to see you,</q> she said.
<q>Won't you come into the house?</q> And she moved toward the open
door.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You are not afraid of me, then?</q> asked the young man again, with
his light laugh.</p>
            <p>She wondered a moment, and then, <q>We are not afraid—here,</q>
she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, comme vous devez avoir raison!</q> cried the young man, looking
all round him, appreciatively. It was the first time that Gertrude had
heard so many words of French spoken. They gave her something of a
sensation. Her companion followed her, watching, with a certain excitement
of his own, this tall, interesting-looking girl, dressed in her clear,
crisp muslin. He paused in the hall, where there was a broad white
staircase with a white balustrade. <q>What a pleasant house!</q> he said.
<q>It 's lighter inside than it is out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's pleasanter here,</q> said Gertrude, and she led the way into
the parlor,—a high, clean, rather empty-looking room. Here they stood
looking at each other,—the young man smiling more than ever;
Gertrude, very serious, trying to smile.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't believe you know my name,</q> he said. <q>I am called Felix
Young. Your father is my uncle. My mother was his half sister, and older
than he.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes,</q> said Gertrude, <q>and she turned Roman Catholic and married
in Europe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I see you know,</q> said the young man. <q>She married and she died.
Your father's family did n't like her husband. They called him a foreigner;
but he was not. My poor father was born in Sicily, but his parents were
American.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In Sicily?</q> Gertrude murmured.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is true,</q> said Felix Young, <q>that they had spent their lives
in Europe. But they were very patriotic. And so are we.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And you are Sicilian,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Sicilian, no! Let 's see. I was born at a little place—a dear
little place—in France. My sister was born at Vienna.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So  you are French,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Heaven forbid!</q> cried the young man. Gertrude's eyes were fixed
upon him almost insistently. He began to laugh<pb n="897"/>
 again. <q>I can easily be French, if that will please
you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are a foreigner of some sort,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Of some sort—yes; I suppose so. But who can say of what sort? I
don't think we have ever had occasion to settle the question. You know
there are people like that. About their country, their religion, their
profession, they can't tell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude stood there gazing; she had not asked him to sit down. She had
never heard of people like that; she wanted to hear. <q>Where do you
live?</q> she asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They can't tell that, either!</q> said Felix. <q>I am afraid you will
think they are little better than vagabonds. I have lived
anywhere—everywhere. I really think I have lived in every city in
Europe.</q> Gertrude gave a little long soft exhalation. It made the young
man smile at her again; and his smile made her blush a little. To take
refuge from blushing she asked him if, after his long walk, he was not
hungry or thirsty. Her hand was in her pocket; she was fumbling with the
little key that her sister had given her. <q>Ah, my dear young lady,</q> he
said, clasping his hands a little, <q>if you could give me, in charity, a
glass of wine!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude gave a smile and a little nod, and went quickly out of the
room. Presently she came back with a very large decanter in one hand and a
plate in the other, on which was placed a big, round cake with a frosted
top. Gertrude, in taking the cake from the closet, had had a moment of
acute consciousness that it composed the refection of which her sister had
thought that Mr. Brand would like to partake. Her kinsman from across the
seas was looking at the pale, high-hung engravings. When she came in he
turned and smiled at her, as if they had been old friends meeting after a
separation. <q>You wait upon me yourself?</q> he asked. <q>I am served like
the gods!</q> She had waited upon a great many people, but none of them had
ever told her that. The observation added a certain lightness to the step 
with which she went to a little table where there were some curious red
glasses—glasses covered with little gold sprigs, which Charlotte used
to dust every morning with her own hands. Gertrude thought the glasses very
handsome, and it was a pleasure to her to know that the wine was good; it
was her father's famous madeira. Felix <pb n="898"/>
Young thought it excellent; he wondered why he had been told
that there was no wine in America. She cut him an immense triangle out of
the cake, and again she thought of Mr. Brand. Felix sat there, with his
glass in one hand and his huge morsel of cake in the other—eating,
drinking, smiling, talking. <q>I am very hungry,</q> he said. <q>I am not
at all tired; I am never tired. But I am very hungry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You must stay to dinner,</q> said Gertrude. <q>At two o'clock. They
will all have come back from church; you will see the others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Who are the others?</q> asked the young man. <q>Describe them
all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You will see for yourself. It is you that must tell me; now, about
your sister.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My sister is the Baroness Münster,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>On hearing that his sister was a Baroness, Gertrude got up and walked
about slowly, in front of him. She was silent a moment. She was thinking of
it. <q>Why did n't she come, too?</q> she asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She did come; she is in Boston, at the hotel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We will go and see her,</q> said Gertrude, looking at him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She begs you will not!</q> the young man replied. <q>She sends you
her love; she sent me to announce her. She will come and pay her respects
to your father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude felt herself trembling again. A Baroness Münster, who sent
a brilliant young man to <q>announce</q> her; who was coming, as the Queen
of Sheba came to Solomon, to pay her <q>respects</q> to quiet Mr.
Wentworth—such a personage presented herself to Gertrude's vision
with a most effective unexpectedness. For a moment she hardly knew what to
say. <q>When will she come?</q> she asked at last.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As soon as you will allow her—to-morrow. She is very
impatient,</q> answered Felix, who wished to be agreeable.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To-morrow, yes,</q> said Gertrude. She wished to ask more about her;
but she hardly knew what could be predicated of a Baroness Münster.
<q>Is she—is she—married?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix had finished his cake and wine; he got up, fixing upon the young
girl his bright, expressive eyes. <q>She is married to a German
prince—Prince Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. He is not the
reigning prince; he is a younger brother.</q>
               <pb n="899"/>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude gazed at her informant; her lips were slightly
parted. <q>Is she a—a <hi rend="italic">Princess?</hi>
               </q> she asked at last.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, no,</q> said the young man; <q>her position is rather a singular
one. It 's a morganatic marriage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Morganatic?</q> These were new names and new words to poor
Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's what they call a marriage, you know, contracted between a
scion of a ruling house and—and a common mortal. They made Eugenia a
Baroness, poor woman; but that was all they could do. Now they want to
dissolve the marriage. Prince Adolf, between ourselves, is a ninny; but his
brother, who is a clever man, has plans for him. Eugenia, naturally enough,
makes difficulties; not, however, that I think she cares much—she 's
a very clever woman; I 'm sure you 'll like her—but she wants to
bother them. Just now everything is <hi rend="italic">en l'air.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The cheerful, off-hand tone in which her visitor related this darkly
romantic tale seemed to Gertrude very strange; but it seemed also to convey
a certain flattery to herself, a recognition of her wisdom and dignity. She
felt a dozen impressions stirring within her, and presently the one that
was uppermost found words. <q>They want to dissolve her marriage?</q> she
asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So it appears.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And against her will?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Against her right.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She must be very unhappy!</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>Her visitor looked at her, smiling; he raised his hand to the back of
his head and held it there a moment. <q>So she says,</q> he answered.
<q>That 's her story. She told me to tell it you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Tell me more,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>No, I will leave that to her; she does it better.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude gave her little excited sigh again. <q>Well, if she is
unhappy,</q> she said, <q>I am glad she has come to us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She had been so interested that she failed to notice the sound of a
footstep in the portico; and yet it was a footstep that she always
recognized. She heard it in the hall, and then she looked out of the
window. They were all coming back from church—her father, her sister
and brother, and their cousins, who always came to dinner on Sunday. Mr.
Brand<pb n="900"/>
 had come in first; he was in advance of the others, because,
apparently, he was still disposed to say what she had not wished him to say
an hour before. He came into the parlor, looking for Gertrude. He had two
little books in his hand. On seeing Gertrude's companion he slowly stopped,
looking at him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Is this a cousin?</q> asked Felix.</p>
            <p>Then Gertrude saw that she must introduce him; but her ears, and, by
sympathy, her lips, were full of all that he had been telling her. <q>This
is the Prince,</q> she said, <q>the Prince of
Silberstadt-Schreckenstein!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix burst out laughing, and Mr. Brand stood staring, while the others,
who had passed into the house, appeared behind him in the open
door-way.</p>

            <p>That evening at dinner Felix Young gave his sister, the Baroness
Münster, an account of his impressions. She saw that he had come back
in the highest possible spirits; but this fact, to her own mind, was not a
reason for rejoicing. She had but a limited confidence in her brother's
judgment; his capacity for taking rose-colored views was such as to
vulgarize one of the prettiest of tints. Still, she supposed he could be
trusted to give her the mere facts; and she invited him with some eagerness
to communicate them. <q>I suppose, at least, they did n't turn you out from
the door;</q> she said. <q>You have been away some ten hours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Turn me from the door!</q> Felix exclaimed. <q>They took me to their
hearts; they killed the fatted calf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I know what you want to say: they are a collection of angels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Exactly,</q> said Felix. <q>They are a collection of
angels—simply.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>C'est bien vague,</q> remarked the Baroness. <q>What are they
like?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Like nothing you ever saw.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am sure I am much obliged; but that is hardly more definite.
Seriously, they were glad to see you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Enchanted. It has been the proudest day of my life. Never, never have
I been so lionized! I assure you, I was cock of the walk. My dear
sister,</q> said the young man, <q>nous n'avons qu'à nous tenir; we
shall be great swells!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madame Münster looked at him, and her eye exhibited a slight
responsive spark. She touched her lips to a glass of wine, and then she
said, <q>Describe them. Give me a picture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix drained his own glass. <q>Well, it 's in the country, among the
meadows and woods; a wild sort of place, and yet not far from here. Only,
such a road, my dear! Imagine one of the Alpine glaciers reproduced in mud.
But you will not spend much time on it, for they want you to come and stay,
once for all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah,</q> said the Baroness, <q>they want me to come and stay, once for
all? Bon.</q>
               <pb n="902"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's intensely rural, tremendously natural; and all
overhung with this strange white light, this far-away blue sky. There 's a
big wooden house—a kind of three-story bungalow; it looks like a
magnified Nüremberg toy. There was a gentleman there that made a
speech to me about it and called it a `venerable mansion;' but it looks as
if it had been built last night.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Is it handsome—is it elegant?</q> asked the Baroness.</p>
            <p>Felix looked at her a moment, smiling. <q>It 's very clean! No
splendors, no gilding, no troops of servants; rather straight-backed
chairs. But you might eat off the floors, and you can sit down on the
stairs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That must be a privilege. And the inhabitants are straight-backed
too, of course.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear sister,</q> said Felix, <q>the inhabitants are
charming.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In what style?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In a style of their own. How shall I describe it? It 's primitive; it
's patriarchal; it 's the <hi rend="italic">ton</hi> of the golden age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And have they nothing golden but their ton? Are there no symptoms of
wealth?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should say there was wealth without symptoms. A plain, homely way
of life: nothing for show, and very little for—what shall I call
it?—for the senses: but a great <hi rend="italic">aisance,</hi> and a lot of money,
out of sight, that comes forward very quietly for subscriptions to
institutions, for repairing tenements, for paying doctor's bills; perhaps
even for portioning daughters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And the daughters?</q> Madame Münster demanded. <q>How many
are
there?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There are two, Charlotte and Gertrude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Are they pretty?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One of them,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Which is that?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man was silent, looking at his sister. <q>Charlotte,</q> he
said at last.</p>
            <p>She looked at him in return. <q>I see. You are in love with Gertrude.
They must be Puritans to their finger-tips; anything but gay!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No, they are not gay,</q> Felix admitted. <q>They are sober; they are
even severe. They are of a pensive cast; they take things hard. I think
there is something the matter with<pb n="903"/>
 them; they have some melancholy memory or some depressing
expectation. It 's not the epicurean temperament. My uncle, Mr. Wentworth,
is a tremendously high-toned old fellow; he looks as if he were undergoing
martyrdom, not by fire, but by freezing. But we shall cheer them up; we
shall do them good. They will take a good deal of stirring up; but they are
wonderfully kind and gentle. And they are appreciative. They think one
clever; they think one remarkable!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is very fine, so far as it goes,</q> said the Baroness. <q>But
are we to be shut up to these three people, Mr. Wentworth and the two young
women—what did you say their names were—Deborah and
Hephzibah?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, no; there is another little girl, a cousin of theirs, a very
pretty creature; a thorough little American. And then there is the son of
the house.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Good!</q> said the Baroness. <q>We are coming to the gentlemen. What
of the son of the house?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am afraid he gets tipsy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He, then, has the epicurean temperament! How old is he?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He is a boy of twenty; a pretty young fellow, but I am afraid he has
vulgar tastes. And then there is Mr. Brand—a very tall young man, a
sort of lay-priest. They seem to think a good deal of him, but I don't
exactly make him out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And is there nothing,</q> asked the Baroness, <q>between these
extremes—this mysterious ecclesiastic and that intemperate
youth?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, yes, there is Mr. Acton. I think,</q> said the young man, with a
nod at his sister, <q>that you will like Mr. Acton.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Remember that I am very fastidious,</q> said the Baroness. <q>Has he
very good manners?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He will have them with you. He is a man of the world; he has been to
Chin a.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madame Münster gave a little laugh. <q>A man of the Chinese world!
He must be very interesting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have an idea that he brought home a fortune,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That is always interesting. Is he young, good-looking,
clever?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He is less than forty; he has a baldish head; he says witty<pb n="904"/>
 things. I rather think,</q> added the young man, <q>that he
will admire the Baroness Münster.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is very possible,</q> said this lady. Her brother never knew how
she would take things; but shortly afterwards she declared that he had made
a very pretty description and that on the morrow she would go and see for
herself.</p>
            <p>They mounted, accordingly, into a great barouche—a vehicle as to
which the Baroness found nothing to criticise but the price that was asked
for it and the fact that the coachman wore a straw hat. (At Silberstadt
Madame Münster had had liveries of yellow and crimson.) They drove
into the country, and the Baroness, leaning far back and swaying her
lace-fringed parasol, looked to right and to left and surveyed the way-side
objects. After a while she pronounced them <q>affreux.</q> Her brother
remarked that it was apparently a country in which the foreground was
inferior to the <hi rend="italic">plans reculés</hi>: and the Baroness rejoined that
the landscape seemed to be all foreground. Felix had fixed with his new
friends the hour at which he should bring his sister; it was four o'clock
in the afternoon. The large, clean-faced house wore, to his eyes, as the
barouche drove up to it, a very friendly aspect; the high, slender elms
made lengthening shadows in front of it. The Baroness descended; her
American kinsfolk were stationed in the portico. Felix waved his hat to
them, and a tall, lean gentleman, with a high forehead and a clean shaven
face, came forward toward the garden gate. Charlotte Wentworth walked at
his side. Gertrude came behind, more slowly. Both of these young ladies
wore rustling silk dresses. Felix ushered his sister into the gate. <q>Be
very gracious,</q> he said to her. But he saw the admonition was
superfluous. Eugenia was prepared to be gracious as only Eugenia could be.
Felix knew no keener pleasure than to be able to admire his sister
unrestrictedly; for if the opportunity was frequent, it was not inveterate.
When she desired to please she was to him, as to every one else, the most
charming woman in the world. Then he forgot that she was ever anything
else; that she was sometimes hard and perverse; that he was occasionally
afraid of her. Now, as she took his arm to pass into the garden, he felt
that she desired, that she proposed, to please, and this situation made him
very happy. Eugenia would please.<pb n="905"/>
            </p>
            <p>The tall gentleman came to meet her, looking very rigid and
grave. But it was a rigidity that had no illiberal meaning. Mr. Wentworth's
manner was pregnant, on the contrary, with a sense of grand responsibility,
of the solemnity of the occasion, of its being difficult to show sufficient
deference to a lady at once so distinguished and so unhappy. Felix had
observed on the day before his characteristic pallor; and now he perceived
that there was something almost cadaverous in his uncle's high-featured
white face. But so clever were this young man's quick sympathies and
perceptions that he already learned that in these semi-mortuary
manifestations there was no cause for alarm. His light imagination had
gained a glimpse of Mr. Wentworth's spiritual mechanism, and taught him
that, the old man being infinitely conscientious, the special operation of
conscience within him announced itself by several of the indications of
physical faintness.</p>
            <p>The Baroness took her uncle's hand, and stood looking at him with her
ugly face and her beautiful smile. <q>Have I done right to come?</q> she
asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Very right, very right,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, solemnly. He had
arranged in his mind a little speech; but now it quite faded away. He felt
almost frightened. He had never been looked at in just that way—with
just that fixed, intense smile—by any woman; and it perplexed and
weighed upon him, now, that the woman who was smiling so and who had
instantly given him a vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented
attributes, was his own niece, the child of his own father's daughter. The
idea that his niece should be a German Baroness, married
<q>morganatically</q> to a Prince, had already given him much to think
about. Was it right, was it just, was it acceptable? He always slept badly,
and the night before he had lain awake much more even than usual, asking
himself these questions. The strange word <q>morganatic</q> was constantly
in his ears; it reminded him of a certain Mrs. Morgan whom he had once
known and who had been a bold, unpleasant woman. He had a feeling that it
was his duty, so long as the Baroness looked at him, smiling in that way,
to meet her glance with his own scrupulously adjusted, consciously frigid
organs of vision; but on this occasion he failed<pb n="906"/>
 to perform his duty to the last. He looked away toward his
daughters. <q>We are very glad to see you,</q> he had said. <q>Allow me to
introduce my daughters—Miss Charlotte Wentworth, Miss Gertrude
Wentworth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness thought she had never seen people less demonstrative. But
Charlotte kissed her and took her hand, looking at her sweetly and
solemnly. Gertrude seemed to her almost funereal, though Gertrude might
have found a source of gayety in the fact that Felix, with his magnificent
smile, had been talking to her; he had greeted her as a very old friend.
When she kissed the Baroness she had tears in her eyes. Madame Münster
took each of these young women by the hand, and looked at them all over.
Charlotte thought her very strange-looking and singularly dressed; she
could not have said whether it was well or ill. She was glad, at any rate,
that they had put on their silk gowns—especially Gertrude. <q>My
cousins are very pretty,</q> said the Baroness, turning her eyes from one
to the other. <q>Your daughters are very handsome, sir.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte blushed quickly; she had never yet heard her personal
appearance alluded to in a loud, expressive voice. Gertrude looked
away—not at Felix; she was extremely pleased. It was not the
compliment that pleased her; she did not believe it; she thought herself
very plain. She could hardly have told you the source of her satisfaction;
it came from something in the way the Baroness spoke, and it was not
diminished—it was rather deepened, oddly enough—by the young
girl's disbelief. Mr. Wentworth was silent; and then he asked, formally,
<q>Won't you come into the house?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>These are not all; you have some other children,</q> said the
Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have a son,</q> Mr. Wentworth answered.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And why does n't he come to meet me?</q> Eugenia cried. <q>I am
afraid he is not so charming as his sisters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know; I will see about it,</q> the old man declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He is rather afraid of ladies,</q> Charlotte said, softly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He is very handsome,</q> said Gertrude, as loud as she could.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We will go in and find him. We will draw him out of his
<hi rend="italic">cachette</hi>.</q> And the Baroness took Mr. Wentworth's arm, who was not
aware that he had offered it to her, and who, as they <pb n="907"/>
walked toward the house, wondered whether he ought to have
offered it and whether it was proper for her to take it if it had not been
offered. <q>I want to know you well,</q> said the Baroness, interrupting
these meditations, <q>and I want you to know me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It seems natural that we should know each other,</q> Mr. Wentworth
rejoined. <q>We are near relatives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, there comes a moment in life when one reverts, irresistibly, to
one's natural ties—to one's natural affections. You must have found
that!</q> said Eugenia.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth had been told the day before by Felix that Eugenia was
very clever, very brilliant, and the information had held him in some
suspense. This was the cleverness, he supposed; the brilliancy was
beginning. <q>Yes, the natural affections are very strong,</q> he
murmured.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In some people,</q> the Baroness declared. <q>Not in all.</q>
Charlotte was walking beside her; she took hold of her hand again, smiling
always. <q>And you, <hi rend="italic">cousine</hi>, where did you get that enchanting
complexion?</q> she went on; <q>such lilies and roses?</q> The roses in
poor Charlotte's countenance began speedily to predominate over the lilies,
and she quickened her step and reached the portico. <q>This is the country
of complexions,</q> the Baroness continued, addressing herself to Mr.
Wentworth. <q>I am convinced they are more delicate. There are very good
ones in England—in Holland; but they are very apt to be coarse. There
is too much red.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think you will find,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, <q>that this country
is superior in many respects to those you mention. I have been to England
and Holland.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, you have been to Europe?</q> cried the Baroness. <q>Why did n't
you come and see me? But it 's better, after all, this way,</q> she said.
They were entering the house; she paused and looked round her. <q>I see you
have arranged your house—your beautiful house—in the—in
the Dutch taste!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The house is very old,</q> remarked Mr. Wentworth. <q>General
Washington once spent a week here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, I have heard of Washington,</q> cried the Baroness. <q>My father
used to tell me of him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth was silent a moment, and then, <q>I found he was very well
known in Europe,</q> he said.<pb n="908"/>
            </p>
            <p>Felix had lingered in the garden with Gertrude; he was
standing before her and smiling, as he had done the day before. What had
happened the day before seemed to her a kind of dream. He had been there
and he had changed everything; the others had seen him, they had talked
with him; but that he should come again, that he should be part of the
future, part of her small, familiar, much-meditating life—this
needed, afresh, the evidence of her senses. The evidence had come to her
senses now; and her senses seemed to rejoice in it. <q>What do you think of
Eugenia?</q> Felix asked. <q>Is n't she charming?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She is very brilliant,</q> said Gertrude. <q>But I can't tell yet.
She seems to me like a singer singing an air. You can't tell till the song
is done.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, the song will never be done!</q> exclaimed the young man,
laughing. <q>Don't you think her handsome?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude had been disappointed in the beauty of the Baroness
Münster; she had expected her, for mysterious reasons, to resemble a
very pretty portrait of the Empress Josephine, of which there hung an
engraving in one of the parlors, and which the younger Miss Wentworth had
always greatly admired. But the Baroness was not at all like that—not
at all. Though different, however, she was very wonderful, and Gertrude
felt herself most suggestively corrected. It was strange, nevertheless,
that Felix should speak in that positive way about his sister's beauty.
<q>I think I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> think her handsome,</q> Gertrude said. <q>It must
be very interesting to know her. I don't feel as if I ever could.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, you will know her well; you will become great friends,</q> Felix
declared, as if this were the easiest thing in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She is very graceful,</q> said Gertrude, looking after the Baroness,
suspended to her father's arm. It was a pleasure to her to say that any one
was graceful.</p>
            <p>Felix had been looking about him. <q>And your little cousin, of
yesterday,</q> he said, <q>who was so wonderfully pretty—what has
become of her?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She is in the parlor,</q> Gertrude answered. <q>Yes, she is very
pretty.</q> She felt as if it were her duty to take him straight into the
house, to where he might be near her cousin. But<pb n="909"/>
after hesitating a moment she lingered still. <q>I did n't
believe you would come back,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Not come back!</q> cried Felix, laughing. <q>You did n't know, then,
the impression made upon this susceptible heart of mine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She wondered whether he meant the impression her cousin Lizzie had made.
<q>Well,</q> she said, <q>I did n't think we should ever see you
again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And pray what did you think would become of me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know. I thought you would melt away.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's a compliment to my solidity! I melt very often,</q> said
Felix, <q>but there is always something left of me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I came and waited for you by the door, because the others did,</q>
Gertrude went on. <q>But if you had never appeared I should not have been
surprised.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I hope,</q> declared Felix, looking at her, <q>that you would have
been disappointed.</q>
            </p>
            <p> She looked at him a little, and shook her head. <q>No—no!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, <hi rend="italic">par exemple</hi>!</q> cried the young man. <q>You deserve that
I should never leave you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Going into the parlor they found Mr. Wentworth performing introductions.
A young man was standing before the Baroness, blushing a good deal,
laughing a little, and shifting his weight from one foot to the
other—a slim, mild-faced young man, with neatly-arranged features,
like those of Mr. Wentworth. Two other gentlemen, behind him, had risen
from their seats, and a little apart, near one of the windows, stood a
remarkably pretty young girl. The young girl was knitting a stocking; but,
while her fingers quickly moved, she looked with wide, brilliant eyes at
the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And what is your son's name?</q> said Eugenia, smiling at the young
man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My name is Clifford Wentworth, ma'am,</q> he said in a tremulous
voice.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why did n't you come out to meet me, Mr. Clifford Wentworth?</q> the
Baroness demanded, with her beautiful smile.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I did n't think you would want me,</q> said the young man, slowly
sidling about.</p>
            <p>
               <q>One always wants a <hi rend="italic">beau cousin</hi>,—if one has one! But if
you are very nice to me in future I won't remember it against <pb n="910"/>
you.</q> And Madame Münster transferred her smile to the
other persons present. It rested first upon the candid countenance and
long-skirted figure of Mr. Brand, whose eyes were intently fixed upon Mr.
Wentworth, as if to beg him not to prolong an anomalous situation. Mr.
Wentworth pronounced his name. Eugenia gave him a very charming glance, and
then looked at the other gentleman.</p>
            <p>This latter personage was a man of rather less than the usual stature
and the usual weight, with a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a small
quantity of thin dark hair, and a small mustache. He had been standing with
his hands in his pockets; and when Eugenia looked at him he took them out.
But he did not, like Mr. Brand, look evasively and urgently at their host.
He met Eugenia's eyes; he appeared to appreciate the privilege of meeting
them. Madame Münster instantly felt that he was, intrinsically, the
most important person present. She was not unconscious that this impression
was in some degree manifested in the little sympathetic nod with which she
acknowledged Mr. Wentworth's announcement, <q>My cousin, Mr. Acton!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your cousin—not mine?</q> said the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It only depends upon you,</q> Mr. Acton declared, laughing.</p>
            <p>The Baroness looked at him a moment, and noticed that he had very white
teeth. <q>Let it depend upon your behavior,</q> she said. <q>I think I had
better wait. I have cousins enough. Unless I can also claim
relationship,</q> she added, <q>with that charming young lady,</q> and she
pointed to the young girl at the window.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's my sister,</q> said Mr. Acton. And Gertrude Wentworth put her
arm round the young girl and led her forward. It was not, apparently, that
she needed much leading. She came toward the Baroness with a light, quick
step, and with perfect self-possession, rolling her stocking round its
needles. She had dark blue eyes and dark brown hair; she was wonderfully
pretty.</p>
            <p>Eugenia kissed her, as she had kissed the other young women, and then
held her off a little, looking at her. <q>Now this is quite another
<hi rend="italic">type</hi>,</q> she said; she pronounced the word in the French manner.
<q>This is a different outline, my uncle, a different character, from that
of your own daughters. This,<pb n="911"/>
 Felix,</q> she went on, <q>is very much more what we have
always thought of as the American type.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young girl, during this exposition, was smiling askance at every one
in turn, and at Felix out of turn. <q>I find only one type here!</q> cried
Felix, laughing. <q>The type adorable!</q>
            </p>
            <p>This sally was received in perfect silence, but Felix, who learned all
things quickly, had already learned that the silences frequently observed
among his new acquaintances were not necessarily restrictive or resentful.
It was, as one might say, the silence of expectation, of modesty. They were
all standing round his sister, as if they were expecting her to acquit
herself of the exhibition of some peculiar faculty, some brilliant talent.
Their attitude seemed to imply that she was a kind of conversational
mountebank, attired, intellectually, in gauze and spangles. This attitude
gave a certain ironical force to Madame Münster's next words. <q>Now
this is your circle,</q> she said to her uncle. <q>This is your
<hi rend="italic">salon</hi>. These are your regular habitués, eh? I am so glad to
see you all together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, <q>they are always dropping in and out.
You must do the same.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Father,</q> interposed Charlotte Wentworth, <q>they must do something
more.</q> And she turned her sweet, serious face, that seemed at once timid
and placid, upon their interesting visitor. <q>What is your name?</q> she
asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Eugenia-Camilla-Dolores,</q> said the Baroness, smiling. <q>But you
need n't say all that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I will say Eugenia, if you will let me. You must come and stay with
us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness laid her hand upon Charlotte's arm very tenderly; but she
reserved herself. She was wondering whether it would be possible to
<q>stay</q> with these people. <q>It would be very charming—very
charming,</q> she said; and her eyes wandered over the company, over the
room. She wished to gain time before committing herself. Her glance fell
upon young Mr. Brand, who stood there, with his arms folded and his hand on
his chin, looking at her. <q>The gentleman, I suppose, is a sort of
ecclesiastic,</q> she said to Mr. Wentworth, lowering her voice a
little.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He is a minister,</q> answered Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A Protestant?</q> asked Eugenia.<pb n="912"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am a Unitarian, madam,</q> replied Mr. Brand,
impressively.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, I see,</q> said Eugenia. <q>Something new.</q> She had never
heard of this form of worship.</p>
            <p>Mr. Acton began to laugh, and Gertrude looked anxiously at Mr.
Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have come very far,</q> said Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Very far—very far,</q> the Baroness replied, with a graceful
shake of her head—a shake that might have meant many different
things.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's a reason why you ought to settle down with us,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth, with that dryness of utterance which, as Eugenia was too
intelligent not to feel, took nothing from the delicacy of his meaning.</p>
            <p>She looked at him, and for an instant, in his cold, still face, she
seemed to see a far-away likeness to the vaguely remembered image of her
mother. Eugenia was a woman of sudden emotions, and now, unexpectedly, she
felt one rising in her heart. She kept looking round the circle; she knew
that there was admiration in all the eyes that were fixed upon her. She
smiled at them all.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I came to look—to try—to ask,</q> she said. <q>It seems
to me I have done well. I am very tired; I want to rest.</q> There were
tears in her eyes. The luminous interior, the gentle, tranquil people, the
simple, serious life—the sense of these things pressed upon her with
an overmastering force, and she felt herself yielding to one of the most
genuine emotions she had ever known. <q>I should like to stay here,</q> she
said. <q>Pray take me in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though she was smiling, there were tears in her voice as well as in her
eyes. <q>My dear niece,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, softly. And Charlotte put
out her arms and drew the Baroness toward her; while Robert Acton turned
away, with his hands stealing into his pockets.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>Chapter 4</head>
            <pb n="913"/>
            <p>A few days after the Baroness Münster had presented herself to her
American kinsfolk she came, with her brother, and took up her abode in that
small white house adjacent to Mr. Wentworth's own dwelling of which mention
has already been made. It was on going with his daughters to return her
visit that Mr. Wentworth placed this comfortable cottage at her service;
the offer being the result of a domestic colloquy, diffused through the
ensuing twenty-four hours, in the course of which the two foreign visitors
were discussed and analyzed with a great deal of earnestness and subtlety.
The discussion went forward, as I say, in the family circle; but that
circle on the evening following Madame Münster's return to town, as on
many other occasions, included Robert Acton and his pretty sister. If you
had been present, it would probably not have seemed to you that the advent
of these brilliant strangers was treated as an exhilarating occurrence, a
pleasure the more in this tranquil household, a prospective source of
entertainment. This was not Mr. Wentworth's way of treating any human
occurrence. The sudden irruption into the well-ordered consciousness of the
Wentworths of an element not allowed for in its scheme of usual obligations
required a readjustment of that sense of responsibility which constituted
its principal furniture. To consider an event, crudely and baldly, in the
light of the pleasure it might bring them was an intellectual exercise with
which Felix Young's American cousins were almost wholly unacquainted, and
which they scarcely supposed to be largely pursued in any section of human
society. The arrival of Felix and his sister was a satisfaction, but it was
a singularly joyless and inelastic satisfaction. It was an extension of
duty, of the exercise of the more recondite virtues; but neither Mr.
Wentworth, nor Charlotte, nor Mr. Brand, who, among these excellent people,
was a great promoter of reflection and aspiration, frankly adverted to it
as an extension of enjoyment. This function was ultimately assumed by
Gertrude Wentworth, who was a peculiar girl, but the full compass of whose
peculiarities had not been exhibited before they very ingeniously found
their pretext<pb n="914"/>
 in the presence of these possibly too agreeable foreigners.
Gertrude, however, had to struggle with a great accumulation of
obstructions, both of the subjective, as the metaphysicians say, and of the
objective, order; and indeed it is no small part of the purpose of this
little history to set forth her struggle. What seemed paramount in this
abrupt enlargement of Mr. Wentworth's sympathies and those of his daughters
was an extension of the field of possible mistakes; and the doctrine, as it
may almost be called, of the oppressive gravity of mistakes was one of the
most cherished traditions of the Wentworth family.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't believe she wants to come and stay in this house,</q> said
Gertrude; Madame Münster, from this time forward, receiving no other
designation than the personal pronoun. Charlotte and Gertrude acquired
considerable facility in addressing her, directly, as <q>Eugenia;</q> but
in speaking of her to each other they rarely called her anything but
<q>she.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Does n't she think it good enough for her?</q> cried little Lizzie
Acton, who was always asking unpractical questions that required, in
strictness, no answer, and to which indeed she expected no other answer
than such as she herself invariably furnished in a small,
innocently-satirical laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She certainly expressed a willingness to come,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That was only politeness,</q> Gertrude rejoined.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, she is very polite—very polite,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She is too polite,</q> his son declared, in a softly growling tone
which was habitual to him, but which was an indication of nothing worse
than a vaguely humorous intention. <q>It is very embarrassing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is more than can be said of you, sir,</q> said Lizzie Acton,
with her little laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I don't mean to encourage her,</q> Clifford went on.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I 'm sure I don't care if you do!</q> cried Lizzie.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She will not think of you, Clifford,</q> said Gertrude, gravely.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I hope not!</q> Clifford exclaimed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She will think of Robert,</q> Gertrude continued, in the same
tone.</p>
            <p>Robert Acton began to blush; but there was no occasion <pb n="915"/>
for it, for every one was looking at Gertrude—every one,
at least, save Lizzie, who, with her pretty head on one side, contemplated
her brother.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why do you attribute motives, Gertrude?</q> asked Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't attribute motives, father,</q> said Gertrude. <q>I only say
she will think of Robert; and she will!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Gertrude judges by herself!</q> Acton exclaimed, laughing. <q>Don't
you, Gertrude? Of course the Baroness will think of me. She will think of
me from morning till night.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She will be very comfortable here,</q> said Charlotte, with something
of a housewife's pride. <q>She can have the large northeast room. And the
French bedstead,</q> Charlotte added, with a constant sense of the lady's
foreignness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She will not like it,</q> said Gertrude; <q>not even if you pin
little tidies all over the chairs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why not, dear?</q> asked Charlotte, perceiving a touch of irony here,
but not resenting it.</p>
            <p>Gertrude had left her chair; she was walking about the room; her stiff
silk dress, which she had put on in honor of the Baroness, made a sound
upon the carpet. <q>I don't know,</q> she replied. <q>She will want
something more—more private.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If she wants to be private she can stay in her room,</q> Lizzie Acton
remarked.</p>
            <p>Gertrude paused in her walk, looking at her. <q>That would not be
pleasant,</q> she answered. <q>She wants privacy and pleasure
together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Robert Acton began to laugh again. <q>My dear cousin, what a
picture!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte had fixed her serious eyes upon her sister; she wondered
whence she had suddenly derived these strange notions. Mr. Wentworth also
observed his younger daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know what her manner of life may have been,</q> he said;
<q>but she certainly never can have enjoyed a more refined and salubrious
home.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude stood there looking at them all. <q>She is the wife of a
Prince,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We are all princes here,</q> said Mr. Wentworth; <q>and I don't know
of any palace in this neighborhood that is to let.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Cousin William,</q> Robert Acton interposed, <q>do you want<pb n="916"/>
 to do something handsome? Make them a present, for three
months, of the little house over the way.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are very generous with other people's things!</q> cried his
sister.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Robert is very generous with his own things,</q> Mr. Wentworth
observed dispassionately, and looking, in cold meditation, at his
kinsman.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Gertrude,</q> Lizzie went on, <q>I had an idea you were so fond of
your new cousin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Which new cousin?</q> asked Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't mean the Baroness!</q> the young girl rejoined, with her
laugh. <q>I thought you expected to see so much of him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Of Felix? I hope to see a great deal of him,</q> said Gertrude,
simply.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Then why do you want to keep him out of the house?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at Lizzie Acton, and then looked away.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Should you want me to live in the house with you, Lizzie?</q> asked
Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I hope you never will. I hate you!</q> Such was this young lady's
reply.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Father,</q> said Gertrude, stopping before Mr. Wentworth and smiling,
with a smile the sweeter, as her smile always was, for its rarity; <q>do
let them live in the little house over the way. It will be lovely!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Robert Acton had been watching her. <q>Gertrude is right,</q> he said.
<q>Gertrude is the cleverest girl in the world. If I might take the
liberty, I should strongly recommend their living there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There is nothing there so pretty as the northeast room,</q> Charlotte
urged.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She will make it pretty. Leave her alone!</q> Acton exclaimed.</p>
            <p>Gertrude, at his compliment, had blushed and looked at him: it was as if
some one less familiar had complimented her. <q>I am sure she will make it
pretty. It will be very interesting. It will be a place to go to. It will
be a foreign house.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Are we very sure that we need a foreign house?</q> Mr. Wentworth
inquired. <q>Do you think it desirable to establish a foreign
house—in this quiet place?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You speak,</q> said Acton, laughing, <q>as if it were a
question<pb n="917"/>
 of the poor Baroness opening a wine-shop or a
gaming-table.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It would be too lovely!</q> Gertrude declared again, laying her hand
on the back of her father's chair.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That she should open a gaming-table?</q> Charlotte asked, with great
gravity.</p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at her a moment, and then, <q>Yes, Charlotte,</q> she
said, simply.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Gertrude is growing pert,</q> Clifford Wentworth observed, with his
humorous young growl. <q>That comes of associating with foreigners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth looked up at his daughter, who was standing beside him; he
drew her gently forward. <q>You must be careful,</q> he said. <q>You must
keep watch. Indeed, we must all be careful. This is a great change; we are
to be exposed to peculiar influences. I don't say they are bad. I don't
judge them in advance. But they may perhaps make it necessary that we
should exercise a great deal of wisdom and self-control. It will be a
different tone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude was silent a moment, in deference to her father's speech; then
she spoke in a manner that was not in the least an answer to it. <q>I want
to see how they will live. I am sure they will have different hours. She
will do all kinds of little things differently. When we go over there it
will be like going to Europe. She will have a boudoir. She will invite us
to dinner—very late. She will breakfast in her room.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte gazed at her sister again. Gertrude's imagination seemed to
her to be fairly running riot. She had always known that Gertrude had a
great deal of imagination—she had been very proud of it. But at the
same time she had always felt that it was a dangerous and irresponsible
faculty; and now, to her sense, for the moment, it seemed to threaten to
make her sister a strange person who should come in suddenly, as from a
journey, talking of the peculiar and possibly unpleasant things she had
observed. Charlotte's imagination took no journeys whatever; she kept it,
as it were, in her pocket, with the other furniture of this
receptacle—a thimble, a little box of peppermint, and a morsel of
court-plaster. <q>I don't believe she would have any dinner—or any
breakfast,</q> said Miss Wentworth. <q>I don't believe she knows how to
do<pb n="918"/>
 anything herself. I should have to get her ever so many
servants, and she would n't like them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She has a maid,</q> said Gertrude; <q>a French maid. She mentioned
her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I wonder if the maid has a little fluted cap and red slippers,</q>
said Lizzie Acton. <q>There was a French maid in that play that Robert took
me to see. She had pink stockings; she was very wicked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She was a <hi rend="italic">soubrette</hi>,</q> Gertrude announced, who had never
seen a play in her life. <q>They call that a soubrette. It will be a great
chance to learn French.</q> Charlotte gave a little soft, helpless groan.
She had a vision of a wicked, theatrical person, clad in pink stockings and
red shoes, and speaking, with confounding volubility, an incomprehensible
tongue, flitting through the sacred penetralia of that large, clean house.
<q>That is one reason in favor of their coming here,</q> Gertrude went on.
<q>But we can make Eugenia speak French to us, and Felix. I mean to
begin—the next time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth had kept her standing near him, and he gave her his
earnest, thin, unresponsive glance again. <q>I want you to make me a
promise, Gertrude,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What is it?</q> she asked, smiling.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Not to get excited. Not to allow these—these occurrences to be
an occasion for excitement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She looked down at him a moment, and then she shook her head. <q>I don't
think I can promise that, father. I am excited already.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth was silent a while; they all were silent, as if in
recognition of something audacious and portentous.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I think they had better go to the other house,</q> said Charlotte,
quietly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall keep them in the other house,</q> Mr. Wentworth subjoined,
more pregnantly.</p>
            <p>Gertrude turned away; then she looked across at Robert Acton. Her cousin
Robert was a great friend of hers; she often looked at him this way instead
of saying things. Her glance on this occasion, however, struck him as a
substitute for a larger volume of diffident utterance than usual, inviting
him to observe, among other things, the inefficiency of her father's
design—if design it was—for diminishing, in the interest<pb n="919"/>
 of quiet nerves, their occasions of contact with their foreign
relatives. But Acton immediately complimented Mr. Wentworth upon his
liberality. <q>That 's a very nice thing to do,</q> he said, <q>giving them
the little house. You will have treated them handsomely, and, whatever
happens, you will be glad of it.</q> Mr. Wentworth was liberal, and he knew
he was liberal. It gave him pleasure to know it, to feel it, to see it
recorded; and this pleasure is the only palpable form of self-indulgence
with which the narrator of these incidents will be able to charge him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A three days' visit at most, over there, is all I should have found
possible,</q> Madame Münster remarked to her brother, after they had
taken possession of the little white house. <q>It would have been too
<hi rend="italic">intime</hi>—decidedly too intime. Breakfast, dinner, and tea <hi rend="italic">en
famille</hi>—it would have been the end of the world if I could have
reached the third day.</q> And she made the same observation to her maid
Augustine, an intelligent person, who enjoyed a liberal share of her
confidence. Felix declared that he would willingly spend his life in the
bosom of the Wentworth family; that they were the kindest, simplest, most
amiable people in the world, and that he had taken a prodigious fancy to
them all. The Baroness quite agreed with him that they were simple and
kind; they were thoroughly nice people, and she liked them extremely. The
girls were perfect ladies; it was impossible to be more of a lady than
Charlotte Wentworth, in spite of her little village air. <q>But as for
thinking them the best company in the world,</q> said the Baroness, <q>that
is another thing; and as for wishing to live <hi rend="italic">porte à porte</hi>
with them, I should as soon think of wishing myself back in the convent
again, to wear a bombazine apron and sleep in a dormitory.</q> And yet the
Baroness was in high good humor; she had been very much pleased. With her
lively perception and her refined imagination, she was capable of enjoying
anything that was characteristic, anything that was good of its kind. The
Wentworth household seemed to her very perfect in its
kind—wonderfully peaceful and unspotted; pervaded by a sort of
dove-colored freshness that had all the quietude and benevolence of what
she deemed to be Quakerism, and yet seemed to be founded upon a degree of
material abundance for which, in certain matters of <pb n="920"/>
detail, one might have looked in vain at the frugal little
court of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. She perceived immediately that her
American relatives thought and talked very little about money; and this of
itself made an impression upon Eugenia's imagination. She perceived at the
same time that if Charlotte or Gertrude should ask their father for a very
considerable sum he would at once place it in their hands; and this made a
still greater impression. The greatest impression of all, perhaps, was made
by another rapid induction. The Baroness had an immediate conviction that
Robert Acton would put his hand into his pocket every day in the week if
that rattle-pated little sister of his should bid him. The men in this
country, said the Baroness, are evidently very obliging. Her declaration
that she was looking for rest and retirement had been by no means wholly
untrue; nothing that the Baroness said was wholly untrue. It is but fair to
add, perhaps, that nothing that she said was wholly true. She wrote to a
friend in Germany that it was a return to nature; it was like drinking new
milk, and she was very fond of new milk. She said to herself, of course,
that it would be a little dull; but there can be no better proof of her
good spirits than the fact that she thought she should not mind its being a
little dull. It seemed to her, when from the piazza of her eleemosynary
cottage she looked out over the soundless fields, the stony pastures, the
clear-faced ponds, the rugged little orchards, that she had never been in
the midst of so peculiarly intense a stillness; it was almost a delicate
sensual pleasure. It was all very good, very innocent and safe, and out of
it something good must come. Augustine, indeed, who had an unbounded faith
in her mistress's wisdom and far-sightedness, was a great deal perplexed
and depressed. She was always ready to take her cue when she understood it;
but she liked to understand it, and on this occasion comprehension failed.
What, indeed, was the Baroness doing <hi rend="italic">dans cette galère?</hi> what
fish did she expect to land out of these very stagnant waters? The game was
evidently a deep one. Augustine could trust her; but the sense of walking
in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy of this spare, sober,
sallow, middle-aged person, who had nothing in common with Gertrude
Wentworth's conception of a soubrette, by the most ironical scowl that had
ever rested upon the unpretending<pb n="921"/>
 tokens of the peace and plenty of  the Wentworths.
Fortunately, Augustine could quench skepticism in action. She quite agreed
with her mistress—or rather she quite out-stripped her
mistress—in thinking that the little white house was pitifully bare.
<q>Il faudra,</q> said Augustine, <q>lui faire un peu de toilette.</q> And
she began to hang up <hi rend="italic">portières</hi> in the doorways; to place wax
candles, procured after some research, in unexpected situations; to dispose
anomalous draperies over the arms of sofas and the backs of chairs. The
Baroness had brought with her to the New World a copious provision of the
element of costume; and the two Miss Wentworths, when they came over to see
her, were somewhat bewildered by the obtrusive distribution of her
wardrobe. There were India shawls suspended, curtain-wise, in the parlor
door, and curious fabrics, corresponding to Gertrude's metaphysical vision
of an opera-cloak, tumbled about in the sitting-places. There were pink
silk blinds in the windows, by which the room was strangely bedimmed; and
along the chimney-piece was disposed a remarkable band of velvet, covered
with coarse, dirty-looking lace. <q>I have been making myself a little
comfortable,</q> said the Baroness, much to the confusion of Charlotte, who
had been on the point of proposing to come and help her put her superfluous
draperies away. But what Charlotte mistook for an almost culpably delayed
subsidence Gertrude very presently perceived to be the most ingenious, the
most interesting, the most romantic intention. <q>What is life, indeed,
without curtains?</q> she secretly asked herself; and she appeared to
herself to have been leading hitherto an existence singularly garish and
totally devoid of festoons.</p>
            <p>Felix was not a young man who troubled himself greatly about
anything—least of all about the conditions of enjoyment. His faculty
of enjoyment was so large, so unconsciously eager, that it may be said of
it that it had a permanent advance upon embarrassment and sorrow. His
sentient faculty was intrinsically joyous, and novelty and change were in
themselves a delight to him. As they had come to him with a great deal of
frequency, his life had been more agreeable than appeared. Never was a
nature more perfectly fortunate. It was not a restless, apprehensive,
ambitious spirit, running a race with the tyranny of fate, but a temper so
unsuspicious as to<pb n="922"/>
 put Adversity off her guard, dodging and evading her with the
easy, natural motion of a wind-shifted flower. Felix extracted
entertainment from all things, and all his faculties—his imagination,
his intelligence, his affections, his senses—had a hand in the game.
It seemed to him that Eugenia and he had been very well treated; there was
something absolutely touching in that combination of paternal liberality
and social considerateness which marked Mr. Wentworth's deportment. It was
most uncommonly kind of him, for instance, to have given them a house.
Felix was positively amused at having a house of his own; for the little
white cottage among the apple-trees—the chalet, as Madame
Münster always called it—was much more sensibly his own than any
domiciliary <hi rend="italic">quatrième</hi>, looking upon a court, with the rent
overdue. Felix had spent a good deal of his life in looking into courts,
with a perhaps slightly tattered pair of elbows resting upon the ledge of a
high-perched window, and the thin smoke of a cigarette rising into an
atmosphere in which street-cries died away and the vibration of chimes from
ancient belfries became sensible. He had never known anything so infinitely
rural as these New England fields; and he took a great fancy to all their
pastoral roughnesses. He had never had a greater sense of luxurious
security; and at the risk of making him seem a rather sordid adventurer I
must declare that he found an irresistible charm in the fact that he might
dine every day at his uncle's. The charm was irresistible, however, because
his fancy flung a rosy light over this homely privilege. He appreciated
highly the fare that was set before him. There was a kind of fresh-looking
abundance about it which made him think that people must have lived so in
the mythological era, when they spread their tables upon the grass,
replenished them from cornucopias, and had no particular need of kitchen
stoves. But the great thing that Felix enjoyed was having found a
family—sitting in the midst of gentle, generous people whom he might
call by their first names. He had never known anything more charming than
the attention they paid to what he said. It was like a large sheet of
clean, fine-grained drawing-paper, all ready to be washed over with
effective splashes of water-color. He had never had any cousins, and he had
never before found himself in contact so unrestricted with young
unmarried<pb n="923"/>
 ladies. He was extremely fond of the society of ladies, and it
was new to him that it might be enjoyed in just this manner. At first he
hardly knew what to make of his state of mind. It seemed to him that he was
in love, indiscriminately, with three girls at once. He saw that Lizzie
Acton was more brilliantly pretty than Charlotte and Gertrude; but this was
scarcely a superiority. His pleasure came from something they had in
common—a part of which was, indeed, that physical delicacy which
seemed to make it proper that they should always dress in thin materials
and clear colors. But they were delicate in other ways, and it was most
agreeable to him to feel that these latter delicacies were appreciable by
contact, as it were. He had known, fortunately, many virtuous gentlewomen,
but it now appeared to him that in his relations with them (especially when
they were unmarried) he had been looking at pictures under glass. He
perceived at present what a nuisance the glass had been—how it
perverted and interfered, how it caught the reflection of other objects and
kept you walking from side to side. He had no need to ask himself whether
Charlotte and Gertrude, and Lizzie Acton, were in the right light; they
were always in the right light. He liked everything about them: he was, for
instance, not at all above liking the fact that they had very slender feet
and high insteps. He liked their pretty noses; he liked their surprised
eyes and their hesitating, not at all positive way of speaking; he liked so
much knowing that he was perfectly at liberty to be alone for hours,
anywhere, with either of them; that preference for one to the other, as a
companion of solitude, remained a minor affair. Charlotte Wentworth's
sweetly severe features were as agreeable as Lizzie Acton's wonderfully
expressive blue eyes; and Gertrude's air of being always ready to walk
about and listen was as charming as anything else, especially as she walked
very gracefully. After a while Felix began to distinguish; but even then he
would often wish, suddenly, that they were not all so sad. Even Lizzie
Acton, in spite of her fine little chatter and laughter, appeared sad. Even
Clifford Wentworth, who had extreme youth in his favor, and kept a buggy
with enormous wheels and a little sorrel mare with the prettiest legs in
the world—even this fortunate lad was apt to have an averted,
uncomfortable glance, and to edge away<pb n="924"/>
 from you at times, in the manner of a person with a bad
conscience. The only person in the circle with no sense of oppression of
any kind was, to Felix's perception, Robert Acton.</p>
            <p>It might perhaps have been feared that after the completion of those
graceful domiciliary embellishments which have been mentioned Madame
Münster would have found herself confronted with alarming
possibilities of <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>. But as yet she had not taken the alarm. The
Baroness was a restless soul, and she projected her restlessness, as it may
be said, into any situation that lay before her. Up to a certain point her
restlessness might be counted upon to entertain her. She was always
expecting something to happen, and, until it was disappointed, expectancy
itself was a delicate pleasure. What the Baroness expected just now it
would take some ingenuity to set forth; it is enough that while she looked
about her she found something to occupy her imagination. She assured
herself that she was enchanted with her new relatives; she professed to
herself that, like her brother, she felt it a sacred satisfaction to have
found a family. It is certain that she enjoyed to the utmost the gentleness
of her kinsfolk's deference. She had, first and last, received a great deal
of admiration, and her experience of well-turned compliments was very
considerable; but she knew that she had never been so real a power, never
counted for so much, as now when, for the first time, the standard of
comparison of her little circle was a prey to vagueness. The sense, indeed,
that the good people about her had, as regards her remarkable self, no
standard of comparison at all gave her a feeling of almost illimitable
power. It was true, as she said to herself, that if for this reason they
would be able to discover nothing against her, so they would perhaps
neglect to perceive some of her superior points; but she always wound up
her reflections by declaring that she would take care of that.</p>
            <p>Charlotte and Gertrude were in some perplexity between their desire to
show all proper attention to Madame Münster and their fear of being
importunate. The little house in the orchard had hitherto been occupied
during the summer months by intimate friends of the family, or by poor
relations<pb n="925"/>
 who found in Mr. Wentworth a landlord attentive to repairs and
oblivious of quarter-day. Under these circumstances the open door of the
small house and that of the large one, facing each other across their
homely gardens, levied no tax upon hourly visits. But the Misses Wentworth
received an impression that Eugenia was no friend to the primitive custom
of <q>dropping in;</q> she evidently had no idea of living without a
door-keeper. <q>One goes into your house as into an inn—except that
there are no servants rushing forward,</q> she said to Charlotte. And she
added that that was very charming. Gertrude explained to her sister that
she meant just the reverse; she did n't like it at all. Charlotte inquired
why she should tell an untruth, and Gertrude answered that there was
probably some very good reason for it which they should discover when they
knew her better. <q>There can surely be no good reason for telling an
untruth,</q> said Charlotte. <q>I hope she does not think so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They had of course desired, from the first, to do everything in the way
of helping her to arrange herself. It had seemed to Charlotte that there
would be a great many things to talk about; but the Baroness was apparently
inclined to talk about nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Write her a note, asking her leave to come and see her. I think that
is what she will like,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why should I give her the trouble of answering me?</q> Charlotte
asked. <q>She will have to write a note and send it over.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't think she will take any trouble,</q> said Gertrude,
profoundly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What then will she do?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is what I am curious to see,</q> said Gertrude, leaving her
sister with an impression that her curiosity was morbid.</p>
            <p>They went to see the Baroness without preliminary correspondence; and in
the little salon which she had already created, with its becoming light and
its festoons, they found Robert Acton.</p>
            <p>Eugenia was intensely gracious, but she accused them of neglecting her
cruelly. <q>You see Mr. Acton has had to take pity upon me,</q> she said.
<q>My brother goes off sketching, for<pb n="926"/>
 hours; I can never depend upon him. So I was to send Mr. Acton
to beg you to come and give me the benefit of your wisdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at her sister. She wanted to say, <q>That is what she
would have done.</q> Charlotte said that they hoped the Baroness would
always come and dine with them; it would give them so much pleasure; and,
in that case, she would spare herself the trouble of having a cook.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, but I must have a cook!</q> cried the Baroness. <q>An old negress
in a yellow turban. I have set my heart upon that. I want to look out of my
window and see her sitting there on the grass, against the background of
those crooked, dusky little apple-trees, pulling the husks off a lapful of
Indian corn. That will be local color, you know. There is n't much of it
here—you don't mind my saying that, do you?—so one must make
the most of what one can get. I shall be most happy to dine with you
whenever you will let me; but I want to be able to ask you sometimes. And I
want to be able to ask Mr. Acton,</q> added the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You must come and ask me at home,</q> said Acton. <q>You must come
and see me; you must dine with me first. I want to show you my place; I
want to introduce you to my mother.</q> He called again upon Madame
Münster, two days later. He was constantly at the other house; he used
to walk across the fields from his own place, and he appeared to have fewer
scruples than his cousins with regard to dropping in. On this occasion he
found that Mr. Brand had come to pay his respects to the charming stranger;
but after Acton's arrival the young theologian said nothing. He sat in his
chair with his two hands clasped, fixing upon his hostess a grave,
fascinated stare. The Baroness talked to Robert Acton, but, as she talked,
she turned and smiled at Mr. Brand, who never took his eyes off her. The
two men walked away together; they were going to Mr. Wentworth's. Mr. Brand
still said nothing; but after they had passed into Mr. Wentworth's garden
he stopped and looked back for some time at the little white house. Then,
looking at his companion, with his head bent a little to one side and his
eyes somewhat contracted, <q>Now I suppose that 's what is called
conversation,</q> he said; <q>real conversation.</q>
               <pb n="927"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's what I call a very clever woman,</q> said Acton,
laughing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is most interesting,</q> Mr. Brand continued. <q>I only wish she
would speak French; it would seem more in keeping. It must be quite the
style that we have heard about, that we have read about—the style of
conversation of Madame de Staël, of Madame Récamier.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton also looked at Madame Münster's residence among its
hollyhocks and apple-trees. <q>What I should like to know,</q> he said,
smiling, <q>is just what has brought Madame Récamier to live in that
place!</q>
            </p>

            <pb n="928"/>
            <p>Mr. wentworth, with his cane and his gloves in his hand, went every
afternoon to call upon his niece. A couple of hours later she came over to
the great house to tea. She had let the proposal that she should regularly
dine there fall to the ground; she was in the enjoyment of whatever
satisfaction was to be derived from the spectacle of an old negress in a
crimson turban shelling peas under the apple-trees. Charlotte, who had
provided the ancient negress, thought it must be a strange household,
Eugenia having told her that Augustine managed everything, the ancient
negress included—Augustine who was naturally devoid of all
acquaintance with the expurgatory English tongue. By far the most immoral
sentiment which I shall have occasion to attribute to Charlotte Wentworth
was a certain emotion of disappointment at finding that, in spite of these
irregular conditions, the domestic arrangements at the small house were
apparently not—from Eugenia's peculiar point of view—strikingly
offensive. The Baroness found it amusing to go to tea; she dressed as if
for dinner. The tea-table offered an anomalous and picturesque repast; and
on leaving it they all sat and talked in the large piazza, or wandered
about the garden in the starlight, with their ears full of those sounds of
strange insects which, though they are supposed to be, all over the world,
a part of the magic of summer nights, seemed to the Baroness to have
beneath these western skies an incomparable resonance.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth, though, as I say, he went punctiliously to call upon her,
was not able to feel that he was getting used to his niece. It taxed his
imagination to believe that she was really his half-sister's child. His
sister was a figure of his early years; she had been only twenty when she
went abroad, never to return, making in foreign parts a willful and
undesirable marriage. His aunt, Mrs. Whiteside, who had taken her to Europe
for the benefit of the tour, gave, on her return, so lamentable an account
of Mr. Adolphus Young, to whom the headstrong girl had united her destiny,
that it operated as a chill upon family feeling—especially in the
case of the half-brothers. <pb n="929"/>
Catherine had done nothing subsequently to propitiate her
family; she had not even written to them in a way that indicated a lucid
appreciation of their suspended sympathy; so that it had become a tradition
in Boston circles that the highest charity, as regards this young lady, was
to think it well to forget her, and to abstain from conjecture as to the
extent to which her aberrations were reproduced in her descendants. Over
these young people—a vague report of their existence had come to his
ears—Mr. Wentworth had not, in the course of years, allowed his
imagination to hover. It had plenty of occupation nearer home, and though
he had many cares upon his conscience the idea that he had been an
unnatural uncle was, very properly, never among the number. Now that his
nephew and niece had come before him, he perceived that they were the fruit
of influences and circumstances very different from those under which his
own familiar progeny had reached a vaguely-qualified maturity. He felt no
provocation to say that these influences had been exerted for evil; but he
was sometimes afraid that he should not be able to like his distinguished,
delicate, lady-like niece. He was paralyzed and bewildered by her
foreignness. She spoke, somehow, a different language. There was something
strange in her words. He had a feeling that another man, in his place,
would accommodate himself to her tone; would ask her questions and joke
with her, reply to those pleasantries of her own which sometimes seemed
startling as addressed to an uncle. But Mr. Wentworth could not do these
things. He could not even bring himself to attempt to measure her position
in the world. She was the wife of a foreign nobleman who desired to
repudiate her. This had a singular sound, but the old man felt himself
destitute of the materials for a judgment. It seemed to him that he ought
to find them in his own experience, as a man of the world and an almost
public character; but they were not there, and he was ashamed to confess to
himself—much more to reveal to Eugenia by interrogations possibly too
innocent—the unfurnished condition of this repository.</p>
            <p>It appeared to him that he could get much nearer, as he would have said,
to his nephew; though he was not sure that Felix was altogether safe. He
was so bright and handsome <pb n="930"/>
and talkative that it was impossible not to think well of him;
and yet it seemed as if there were something almost impudent, almost
vicious—or as if there ought to be—in a young man being at once
so joyous and so positive. It was to be observed that while Felix was not
at all a serious young man there was somehow more of him—he had more
weight and volume and resonance—than a number of young men who were
distinctly serious. While Mr. Wentworth meditated upon this anomaly his
nephew was admiring him unrestrictedly. He thought him a most delicate,
generous, high-toned old gentleman, with a very handsome head, of the
ascetic type, which he promised himself the profit of sketching. Felix was
far from having made a secret of the fact that he wielded the paint-brush,
and it was not his own fault if it failed to be generally understood that
he was prepared to execute the most striking likenesses on the most
reasonable terms. <q>He is an artist—my cousin is an artist,</q> said
Gertrude; and she offered this information to every one who would receive
it. She offered it to herself, as it were, by way of admonition and
reminder; she repeated to herself at odd moments, in lonely places, that
Felix was invested with this sacred character. Gertrude had never seen an
artist before; she had only read about such people. They seemed to her a
romantic and mysterious class, whose life was made up of those agreeable
accidents that never happened to other persons. And it merely quickened her
meditations on this point that Felix should declare, as he repeatedly did,
that he was really not an artist. <q>I have never gone into the thing
seriously,</q> he said. <q>I have never studied; I have had no training. I
do a little of everything, and nothing well. I am only an amateur.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It pleased Gertrude even more to think that he was an amateur than to
think that he was an artist; the former word, to her fancy, had an even
subtler connotation. She knew, however, that it was a word to use more
soberly. Mr. Wentworth used it freely; for though he had not been exactly
familiar with it, he found it convenient as a help toward classifying
Felix, who, as a young man extremely clever and active and apparently
respectable and yet not engaged in any recognized business, was an
importunate anomaly. Of course the Baroness <pb n="931"/>
and her brother—she was always spoken of first—were
a welcome topic of conversation between Mr. Wentworth and his daughters and
their occasional visitors.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And the young man, your nephew, what is his profession?</q> asked an
old gentleman—Mr. Broderip, of Salem—who had been Mr.
Wentworth's classmate at Harvard College in the year 1809, and who came
into his office in Devonshire Street. (Mr. Wentworth, in his later years,
used to go but three times a week to his office, where he had a large
amount of highly confidential trust-business to transact.)</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, he 's an amateur,</q> said Felix's uncle, with folded hands,
and with a certain satisfaction in being able to say it. And Mr. Broderip
had gone back to Salem with a feeling that this was probably a
<q>European</q> expression for a broker or a grain exporter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I should like to do your head, sir,</q> said Felix  to his uncle one
evening, before them all—Mr. Brand and Robert Acton being also
present. <q>I think I should make a very fine thing of it. It 's an
interesting head; it 's very mediæval.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth looked grave; he felt awkwardly, as if all the company had
come in and found him standing before the looking-glass. <q>The Lord made
it,</q> he said. <q>I don't think it is for man to make it over
again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Certainly the Lord made it,</q> replied Felix, laughing, <q>and he
made it very well. But life has been touching up the work. It is a very
interesting type of head. It 's delightfully wasted and emaciated. The
complexion is wonderfully bleached.</q> And Felix looked round at the
circle, as if to call their attention to these interesting points. Mr.
Wentworth grew visibly paler. <q>I should like to do you as an old prelate,
an old cardinal, or the prior of an order.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A prelate, a cardinal?</q> murmured Mr. Wentworth. <q>Do you refer to
the Roman Catholic priesthood?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I mean an old ecclesiastic who should have led a very pure, abstinent
life. Now I take it that has been the case with you, sir; one sees it in
your face,</q> Felix proceeded. <q>You have been very—a—very
moderate. Don't you think one always sees that in a man's face?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You see more in a man's face than I should think of looking for,</q>
said Mr. Wentworth coldly.<pb n="932"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness rattled her fan, and gave her brilliant laugh.
<q>It is a risk to look so close!</q> she exclaimed. <q>My uncle has some
peccadilloes on his conscience.</q> Mr. Wentworth looked at her, painfully
at a loss; and in so far as the signs of a pure and abstinent life were
visible in his face they were then probably peculiarly manifest. <q>You are
a beau vieillard, dear uncle,</q> said Madame Münster, smiling with
her foreign eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I think you are paying me a compliment,</q> said the old man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Surely, I am not the first woman that ever did so!</q> cried the
Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I think you are,</q> said Mr. Wentworth gravely. And turning to Felix
he added, in the same tone, <q>Please don't take my likeness. My children
have my daguerreotype. That is quite satisfactory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I won't promise,</q> said Felix, <q>not to work your head into
something!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth looked at him and then at all the others; then he got up
and slowly walked away.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Felix,</q> said Gertrude, in the silence that followed, <q>I wish you
would paint my portrait.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte wondered whether Gertrude was right in wishing this; and she
looked at Mr. Brand as the most legitimate way of ascertaining. Whatever
Gertrude did or said, Charlotte always looked at Mr. Brand. It was a
standing pretext for looking at Mr. Brand—always, as Charlotte
thought, in the interest of Gertrude's welfare. It is true that she felt a
tremulous interest in Gertrude being right; for Charlotte, in her small,
still way, was an heroic sister.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We should be glad to have your portrait, Miss Gertrude,</q> said Mr.
Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I should be delighted to paint so charming a model,</q> Felix
declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you think you are so lovely, my dear?</q> asked Lizzie Acton, with
her little inoffensive pertness, biting off a knot in her knitting.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not because I think I am beautiful,</q> said Gertrude, looking
all round. <q>I don't think I am beautiful, at all.</q> She spoke with a
sort of conscious deliberateness; and it seemed <pb n="933"/>
very strange to Charlotte to hear her discussing this question
so publicly. <q>It is because I think it would be amusing to sit and be
painted. I have always thought that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am sorry you have not had better things to think about, my
daughter,</q> said Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You are very beautiful, cousin Gertrude,</q> Felix declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's a compliment,</q> said Gertrude. <q>I put all the compliments
I receive into a little money-jug that has a slit in the side. I shake them
up and down, and they rattle. There are not many yet—only two or
three.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No, it 's not a compliment,</q> Felix rejoined. <q>See; I am careful
not to give it the form of a compliment. I did n't think you were beautiful
at first. But you have come to seem so little by little.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Take care, now, your jug does n't burst!</q> exclaimed Lizzie.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I think sitting for one's portrait is only one of the various forms
of idleness,</q> said Mr. Wentworth. <q>Their name is legion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear sir,</q> cried Felix, <q>you can't be said to be idle when
you are making a man work so!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One might be painted while one is asleep,</q> suggested Mr. Brand, as
a contribution to the discussion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, do paint me while I am asleep,</q> said Gertrude to Felix,
smiling. And she closed her eyes a little. It had by this time become a
matter of almost exciting anxiety to Charlotte what Gertrude would say or
would do next.</p>
            <p>She began to sit for her portrait on the following day—in the open
air, on the north side of the piazza. <q>I wish you would tell me what you
think of us—how we seem to you,</q> she said to Felix, as he sat
before his easel.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You seem to me the best people in the world,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You say that,</q> Gertrude resumed, <q>because it saves you the
trouble of saying anything else.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young man glanced at her over the top of his canvas. <q>What else
should I say? It would certainly be a great deal of trouble to say anything
different.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> said Gertrude, <q>you have seen people before that you have
liked, have you not?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Indeed I have, thank Heaven!</q>
               <pb n="934"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And they have been very different from us,</q> Gertrude
went on.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That only proves,</q> said Felix, <q>that there are a thousand
different ways of being good company.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you think us good company?</q> asked Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Company for a king!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude was silent a moment; and then, <q>There must be a thousand
different ways of being dreary,</q> she said; <q>and sometimes I think we
make use of them all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix stood up quickly, holding up his hand. <q>If you could only keep
that look on your face for half an hour—while I catch it!</q> he
said. <q>It is uncommonly handsome.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To look handsome for half an hour—that is a great deal to ask
of me,</q> she answered.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It would be the portrait of a young woman who has taken some vow,
some pledge, that she repents of,</q> said Felix, <q>and who is thinking it
over at leisure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have taken no vow, no pledge,</q> said Gertrude, very gravely; <q>I
have nothing to repent of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear cousin, that was only a figure of speech. I am very sure that
no one in your excellent family has anything to repent of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And yet we are always repenting!</q> Gertrude exclaimed. <q>That is
what I mean by our being dreary. You know it perfectly well; you only
pretend that you don't.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix gave a quick laugh. <q>The half hour is going on, and yet you are
handsomer than ever. One must be careful what one says, you see.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To me,</q> said Gertrude, <q>you can say anything.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix looked at her, as an artist might, and painted for some time in
silence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, you seem to me different from your father and sister—from
most of the people you have lived with,</q> he observed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To say that one's self,</q> Gertrude went on, <q>is like
saying—by implication, at least—that one is better. I am not
better; I am much worse. But they say themselves that I am different. It
makes them unhappy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Since you accuse me of concealing my real impressions, <pb n="935"/>
I may admit that I think the tendency—among you
generally—is to be made unhappy too easily.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I wish you would tell that to my father,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It might make him more unhappy!</q> Felix exclaimed, laughing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It certainly would. I don't believe you have seen people like
that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, my dear cousin, how do you know what I have seen?</q> Felix
demanded. <q>How can I tell you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You might tell me a great many things, if you only would. You have
seen people like yourself—people who are bright and gay and fond of
amusement. We are not fond of amusement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes,</q> said Felix, <q>I confess that rather strikes me. You don't
seem to me to get all the pleasure out of life that you might. You don't
seem to me to enjoy. . . . . Do you mind my saying this?</q> he asked,
pausing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Please go on,</q> said the girl, earnestly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You seem to me very well placed for enjoying. You have money and
liberty and what is called in Europe a `position.' But you take a painful
view of life, as one may say.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One ought to think it bright and charming and delightful, eh?</q>
asked Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I should say so—if one can. It is true it all depends upon
that,</q> Felix added.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You know there is a great deal of misery in the world,</q> said his
model.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have seen a little of it,</q> the young man rejoined. <q>But it was
all over there—beyond the sea. I don't see any here. This is a
paradise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude said nothing; she sat looking at the dahlias and the
currant-bushes in the garden, while Felix went on with his work. <q>To
`enjoy,' </q> she began at last, <q>to take life—not painfully, must
one do something wrong?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix gave his long, light laugh again. <q>Seriously, I think not. And
for this reason, among others: you strike me as very capable of enjoying,
if the chance were given you, and yet at the same time as incapable of
wrong-doing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am sure,</q> said Gertrude, <q>that you are very wrong in <pb n="936"/>
telling a person that she is incapable of that. We are never
nearer to evil than when we believe that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are handsomer than ever,</q> observed Felix, irrelevantly.</p>
            <p>Gertrude had got used to hearing him say this. There was not so much
excitement in it as at first. <q>What ought one to do?</q> she continued.
<q>To give parties, to go to the theatre, to read novels, to keep late
hours?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't think it 's what one does or one does n't do that promotes
enjoyment,</q> her companion answered. <q>It is the general way of looking
at life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They look at it as a discipline—that 's what they do here. I
have often been told that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, that 's very good. But there is another way,</q> added Felix,
smiling: <q>to look at it as an opportunity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>An opportunity—yes,</q> said Gertrude. <q>One would get more
pleasure that way.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't attempt to say anything better for it than that it has been
my own way—and that is not saying much!</q> Felix had laid down his
palette and brushes; he was leaning back, with his arms folded, to judge
the effect of his work. <q>And you know,</q> he said, <q>I am a very petty
personage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You have a great deal of talent,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>No—no,</q> the young man rejoined, in a tone of cheerful
impartiality, <q>I have not a great deal of talent. It is nothing at all
remarkable. I assure you I should know if it were. I shall always be
obscure. The world will never hear of me.</q> Gertrude looked at him with a
strange feeling. She was thinking of the great world which he knew and
which she did not, and how full of brilliant talents it must be, since it
could afford to make light of his abilities. <q>You need n't in general
attach much importance to anything I tell you,</q> he pursued; <q>but you
may believe me when I say this,—that I am little better than a
good-natured feather-head.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A feather-head?</q> she repeated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am a species of Bohemian.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A Bohemian?</q> Gertrude had never heard this term before, save as a
geographical denomination; and she quite failed to understand the
figurative meaning which her companion appeared to attach to it. But it
gave her pleasure.<pb n="937"/>
            </p>
            <p>Felix had pushed back his chair and risen to his feet; he
slowly came toward her, smiling. <q>I am a sort of adventurer,</q> he said,
looking down at her.</p>
            <p>She got up, meeting his smile. <q>An adventurer?</q> she repeated. <q>I
should like to hear your adventures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For an instant she believed that he was going to take her hand; but he
dropped his own hands suddenly into the pockets of his painting-jacket.
<q>There is no reason why you should n't,</q> he said. <q>I have been an
adventurer, but my adventures have been very innocent. They have all been
happy ones; I don't think there are any I should n't tell. They were very
pleasant and very pretty; I should like to go over them in memory. Sit down
again, and I will begin,</q> he added in a moment, with his naturally
persuasive smile.</p>
            <p>Gertrude sat down again on that day, and she sat down on several other
days. Felix, while he plied his brush, told her a great many stories, and
she listened with charmed avidity. Her eyes rested upon his lips; she was
very serious; sometimes, from her air of wondering gravity, he thought she
was displeased. But Felix never believed for more than a single moment in
any displeasure of his own producing. This would have been fatuity if the
optimism it expressed had not been much more a hope than a prejudice. It is
beside the matter to say that he had a good conscience; for the best
conscience is a sort of self-reproach, and this young man's brilliantly
healthy nature spent itself in objective good intentions which were
ignorant of any test save exactness in hitting their mark. He told Gertrude
how he had walked over France and Italy with a painter's knapsack on his
back, paying his way often by knocking off a flattering portrait of his
host or hostess. He told her how he had played the violin in a little band
of musicians—not of high celebrity—who traveled through foreign
lands giving provincial concerts. He told her also how he had been a
momentary ornament of a troupe of strolling actors, engaged in the arduous
task of interpreting Shakespeare to French and German, Polish and Hungarian
audiences.</p>
            <p>While this periodical recital was going on, Gertrude lived in a
fantastic world; she seemed to herself to be reading a romance that came
out in daily numbers. She had known nothing so delightful since the perusal
of <q>Nicholas Nickleby.</q> 
               <pb n="938"/>
One afternoon she went to see her cousin, Mrs. Acton, Robert's
mother, who was a great invalid, never leaving the house. She came back
alone, on foot, across the fields—this being a short way which they
often used. Felix had gone to Boston with her father, who desired to take
the young man to call upon some of his friends, old gentlemen who
remembered his mother—remembered her, but said nothing about
her—and several of whom, with the gentle ladies their wives, had
driven out from town to pay their respects at the little house among the
apple-trees, in vehicles which reminded the Baroness, who received her
visitors with discriminating civility, of the large, light, rattling
barouche in which she herself had made her journey to this neighborhood.
The afternoon was waning; in the western sky the great picture of a New
England sunset, painted in crimson and silver, was suspended from the
zenith; and the stony pastures, as Gertrude traversed them, thinking
intently to herself, were covered with a light, clear glow. At the open
gate of one of the fields she saw from the distance a man's figure; he
stood there as if he were waiting for her, and as she came nearer she
recognized Mr. Brand. She had a feeling as of not having seen him for some
time; she could not have said for how long, for it yet seemed to her that
he had been very lately at the house.</p>
            <p>
               <q>May I walk back with you?</q> he asked. And when she had said that he
might if he wanted, he observed that he had seen her and recognized her
half a mile away.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You must have very good eyes,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, I have very good eyes, Miss Gertrude,</q> said Mr. Brand. She
perceived that he meant something; but for a long time past Mr. Brand had
constantly meant something, and she had almost got used to it. She felt,
however, that what he meant had now a renewed power to disturb her, to
perplex and agitate her. He walked beside her in silence for a moment, and
then he added, <q>I have had no trouble in seeing that you are beginning to
avoid me. But perhaps,</q> he went on, <q>one need n't have had very good
eyes to see that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have not avoided you,</q> said Gertrude, without looking at
him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I think you have been unconscious that you were avoiding <pb n="939"/>
me,</q> Mr. Brand replied. <q>You have not even known that I
was there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, you are here now, Mr. Brand!</q> said Gertrude, with a little
laugh. <q>I know that very well.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He made no rejoinder. He simply walked beside her slowly, as they were
obliged to walk over the soft grass. Presently they came to another gate,
which was closed. Mr. Brand laid his hand upon it, but he made no movement
to open it; he stood and looked at his companion. <q>You are very much
interested—very much absorbed,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>Gertrude glanced at him; she saw that he was pale and that he looked
excited. She had never seen Mr. Brand excited before, and she felt that the
spectacle, if fully carried out, would be impressive, almost painful.
<q>Absorbed in what?</q> she asked. Then she looked away at the illuminated
sky. She felt guilty and uncomfortable, and yet she was vexed with herself
for feeling so. But Mr. Brand, as he stood there looking at her with his
small, kind, persistent eyes, represented an immense body of
half-obliterated obligations, that were rising again into a certain
distinctness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have new interests, new occupations,</q> he went on. <q>I don't
know that I can say that you have new duties. We have always old ones,
Gertrude,</q> he added.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Please open the gate, Mr. Brand,</q> she said; and she felt as if, in
saying so, she were cowardly and petulant. But he opened the gate, and
allowed her to pass; then he closed it behind himself. Before she had time
to turn away he put out his hand and held her an instant by the wrist.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I want to say something to you,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I know what you want to say,</q> she answered. And she was on the
point of adding, <q>And I know just how you will say it;</q> but these
words she kept back.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I love you, Gertrude,</q> he said. <q>I love you very much; I love
you more than ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He said the words just as she had known he would; she had heard them
before. They had no charm for her; she had said to herself before that it
was very strange. It was supposed to be delightful for a woman to listen to
such words; but these seemed to her flat and mechanical. <q>I wish you
would forget that,</q> she declared.<pb n="940"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>How can I—why should I?</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have made you no promise—given you no pledge,</q> she said,
looking at him, with her voice trembling a little.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have let me feel that I have an influence over you. You have
opened your mind to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I never opened my mind to you, Mr. Brand!</q> Gertrude cried, with
some vehemence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Then you were not so frank as I thought—as we all
thought.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't see what any one else had to do with it!</q> cried the
girl.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I mean your father and your sister. You know it makes them happy to
think you will listen to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She gave a little laugh. <q>It does n't make them happy,</q> she said.
<q>Nothing makes them happy. No one is happy here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think your cousin is very happy—Mr. Young,</q> rejoined Mr.
Brand, in a soft, almost timid tone.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So much the better for him!</q> And Gertrude gave her little laugh
again.</p>
            <p>The young man looked at her a moment. <q>You are very much changed,</q>
he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am glad to hear it,</q> Gertrude declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not. I have known you a long time, and I have loved you as you
were.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am much obliged to you,</q> said Gertrude. <q>I must be going
home.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He on his side, gave a little laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You certainly do avoid me—you see!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Avoid me, then,</q> said the girl.</p>
            <p>He looked at her again; and then, very gently,  <q>No I will not avoid
you,</q> he replied; <q>but I will leave you, for the present, to yourself.
I think you will remember—after a while—some of the things you
have forgotten. I think you will come back to me; I have great faith in
that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This time his voice was very touching; there was a strong, reproachful
force in what he said, and Gertrude could answer nothing. He turned away
and stood there, leaning his elbows on the gate and looking at the
beautiful sunset. Gertrude left him and took her way home again; but when
she reached the middle of the next field she suddenly burst into tears. Her<pb n="941"/>
tears seemed to her to have been a long time gathering, and for
some moments it was a kind of glee to shed them. But they presently passed
away. There was something a little hard about Gertrude; and she never wept
again.</p>

            <pb n="942"/>
            <p>Going of an afternoon to call upon his niece, Mr. Wentworth more than
once found Robert Acton sitting in her little drawing-room. This was in no
degree, to Mr. Wentworth, a perturbing fact, for he had no sense of
competing with his young kinsman for Eugenia's good graces. Madame
Münster's uncle had the highest opinion of Robert Acton, who, indeed,
in the family at large, was the object of a great deal of undemonstrative
appreciation. They were all proud of him, in so far as the charge of being
proud may be brought against people who were, habitually, distinctly
guiltless of the misdemeanor known as <q>taking credit.</q> They never
boasted of Robert Acton, nor indulged in vainglorious reference to him;
they never quoted the clever things he had said, nor mentioned the generous
things he had done. But a sort of frigidly-tender faith in his unlimited
goodness was a part of their personal sense of right; and there can,
perhaps, be no better proof of the high esteem in which he was held than
the fact that no explicit judgment was ever passed upon his actions. He was
no more praised than he was blamed; but he was tacitly felt to be an
ornament to his circle. He was the man of the world of the family. He had
been to Chin a and brought home a collection of curiosities; he had made a
fortune—or rather he had quintupled a fortune already considerable;
he was distinguished by that combination of celibacy, <q>property,</q> and
good humor which appeals to even the most subdued imaginations; and it was
taken for granted that he would presently place these advantages at the
disposal of some well-regulated young woman of his own <q>set.</q> Mr.
Wentworth was not a man to admit to himself that—his paternal duties
apart—he liked any individual much better than all other individuals;
but he thought Robert Acton extremely judicious; and this was perhaps as
near an approach as he was capable of to the eagerness of preference, which
his temperament repudiated as it would have disengaged itself from
something slightly unchaste. Acton was, in fact, very judicious—and
something more beside; and indeed it must be claimed for Mr. Wentworth that
in the more illicit parts of <pb n="943"/>
his preference there hovered the vague adumbration of a belief
that his cousin's fin al merit was a certain enviable capacity for
whistling, rather gallantly, at the sanctions of mere judgment—for
showing a larger courage, a finer quality of pluck, than common occasion
demanded. Mr. Wentworth would never have risked the intimation that Acton
was made, in the smallest degree, of the stuff of a hero; but this is small
blame to him, for Robert would certainly never have risked it himself.
Acton certainly exercised great discretion in all things—beginning
with his estimate of himself. He knew that he was by no means so much of a
man of the world as he was supposed to be in local circles; but it must be
added that he knew also that his natural shrewdness had a reach of which he
had never quite given local circles the measure. He was addicted to taking
the humorous view of things, and he had discovered that even in the
narrowest circles such a disposition may find frequent opportunities. Such
opportunities had formed for some time—that is, since his return from
Chin a, a year and a half before—the most active element in this
gentleman's life, which had just now a rather indolent air. He was
perfectly willing to get married. He was very fond of books, and he had a
handsome library; that is, his books were much more numerous than Mr.
Wentworth's. He was also very fond of pictures; but it must be confessed,
in the fierce light of contemporary criticism, that his walls were adorned
with several rather abortive masterpieces. He had got his
learning—and there was more of it than commonly appeared—at
Harvard College; and he took a pleasure in old associations, which made it
a part of his daily contentment to live so near this institution that he
often passed it in driving to Boston. He was extremely interested in the
Baroness Münster.</p>
            <p>She was very frank with him; or at least she intended to be. <q>I am
sure you find it very strange that I should have settled down in this
out-of-the-way part of the world!</q> she said to him three or four weeks
after she had installed herself. <q>I am certain you are wondering about my
motives. They are very pure.</q> The Baroness by this time was an old
inhabitant; the best society in Boston had called upon her, and Clifford
Wentworth had taken her several times to drive in his buggy.</p>
            <p>Robert Acton was seated near her, playing with a fan; there <pb n="944"/>
were always several fans lying about her drawing-room, with
long ribbons of different colors attached to them, and Acton was always
playing with one. <q>No, I don't find it at all strange,</q> he said
slowly, smiling. <q>That a clever woman should turn up in Boston, or its
suburbs—that does not require so much explanation. Boston is a very
nice place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If you wish to make me contradict you,</q> said the Baroness, <q>vous
vous y prenez mal. In certain moods there is nothing I am not capable of
agreeing to. Boston is a paradise, and we are in the suburbs of
Paradise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Just now I am not at all in the suburbs; I am in the place
itself,</q> rejoined Acton, who was lounging a little in his chair. He was,
however, not always lounging; and when he was he was not quite so relaxed
as he pretended. To a certain extent, he sought refuge from shyness in this
appearance of relaxation; and like many persons in the same circumstances
he somewhat exaggerated the appearance. Beyond this, the air of being much
at his ease was a cover for vigilant observation. He was more than
interested in this clever woman, who, whatever he might say, was clever not
at all after the Boston fashion; she plunged him into a kind of excitement,
held him in vague suspense. He was obliged to admit to himself that he had
never yet seen a woman just like this—not even in Chin a. He was
ashamed, for inscrutable reasons, of the vivacity of his emotion, and he
carried it off, superficially, by taking, still superficially, the humorous
view of Madame Münster. It was not at all true that he thought it very
natural of her to have made this pious pilgrimage. It might have been said
of him in advance that he was too good a Bostonian to regard in the light
of an eccentricity the desire of even the remotest alien to visit the New
England metropolis. This was an impulse for which, surely, no apology was
needed; and Madame Münster was the fortunate possessor of several New
England cousins. In fact, however, Madame Münster struck him as out of
keeping with her little circle; she was at the best a very agreeable, a
gracefully mystifying anomaly. He knew very well that it would not do to
address these reflections too crudely to Mr. Wentworth; he would never have
remarked to the old gentleman that he wondered what the Baroness was up to.
And indeed he had no great desire to share his vague <pb n="945"/>
mistrust with any one. There was a personal pleasure in it; the
greatest pleasure he had known at least since he had come from Chin a. He
would keep the Baroness, for better or worse, to himself; he had a feeling
that he deserved to enjoy a monopoly of her, for he was certainly the
person who had most adequately gauged her capacity for social intercourse.
Before long it became apparent to him that the Baroness was disposed to lay
no tax upon such a monopoly.</p>
            <p>One day (he was sitting there again and playing with a fan) she asked
him to apologize, should the occasion present itself, to certain people in
Boston for her not having returned their calls. <q>There are half a dozen
places,</q> she said; <q>a formidable list. Charlotte Wentworth has written
it out for me, in a terrifically distinct hand. There is no ambiguity on
the subject; I know perfectly where I must go. Mr. Wentworth informs me
that the carriage is always at my disposal, and Charlotte offers to go with
me, in a pair of tight gloves and a very stiff petticoat. And yet for three
days I have been putting it off. They must think me horribly
vicious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You ask me to apologize,</q> said Acton, <q>but you don't tell me
what excuse I can offer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is more,</q> the Baroness declared, <q>than I am held to. It
would be like my asking you to buy me a bouquet and giving you the money. I
have no reason except that—somehow—it 's too violent an effort.
It is not inspiring. Would n't that serve as an excuse, in Boston? I am
told they are very sincere; they don't tell fibs. And then Felix ought to
go with me, and he is never in readiness. I don't see him. He is always
roaming about the fields and sketching old barns, or taking ten-mile walks,
or painting some one's portrait, or rowing on the pond, or flirting with
Gertrude Wentworth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people,</q>
said Acton. <q>You are having a very quiet time of it here. It 's a dull
life for you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, the quiet,—the quiet!</q> the Baroness  exclaimed. <q>That
's what I like. It 's rest. That 's what I came here for. Amusement? I have
had amusement. And as for seeing people—I have already seen a great
many in my life. If it did n't sound ungracious I should say that I wish
very humbly your people here would leave me alone!</q>
               <pb n="946"/>
            </p>
            <p>Acton looked at her a moment, and she looked at him. She was
a woman who took being looked at remarkably well. <q>So you have come here
for rest?</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So I may say. I came for many of those reasons that are no
reasons—don't you know?—and yet that are really the best: to
come away, to change, to break with everything. When once one comes away
one must arrive somewhere, and I asked myself why I should n't arrive
here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You certainly had time on the way!</q> said Acton, laughing.</p>
            <p>Madame Münster looked at him again; and then, smiling: <q>And I
have certainly had time, since I got here, to ask myself why I came.
However, I never ask myself idle questions. Here I am, and it seems to me
you ought only to thank me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When you go away you will see the difficulties I shall put in your
path.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You mean to put difficulties in my path?</q> she asked, rearranging
the rosebud in her corsage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The greatest of all—that of having been so
agreeable</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>That I shall be unable to depart? Don't be too sure. I have left some
very agreeable people over there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah,</q> said Acton, <q>but it was to come here, where I am!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I did n't know of your existence. Excuse me for saying anything so
rude; but, honestly speaking, I did not. No,</q> the Baroness pursued,
<q>it was precisely not to see you—such people as you—that I
came.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Such people as me?</q> cried Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which I
knew I should find here. Over there I had only, as I may say, artificial
relations. Don't you see the difference?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The difference tells against me,</q> said Acton. <q>I suppose I am an
artificial relation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Conventional,</q> declared the Baroness; <q>very
conventional.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, there is one way in which the relation of a lady and a
gentleman may always become natural,</q> said Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You mean by their becoming lovers? That may be natural or not. And at
any rate,</q> rejoined Eugenia, <q>nous n'en sommes pas là!</q>
            </p>
            <p>They were not, as yet; but a little later, when she began to go with him
to drive, it might almost have seemed that they <pb n="947"/>
were. He came for her several times, alone, in his high
<q>wagon,</q> drawn by a pair of charming light-limbed horses. It was
different, her having gone with Clifford Wentworth, who was her cousin, and
so much younger. It was not to be imagined that she should have a
flirtation with Clifford, who was a mere shame-faced boy, and whom a large
section of Boston society supposed to be <q>engaged</q> to Lizzie Acton.
Not, indeed, that it was to be conceived that the Baroness was a possible
party to any flirtation whatever; for she was undoubtedly a married lady.
It was generally known that her matrimonial condition was of the
<q>morganatic</q> order; but in its natural aversion to suppose that this
meant anything less than absolute wedlock, the conscience of the community
took refuge in the belief that it implied something even more.</p>
            <p>Acton wished her to think highly of American scenery, and he drove her
to great distances, picking out the prettiest roads and the largest points
of view. If we are good when we are contented, Eugenia's virtues should now
certainly have been uppermost; for she found a charm in the rapid movement
through a wild country, and in a companion who from time to time made the
vehicle dip, with a motion like a swallow's flight, over roads of primitive
construction, and who, as she felt, would do a great many things that she
might ask him. Sometimes, for a couple of hours together, there were almost
no houses; there were nothing but woods and rivers and lakes and horizons
adorned with bright-looking mountains. It seemed to the Baroness very wild,
as I have said, and lovely; but the impression added something to that
sense of the enlargement of opportunity which had been born of her arrival
in the New World.</p>
            <p>One day—it was late in the afternoon—Acton pulled up his
horses on the crest of a hill which commanded a beautiful prospect. He let
them stand a long time to rest, while he sat there and talked with Madame
Münster. The prospect was beautiful in spite of there being nothing
human within sight. There was a wilderness of woods, and the gleam of a
distant river, and a glimpse of half the hill-tops in Massachusetts. The
road had a wide, grassy margin, on the further side of which there flowed a
deep, clear brook; there were wild flowers in the grass, and beside the
brook lay the trunk of a fallen tree. <pb n="948"/>
Acton waited a while; at last a rustic wayfarer came trudging
along the road. Acton asked him to hold the horses—a service he
consented to render, as a friendly turn to a fellow-citizen. Then he
invited the Baroness to descend, and the two wandered away, across the
grass, and sat down on the log beside the brook.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I imagine it does n't remind you of Silberstadt,</q> said Acton. It
was the first time that he had mentioned Silberstadt to her, for particular
reasons. He knew she had a husband there, and this was disagreeable to him;
and, furthermore, it had been repeated to him that this husband wished to
put her away—a state of affairs to which even indirect reference was
to be deprecated. It was true, nevertheless, that the Baroness herself had
often alluded to Silberstadt; and Acton had often wondered why her husband
wished to get rid of her. It was a curious position for a lady—this
being known as a repudiated wife; and it is worthy of observation that the
Baroness carried it off with exceeding grace and dignity. She had made it
felt, from the first, that there were two sides to the question, and that
her own side, when she should choose to present it, would be replete with
touching interest.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It does not remind me of the town, of course,</q> she said, <q>of the
sculptured gables and the Gothic churches, of the wonderful Schloss, with
its moat and its clustering towers. But it has a little look of some other
parts of the principality. One might fancy one's self among those grand old
German forests, those legendary mountains; the sort of country one sees
from the windows at Shreckenstein.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What is Shreckenstein?</q> asked Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is a great castle,—the summer residence of the Reigning
Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Have you ever lived there?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have stayed there,</q> said the Baroness. Acton was silent; he
looked a while at the uncastled landscape before him. <q>It is the first
time you have ever asked me about Silberstadt,</q> she said. <q>I should
think you would want to know about my marriage; it must seem to you very
strange.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton looked at her a moment. <q>Now you would n't like me to say
that!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You Americans have such odd ways!</q> the Baroness declared. <pb n="949"/>
               <q>You never ask anything outright; there seem to be so many
things you can't talk about.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We Americans are very polite,</q> said Acton, whose national
consciousness had been complicated by a residence in foreign lands, and who
yet disliked to hear Americans abused. <q>We don't like to tread upon
people's toes,</q> he said. <q>But I should like very much to hear about
your marriage. Now tell me how it came about.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Prince fell in love with me,</q> replied the Baroness simply.
<q>He pressed his suit very hard. At first he did n't wish me to marry him;
on the contrary. But on that basis I refused to listen to him. So he
offered me marriage—in so far as he might. I was young, and I confess
I was rather flattered. But if it were to be done again now, I certainly
should not accept him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>How long ago was this?</q> asked Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh—several years,</q> said Eugenia. <q>You should never ask a
woman for dates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why, I should think that when a woman was relating history</q> . . .
. Acton answered. <q>And now he wants to break it off?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They want him to make a political marriage. It is his brother's idea.
His brother is very clever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They must be a precious pair!</q> cried Robert Acton.</p>
            <p>The Baroness gave a little philosophic shrug. <q>Que voulez-vous? They
are princes. They think they are treating me very well. Silberstadt is a
perfectly despotic little state, and the Reigning Prince may annul the
marriage by a stroke of his pen. But he has promised me, nevertheless, not
to do so without my formal consent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And this you have refused?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hitherto. It is an indignity, and I have wished  at least to make it
difficult for them. But I have a little document in my writing-desk which I
have only to sign and send back to the Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Then it will be all over?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness lifted her hand, and dropped it again. <q>Of course I shall
keep my title; at least, I shall be at liberty to keep it if I choose. And
I suppose I shall keep it. One must have a name. And I shall keep my
pension. It is very small—it is wretchedly small; but it is what I
live on.</q>
               <pb n="950"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And you have only to sign that paper?</q> Acton
asked.</p>
            <p>The Baroness looked at him a moment. <q>Do you urge it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>He got up slowly, and stood with his hands in his pockets. <q>What do
you gain by not doing it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am supposed to gain this advantage—that if I delay, or
temporize, the Prince may come back to me, may make a stand against his
brother. He is very fond of me, and his brother has pushed him only little
by little.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If he were to come back to you,</q> said Acton, <q>would
you—would you take him back?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness met his eyes; she colored just a little. Then she rose.
<q>I should have the satisfaction of saying, `Now it is my turn. I break
with your serene highness!' </q>
            </p>
            <p>They began to walk toward the carriage. <q>Well,</q> said Robert Acton,
<q>it 's a curious story! How did you make his acquaintance?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I was staying with an old lady—an old Countess—in
Dresden. She had been a friend of my father's. My father was dead; I was
very much alone. My brother was wandering about the world in a theatrical
troupe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your brother ought to have stayed with you,</q> Acton observed,
<q>and kept you from putting your trust in princes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness was silent a moment, and then, <q>He did what he could,</q>
she said. <q>He sent me money. The old Countess encouraged the Prince; she
was even pressing. It seems to me,</q> Madame Münster added, gently,
<q>that—under the circumstances—I behaved very well.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton glanced at her, and made the observation—he had made it
before—that a woman looks the prettier for having unfolded her wrongs
or her sufferings. <q>Well,</q> he reflected, audibly, <q>I should like to
see you send his serene highness—somewhere!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madame Münster stooped and plucked a daisy from the grass. <q>And
not sign my renunciation?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I don't know—I don't know,</q> said Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In one case I should have my revenge; in another case I should have
my liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton gave a little laugh as he helped her into the carriage. <q>At any
rate,</q> he said, <q>take good care of that paper.</q>
               <pb n="951"/>
            </p>
            <p>A couple of days afterward he asked her to come and see his
house. The visit had already been proposed, but it had been put off in
consequence of his mother's illness. She was a constant invalid, and she
had passed these recent years, very patiently, in a great flowered
arm-chair at her bedroom window. Lately, for some days, she had been unable
to see any one; but now she was better, and she sent the Baroness a very
civil message. Acton had wished their visitor to come to dinner; but Madame
Münster preferred to begin with a simple call. She had reflected that
if she should go to dinner Mr. Wentworth and his daughters would also be
asked, and it had seemed to her that the peculiar character of the occasion
would be best preserved in a tête-à-tête with her host.
Why the occasion should have a peculiar character she explained to no one.
As far as any one could see, it was simply very pleasant. Acton came for
her and drove her to his door, an operation which was rapidly performed.
His house the Baroness mentally pronounced a very good one; more
articulately, she declared that it was enchanting. It was large and square
and painted brown; it stood in a well-kept shrubbery, and was approached,
from the gate, by a short drive. It was, moreover, a much more modern
dwelling than Mr. Wentworth's, and was more redundantly upholstered and
expensively ornamented. The Baroness perceived that her entertainer had
analyzed material comfort to a sufficiently fine point. And then he
possessed the most delightful chinoiseries—trophies of his sojourn in
the Celestial Empire: pagodas of ebony and cabinets of ivory; sculptured
monsters, grinning and leering on chimney-pieces, in front of beautifully
figured hand-screens; porcelain dinner-sets, gleaming behind the glass
doors of mahogany buffets; large screens, in corners, covered with tense
silk and embroidered with mandarins and dragons. These things were
scattered all over the house, and they gave Eugenia a pretext for a
complete domiciliary visit. She liked it, she enjoyed it; she thought it a
very nice place. It had a mixture of the homely and the liberal, and though
it was almost a museum, the large, little-used rooms were as fresh and
clean as a well-kept dairy. Lizzie Acton told her that she dusted all the
pagodas and other curiosities every day with her own hands; and the
Baroness answered that she was evidently a <pb n="952"/>
household fairy. Lizzie had not at all the look of a young lady
who dusted things; she wore such pretty dresses and had such delicate
fingers that it was difficult to imagine her immersed in sordid cares. She
came to meet Madame Münster on her arrival, but she said nothing, or
almost nothing, and the Baroness again reflected—she had had occasion
to do so before—that American girls had no manners. She disliked this
little American girl, and she was quite prepared to learn that she had
failed to commend herself to Miss Acton. Lizzie struck her as positive and
explicit almost to pertness; and the idea of her combining the apparent
incongruities of a taste for housework and the wearing of fresh,
Parisian-looking dresses suggested the possession of a dangerous energy. It
was a source of irritation to the Baroness that in this country it should
seem to matter whether a little girl were a trifle less or a trifle more of
a nonentity; for Eugenia had hitherto been conscious of no moral pressure
as regards the appreciation of diminutive virgins. It was perhaps an
indication of Lizzie's pertness that she very soon retired and left the
Baroness on her brother's hands. Acton talked a great deal about his
chinoiseries; he knew a good deal about porcelain and bric-a-brac. The
Baroness, in her progress through the house, made, as it were, a great many
stations. She sat down everywhere, confessed to being a little tired, and
asked about the various objects with a curious mixture of alertness and in
attention. If there had been any one to say it to she would have declared
that she was positively in love with her host; but she could hardly make
this declaration—even in the strictest confidence—to Acton
himself. It gave her, nevertheless, a pleasure that had some of the charm
of unwontedness to feel, with that admirable keenness with which she was
capable of feeling things, that he had a disposition without any edges;
that even his humorous irony always expanded toward the point. One's
impression of his honesty was almost like carrying a bunch of flowers; the
perfume was most agreeable, but they were occasionally an inconvenience.
One could trust him, at any rate, round all the corners of the world; and,
withal, he was not absolutely simple, which would have been excess; he was
only relatively simple, which was quite enough for the Baroness.</p>
            <p>Lizzie reappeared to say that her mother would now be <pb n="953"/>
happy to receive Madame Münster; and the Baroness followed
her to Mrs. Acton's apartment. Eugenia reflected, as she went, that it was
not the affectation of impertinence that made her dislike this young lady,
for on that ground she could easily have beaten her. It was not an
aspiration on the girl's part to rivalry, but a kind of laughing,
childishly-mocking indifference to the results of comparison. Mrs. Acton
was an emaciated, sweet-faced woman of five and fifty, sitting with pillows
behind her, and looking out on a clump of hemlocks. She was very modest,
very timid, and very ill; she made Eugenia feel grateful that she herself
was not like that—neither so ill, nor, possibly, so modest. On a
chair, beside her, lay a volume of Emerson's Essays. It was a great
occasion for poor Mrs. Acton, in her helpless condition, to be confronted
with a clever foreign lady, who had more manner than any lady—any
dozen ladies—that she had ever seen.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have heard a great deal about you,</q> she said, softly, to the
Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>From your son, eh?</q> Eugenia asked. <q>He has talked to me
immensely of you. Oh, he talks of you as you would like,</q> the Baroness
declared; <q>as such a son must talk of such a mother!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Acton sat gazing; this was part of Madame Münster's
<q>manner.</q> But Robert Acton was gazing too, in vivid consciousness that
he had barely mentioned his mother to their brilliant guest. He never
talked of this still maternal presence,—a presence refined to such
delicacy that it had almost resolved itself, with him, simply into the
subjective emotion of gratitude. And Acton rarely talked of his emotions.
The Baroness turned her smile toward him, and she instantly felt that she
had been observed to be fibbing. She had struck a false note. But who were
these people to whom such fibbing was not pleasing? If they were annoyed,
the Baroness was equally so; and after the exchange of a few civil
inquiries and low-voiced responses she took leave of Mrs. Acton. She begged
Robert not to come home with her; she would get into the carriage alone;
she preferred that. This was imperious, and she thought he looked
disappointed. While she stood before the door with him—the carriage
was turning in the gravel-walk—this thought restored her
serenity.<pb n="954"/>
            </p>
            <p>When she had given him her hand in farewell she looked at
him a moment. <q>I have almost decided to dispatch that paper,</q> she
said.</p>
            <p>He knew that she alluded to the document that she had called her
renunciation; and he assisted her into the carriage without saying
anything. But just before the vehicle began to move he said, <q>Well, when
you have in fact dispatched it, I hope you will let me know!</q>

            <pb n="955"/>
            <p>Felix young finished Gertrude's portrait, and he afterwards transferred
to canvas the features of many members of that circle of which it may be
said that he had become for the time the pivot and the centre. I am afraid
it must be confessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter, and that
he imparted to his models a romantic grace which seemed easily and cheaply
acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man who made
<q>sitting</q> so entertaining. For Felix was paid for his pictures,
making, as he did, no secret of the fact that in guiding his steps to the
Western world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand with a desire to
better his condition. He took his uncle's portrait quite as if Mr.
Wentworth had never averted himself from the experiment; and as he
compassed his end only by the exercise of gentle violence, it is but fair
to add that he allowed the old man to give him nothing but his time. He
passed his arm into Mr. Wentworth's one summer morning—very few arms
indeed had ever passed into Mr. Wentworth's—and led him across the
garden and along the road into the studio which he had extemporized in the
little house among the apple-trees. The grave gentleman felt himself more
and more fascinated by his clever nephew, whose fresh, demonstrative youth
seemed a compendium of experiences so strangely numerous. It appeared to
him that Felix must know a great deal; he would like to learn what he
thought about some of those things as regards which his own conversation
had always been formal, but his knowledge vague. Felix had a confident,
gayly trenchant way of judging human actions which Mr. Wentworth grew
little by little to envy; it seemed like criticism made easy. Forming an
opinion—say on a person's conduct—was, with Mr. Wentworth, a
good deal like fumbling in a lock with a key chosen at hazard. He seemed to
himself to go about the world with a big bunch of these ineffectual
instruments at his girdle. His nephew, on the other hand, with a single
turn of the wrist, opened any door as adroitly as a horse-thief. He felt
obliged to keep up the convention that an uncle is always wiser than a
nephew, even if he could keep it up no otherwise <pb n="956"/>
than by listening in serious silence to Felix's quick, light,
constant discourse. But there came a day when he lapsed from consistency
and almost asked his nephew's advice.  </p>
            <p>
               <q>Have you ever entertained the idea of settling in the United
States?</q> he asked one morning, while Felix brilliantly plied his
brush.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear uncle,</q> said Felix, <q>excuse me if your question makes me
smile a little. To begin with, I have never entertained an idea. Ideas
often entertain me; but I am afraid I have never seriously made a plan. I
know what you are going to say; or rather, I know what you think, for I
don't think you will say it—that this is very frivolous and
loose-minded on my part. So it is; but I am made like that; I take things
as they come, and somehow there is always some new thing to follow the
last. In the second place, I should never propose to settle. I can't
settle, my dear uncle; I 'm not a settler. I know that is what strangers
are supposed to do here; they always settle. But I have n't—to answer
your question—entertained that idea.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You intend to return to Europe and resume your irregular manner of
life?</q> Mr. Wentworth inquired.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I can't say I intend. But it 's very likely I shall go back to
Europe. After all, I am a European. I feel that, you know. It will depend a
good deal upon my sister. She 's even more of a European than I; here, you
know, she 's a picture out of her setting. And as for `resuming,' dear
uncle, I really have never given up my irregular manner of life. What, for
me, could be more irregular than this?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Than what?</q> asked Mr. Wentworth, with his pale gravity.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, than everything! Living in the midst of you, this way; this
charming, quiet, serious family life; fraternizing with Charlotte and
Gertrude; calling upon twenty young ladies and going out to walk with them;
sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and listening to the
crickets, and going to bed at ten o'clock.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your description is very animated,</q> said Mr. Wentworth; <q>but I
see nothing improper in what you describe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Neither do I, dear uncle. It is extremely delightful; I should n't
like it if it were improper. I assure you I don't like <pb n="957"/>
improper things; though I dare say you think I do,</q> Felix
went on, painting away.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have never accused you of that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Pray don't,</q> said Felix, <q>because, you see, at bottom I am a
terrible Philistine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A Philistine?</q> repeated Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I mean, as one may say, a plain, God-fearing man.</q> Mr. Wentworth
looked at him reservedly, like a mystified sage, and Felix continued, <q>I
trust I shall enjoy a venerable and venerated old age. I mean to live long.
I can hardly call that a plan, perhaps; but it 's a keen desire—a
rosy vision. I shall be a lively, perhaps even a frivolous old man!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is natural,</q> said his uncle, sententiously, <q>that one should
desire to prolong an agreeable life. We have perhaps a selfish
indisposition to bring our pleasure to a close. But I presume,</q> he
added, <q>that you expect to marry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That too, dear uncle, is a hope, a desire, a vision,</q> said Felix.
It occurred to him for an instant that this was possibly a preface to the
offer of the hand of one of Mr. Wentworth's admirable daughters. But in the
name of decent modesty and a proper sense of the hard realities of this
world, Felix banished the thought. His uncle was the incarnation of
benevolence, certainly; but from that to accepting—much more
postulating—the idea of a union between a young lady with a dowry
presumptively brilliant and a penniless artist with no prospect of fame,
there was a very long way. Felix had lately become conscious of a luxurious
preference for the society—if possible unshared with others—of
Gertrude Wentworth; but he had relegated this young lady, for the moment,
to the coldly brilliant category of unattainable possessions. She was not
the first woman for whom he had entertained an unpractical admiration. He
had been in love with duchesses and countesses, and he had made, once or
twice, a perilously near approach to cynicism in declaring that the
disinterestedness of women had been overrated. On the whole, he had
tempered audacity with modesty; and it is but fair to him now to say
explicitly that he would have been incapable of taking advantage of his
present large allowance of familiarity to make love to the younger of his
handsome cousins. Felix had <pb n="958"/>
grown up among traditions in the light of which such a
proceeding looked like a grievous breach of hospitality. I have said that
he was always happy, and it may be counted among the present sources of his
happiness that he had as regards this matter of his relations with Gertrude
a deliciously good conscience. His own deportment seemed to him suffused
with the beauty of virtue—a form of beauty that he admired with the
same vivacity with which he admired all other forms.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I think that if you marry,</q> said Mr. Wentworth presently, <q>it
will conduce to your happiness.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sicurissimo!</q> Felix exclaimed; and then, arresting his brush, he
looked at his uncle with a smile. <q>There is something I feel tempted to
say to you. May I risk it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth drew himself up a little. <q>I am very safe; I don't
repeat things.</q> But he hoped Felix would not risk too much.</p>
            <p>Felix was laughing at his answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's odd to hear you telling me how to be happy. I don't think you
know yourself, dear uncle. Now, does that sound brutal?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The old man was silent a moment, and then, with a dry dignity that
suddenly touched his nephew: <q>We may sometimes point out a road we are
unable to follow.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, don't tell me you have had any sorrows,</q> Felix rejoined. <q>I
did n't suppose it, and I did n't mean to allude to them. I simply meant
that you all don't amuse yourselves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Amuse ourselves? We are not children.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Precisely not! You have reached the proper age. I was saying that the
other day to Gertrude,</q> Felix added. <q>I hope it was not
indiscreet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I fit was,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, with a keener irony than Felix
would have thought him capable of, <q>it was but your way of amusing
yourself. I am afraid you have never had a trouble.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, yes, I have!</q> Felix declared, with some spirit; <q>before I
knew better. But you don't catch me at it again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a
deep-drawn sigh. <q>You have no children,</q> he said at last.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't tell me,</q> Felix exclaimed, <q>that your charming young
people are a source of grief to you!</q>
               <pb n="959"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't speak of Charlotte.</q> And then, after a pause,
Mr. Wentworth continued, <q>I don't speak of Gertrude. But I feel
considerable anxiety about Clifford. I will tell you another time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next time he gave Felix a sitting his nephew reminded him that he
had taken him into his confidence. <q>How is Clifford to-day?</q> Felix
asked. <q>He has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable discretion.
Indeed, he is only too discreet; he seems on his guard against me—as
if he thought me rather light company. The other day he told his
sister—Gertrude repeated it to me—that I was always laughing at
him. If I laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him with
confidence. That is the only way I have.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Clifford's situation is no laughing matter,</q> said Mr. Wentworth.
<q>It is very peculiar, as I suppose you have guessed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, you mean his love affair with his cousin?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth stared, blushing a little. <q>I mean his absence from
college. He has been suspended. We have decided not to speak of it unless
we are asked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Suspended?</q> Felix repeated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He has been requested by the Harvard authorities to absent himself
for six months. Meanwhile he is studying with Mr. Brand. We think Mr. Brand
will help him; at least we hope so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What befell him at college?</q> Felix asked. <q>He was too fond of
pleasure? Mr. Brand certainly will not teach him any of those
secrets!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond. I
suppose it is considered a pleasure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix gave his light laugh. <q>My dear uncle, is there any doubt about
its being a pleasure? C'est de son âge, as they say in
France.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should have said rather it was a vice of later life—of
disappointed old age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix glanced at his uncle, with his lifted eyebrows, and then, <q>Of
what are you speaking?</q> he demanded, smiling.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Of the situation in which Clifford was found.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, he was found—he was caught?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Necessarily, he was caught. He could n't walk; he
staggered.</q>
               <pb n="960"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh,</q> said Felix, <q>he drinks! I rather suspected
that, from something I observed the first day I came here. I quite agree
with you that it is a low taste. It 's not a vice for a gentleman. He ought
to give it up.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We hope for a good deal from Mr. Brand's influence,</q> Mr. Wentworth
went on. <q>He has talked to him from the first. And he never touches
anything himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I will talk to him—I will talk to him!</q> Felix declared,
gayly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What will you say to him?</q> asked his uncle, with some
apprehension.</p>
            <p>Felix for some moments answered nothing. <q>Do you mean to marry him to
his cousin?</q> he asked at last.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Marry him?</q> echoed Mr. Wentworth. <q>I should n't think his cousin
would want to marry him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You have no understanding, then, with Mrs. Acton?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth stared, almost blankly. <q>I have never discussed such
subjects with her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should think it might be time,</q> said Felix. <q>Lizzie Acton is
admirably pretty, and if Clifford is dangerous . . . .</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They are not engaged,</q> said Mr. Wentworth. <q>I have no reason to
suppose they are engaged.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Par exemple!</q> cried Felix. <q>A clandestine engagement? Trust me,
Clifford, as I say, is a charming boy. He is incapable of that. Lizzie
Acton, then, would not be jealous of another woman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I certainly hope not,</q> said the old man, with a vague sense of
jealousy being an even lower vice than a love of liquor.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The best thing for Clifford, then,</q> Felix propounded, <q>is to
become interested in some clever, charming woman.</q> And he paused in his
painting, and, with his elbows on his knees, looked with bright
communicativeness at his uncle. <q>You see, I believe greatly in the
influence of women. Living with women helps to make a man a gentleman. It
is very true Clifford has his sisters, who are so charming. But there
should be a different sentiment in play from the fraternal, you know. He
has Lizzie Acton; but she, perhaps, is rather immature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I suspect Lizzie has talked to him, reasoned with him,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>On the impropriety of getting tipsy—on the beauty of <pb n="961"/>
temperance? That is dreary work for a pretty young girl.
No,</q> Felix continued; <q>Clifford ought to frequent some agreeable
woman, who, without ever mentioning such unsavory subjects, would give him
a sense of its being very ridiculous to be fuddled. If he could fall in
love with her a little, so much the better. The thing would operate as a
cure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, now, what lady should you suggest?</q> asked Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is a clever woman under your hand. My sister.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your sister—under my hand?</q> Mr. Wentworth repeated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Say a word to Clifford. Tell him to be bold. He is well disposed
already; he has invited her two or three times to drive. But I don't think
he comes to see her. Give him a hint to come—to come often. He will
sit there of an afternoon, and they will talk. It will do him good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth meditated. <q>You think she will exercise a helpful
influence?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She will exercise a civilizing—I may call it a
sobering—influence. A charming, clever, witty woman always
does—especially if she is a little of a coquette. My dear uncle, the
society of such women has been half my education. If Clifford is suspended,
as you say, from college, let Eugenia be his preceptress.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth continued thoughtful. <q>You think Eugenia is a
coquette?</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What pretty woman is not?</q> Felix demanded in turn. But this, for
Mr. Wentworth, could at the best have been no answer, for he did not think
his niece pretty. <q>With Clifford,</q> the young man pursued,<q>Eugenia
will simply be enough of a coquette to be a little ironical. That 's what
he needs. So you recommend him to be nice with her, you know. The
suggestion will come best from you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do I understand,</q> asked the old man, <q>that I am to suggest to my
son to make a—a profession of—of affection to Madame
Münster?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, yes—a profession!</q> cried Felix sympathetically.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But, as I understand it, Madame Münster is a married
woman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah,</q> said Felix, smiling, <q>of course she can't marry him. But
she will do what she can.</q>
               <pb n="962"/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth sat for some time with his eyes on the floor;
at last he got up. <q>I don't think,</q> he said, <q>that I can undertake
to recommend my son any such course.</q> And without meeting Felix's
surprised glance he broke off his sitting, which was not resumed for a
fortnight.</p>
            <p>Felix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of Mr.
Wentworth's numerous acres, and of a remarkable pine grove which lay upon
the further side of it, planted upon a steep embankment and haunted by the
summer breeze. The murmur of the air in the far off tree-tops had a strange
distinctness; it was almost articulate. One afternoon the young man came
out of his painting-room and passed the open door of Eugenia's little
salon. Within, in the cool dimness, he saw his sister, dressed in white,
buried in her arm-chair, and holding to her face an immense bouquet.
Opposite to her sat Clifford Wentworth, twirling his hat. He had evidently
just presented the bouquet to the Baroness, whose fine eyes, as she glanced
at him over the big roses and geraniums, wore a conversational smile.
Felix, standing on the threshold of the cottage, hesitated for a moment as
to whether he should retrace his steps and enter the parlor. Then he went
his way and passed into Mr. Wentworth's garden. That civilizing process to
which he had suggested that Clifford should be subjected appeared to have
come on of itself. Felix was very sure, at least, that Mr. Wentworth had
not adopted his ingenious device for stimulating the young man's æsthetic
consciousness. <q>Doubtless he supposes,</q> he said to himself, after the
conversation that has been narrated, <q>that I desire, out of fraternal
benevolence, to procure for Eugenia the amusement of a flirtation—or,
as he probably calls it, an intrigue—with the too susceptible
Clifford. It must be admitted—and I have noticed it before—that
nothing exceeds the license occasionally taken by the imagination of very
rigid people.</q> Felix, on his own side, had of course said nothing to
Clifford; but he had observed to Eugenia that Mr. Wentworth was much
mortified at his son's low tastes. <q>We ought to do something to help
them, after all their kindness to us,</q> he had added. <q>Encourage
Clifford to come and see you, and inspire him with a taste for
conversation. That will supplant the other, which only comes from his
puerility, from his not <pb n="963"/>
taking his position in the world—that of a rich young man
of ancient stock—seriously enough. Make him a little more serious.
Even if he makes love to you it is no great matter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxication—a
substitute for a brandy bottle, eh?</q> asked the Baroness. <q>Truly, in
this country one comes to strange uses.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But she had not positively declined to undertake Clifford's higher
education, and Felix, who had not thought of the matter again, being
haunted with visions of more personal profit, now reflected that the work
of redemption had fairly begun. The idea in prospect had seemed of the
happiest, but in operation it made him a trifle uneasy. <q>What if
Eugenia—what if Eugenia</q>—he asked himself softly; the
question dying away in his sense of Eugenia's undetermined capacity. But
before Felix had time either to accept or to reject its admonition, even in
this vague form, he saw Robert Acton turn out of Mr. Wentworth's inclosure,
by a distant gate, and come toward the cottage in the orchard. Acton had
evidently walked from his own house along a shady by-way and was intending
to pay a visit to Madame Münster. Felix watched him a moment; then he
turned away. Acton could be left to play the part of Providence and
interrupt—if interruption were needed—Clifford's entanglement
with Eugenia.</p>
            <p>Felix passed through the garden toward the house and toward a postern
gate which opened upon a path leading across the fields, beside a little
wood, to the lake. He stopped and looked up at the house; his eyes rested
more particularly upon a certain open window, on the shady side. Presently
Gertrude appeared there, looking out into the summer light. He took off his
hat to her and bade her good-day; he remarked that he was going to row
across the pond, and begged that she would do him the honor to accompany
him. She looked at him a moment; then, without saying anything, she turned
away. But she soon reappeared below in one of those quaint and charming
Leghorn hats, tied with white satin bows, that were worn at that period;
she also carried a green parasol. She went with him to the edge of the
lake, where a couple of boats were always moored; they got into one of
them, and Felix, with gentle strokes, propelled it to the opposite shore.
The day was the perfection of summer weather; the little lake <pb n="964"/>
was the color of sunshine; the plash of the oars was the only
sound, and they found themselves listening to it. They disembarked, and, by
a winding path, ascended the pine-crested mound which overlooked the water,
whose white expanse glittered between the trees. The place was delightfully
cool, and had the added charm that—in the softly sounding pine
boughs—you seemed to hear the coolness as well as feel it. Felix and
Gertrude sat down on the rust-colored carpet of pine-needles and talked of
many things. Felix spoke at last, in the course of talk, of his going away;
it was the first time he had alluded to it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You are going away?</q> said Gertrude, looking at him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Some day—when the leaves begin to fall. You know I can't stay
forever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude transferred her eyes to the outer prospect, and then, after a
pause, she said, <q>I shall never see you again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why not?</q> asked Felix. <q>We shall probably both survive my
departure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Gertrude only repeated, <q>I shall never see you again. I shall
never hear of you,</q> she went on. <q>I shall know nothing about you. I
knew nothing about you before, and it will be the same again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I knew nothing about you then, unfortunately,</q> said Felix. <q>But
now I shall write to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't write to me. I shall not answer you,</q> Gertrude declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I should of course burn your letters,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at him again. <q>Burn my letters? You sometimes say
strange things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They are not strange in themselves,</q> the young man answered.
<q>They are only strange as said to you. You will come to Europe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>With whom shall I come?</q> She asked this question simply; she was
very much in earnest. Felix was interested in her earnestness; for some
moments he hesitated. <q>You can't tell me that,</q> she pursued. <q>You
can't say that I shall go with my father and my sister; you don't believe
that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall keep your letters,</q> said Felix, presently, for all
answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I never write. I don't know how to write.</q> Gertrude, for <pb n="965"/>
some time, said nothing more; and her companion, as he looked
at her, wished it had not been <q>disloyal</q> to make love to the daughter
of an old gentleman who had offered one hospitality. The afternoon waned;
the shadows stretched themselves; and the light grew deeper in the western
sky. Two persons appeared on the opposite side of the lake, coming from the
house and crossing the meadow. <q>It is Charlotte and Mr. Brand,</q> said
Gertrude. <q>They are coming over here.</q> But Charlotte and Mr. Brand
only came down to the edge of the water, and stood there, looking across;
they made no motion to enter the boat that Felix had left at the
mooring-place. Felix waved his hat to them; it was too far to call. They
made no visible response, and they presently turned away and walked along
the shore.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. Brand is not demonstrative,</q> said Felix. <q>He is never
demonstrative to me. He sits silent, with his chin in his hand, looking at
me. Sometimes he looks away. Your father tells me he is so eloquent; and I
should like to hear him talk. He looks like such a noble young man. But
with me he will never talk. And yet I am so fond of listening to brilliant
imagery!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He is very eloquent,</q> said Gertrude; <q>but he has no brilliant
imagery. I have heard him talk a great deal. I knew that when they saw us
they would not come over here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, he is making la cour, as they say, to your sister? They desire to
be alone?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No,</q> said Gertrude, gravely, <q>they have no such reason as that
for being alone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But why does n't he make la cour to Charlotte?</q> Felix inquired.
<q>She is so pretty, so gentle, so good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude glanced at him, and then she looked at the distantly-seen
couple they were discussing. Mr. Brand and Charlotte were walking side by
side. They might have been a pair of lovers, and yet they might not.
<q>They think I should not be here,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>With me? I thought you did n't have those ideas.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You don't understand. There are a great many things you don't
understand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I understand my stupidity. But why, then, do not Charlotte and Mr.
Brand, who, as an elder sister and a clergyman, are free to walk about
together, come over and make me <pb n="966"/>
wiser by breaking up the unlawful interview into which I have
lured you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is the last thing they would do,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>Felix stared at her a moment, with his lifted eyebrows. <q>Je n'y
comprends rien!</q> he exclaimed; then his eyes followed for a while the
retreating figures of this critical pair. <q>You may say what you
please,</q> he declared; <q>it is evident to me that your sister is not
indifferent to her clever companion. It is agreeable to her to be walking
there with him. I can see that from here.</q> And in the excitement of
observation Felix rose to his feet.</p>
            <p>Gertrude rose also, but she made no attempt to emulate her companion's
discovery; she looked rather in another direction. Felix's words had struck
her; but a certain delicacy checked her. <q>She is certainly not
indifferent to Mr. Brand; she has the highest opinion of him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One can see it—one can see it,</q> said Felix, in a tone of
amused contemplation, with his head on one side. Gertrude turned her back
to the opposite shore; it was disagreeable to her to look, but she hoped
Felix would say something more. <q>Ah, they have wandered away into the
wood,</q> he added.</p>
            <p>Gertrude turned round again. <q>She is not in love with him,</q> she
said; it seemed her duty to say that.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Then he is in love with her; or if he is not, he ought to be. She is
such a perfect little woman of her kind. She reminds me of a pair of
old-fashioned silver sugar-tongs; you know I am very fond of sugar. And she
is very nice with Mr. Brand; I have noticed that; very gentle and
gracious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude reflected a moment. Then she took a great resolution. <q>She
wants him to marry me,</q> she said. <q>So of course she is nice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix's eyebrows rose higher than ever. <q>To marry you! Ah, ah, this is
interesting. And you think one must be very nice with a man to induce him
to do that?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude had turned a little pale, but she went on, <q>Mr. Brand wants
it himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix folded his arms and stood looking at her. <q>I see—I
see,</q> he said quickly. <q>Why did you never tell me this
before?</q>
               <pb n="967"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is disagreeable to me to speak of it even now. I
wished simply to explain to you about Charlotte.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You don't wish to marry Mr. Brand, then?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No,</q> said Gertrude, gravely.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And does your father wish it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Very much.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And you don't like him—you have refused him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't wish to marry him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your father and sister think you ought to, eh?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is a long story,</q> said Gertrude. <q>They think there are good
reasons. I can't explain it. They think I have obligations, and that I have
encouraged him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix smiled at her, as if she had been telling him an amusing story
about some one else. <q>I can't tell you how this interests me,</q> he
said. <q>Now you don't recognize these reasons—these
obligations?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not sure; it is not easy.</q> And she picked up her parasol and
turned away, as if to descend the slope.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Tell me this,</q> Felix went on, going with her: <q>are you likely to
give in—to let them persuade you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at him with the serious face that she had constantly
worn, in opposition to his almost eager smile. <q>I shall never marry Mr.
Brand,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I see!</q> Felix rejoined. And they slowly descended the hill
together, saying nothing till they reached the margin of the pond. <q>It is
your own affair,</q> he then resumed; <q>but do you know, I am not
altogether glad? If it were settled that you were to marry Mr. Brand I
should take a certain comfort in the arrangement. I should feel more free.
I have no right to make love to you myself, eh?</q> And he paused, lightly
pressing his argument upon her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>None whatever,</q> replied Gertrude quickly—too quickly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Your father would never hear of it; I have n't a penny. Mr. Brand, of
course, has property of his own, eh?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I believe he has some property; but that has nothing to do with
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>With you, of course not; but with your father and sister it must
have. So, as I say, if this were settled, I should feel more at
liberty.</q>
               <pb n="968"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>More at liberty?</q> Gertrude repeated. <q>Please
unfasten the boat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix untwisted the rope and stood holding it. <q>I should be able to
say things to you that I can't give myself the pleasure of saying now,</q>
he went on. <q>I could tell you how much I admire you, without seeming to
pretend to that which I have no right to pretend to. I should make violent
love to you,</q> he added, laughing, <q>if I thought you were so placed as
not to be offended by it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You mean if I were engaged to another man? That is strange
reasoning!</q> Gertrude exclaimed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In that case you would not take me seriously.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I take every one seriously,</q> said Gertrude. And without his help
she stepped lightly into the boat.</p>
            <p>Felix took up the oars and sent it forward. <q>Ah, this is what you have
been thinking about? It seemed to me you had something on your mind. I wish
very much,</q> he added, <q>that you would tell me some of these so-called
reasons—these obligations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They are not real reasons—good reasons,</q> said Gertrude,
looking at the pink and yellow gleams in the water.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I can understand that! Because a handsome girl has had a spark of
coquetry, that is no reason.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If you mean me, it 's not that. I have not done that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is something that troubles you, at any rate,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Not so much as it used to,</q> Gertrude rejoined.</p>
            <p>He looked at her, smiling always. <q>That is not saying much, eh?</q>
But she only rested her eyes, very gravely, on the lighted water. She
seemed to him to be trying to hide the signs of the trouble of which she
had just told him. Felix felt, at all times, much the same impulse to
dissipate visible melancholy that a good housewife feels to brush away
dust. There was something he wished to brush away now; suddenly he stopped
rowing and poised his oars. <q>Why should Mr. Brand have addressed himself
to you, and not to your sister?</q> he asked. <q>I am sure she would listen
to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude, in her family, was thought capable of a good deal of levity;
but her levity had never gone so far as this. It moved her greatly,
however, to hear Felix say that he was sure of something; so that, raising
her eyes toward him, she tried <pb n="969"/>
intently, for some moments, to conjure up this wonderful image
of a love-affair between her own sister and her own suitor. We know that
Gertrude had an imaginative mind; so that it is not impossible that this
effort should have been partially successful. But she only murmured, <q>Ah,
Felix! ah, Felix!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why should n't they marry? Try and make them marry!</q> cried
Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Try and make them?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Turn the tables on them. Then they will leave you alone. I will help
you as far as I can.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude's heart began to beat; she was greatly excited; she had never
had anything so interesting proposed to her before. Felix had begun to row
again, and he now sent the boat home with long strokes. <q>I believe she
does care for him!</q> said Gertrude, after they had disembarked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Of course she does, and we will marry them off. It will make them
happy; it will make every one happy. We shall have a wedding and I will
write an epithalamium.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It seems as if it would make me happy,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To get rid of Mr. Brand, eh? To recover your liberty?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude walked on. <q>To see my sister married to so good a
man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix gave his light laugh. <q>You always put things on those grounds;
you will never say anything for yourself. You are all so afraid, here, of
being selfish. I don't think you know how,</q> he went on. <q>Let me show
you! It will make me happy for myself, and for  just the reverse of what I
told you a while ago. After that, when I make love to you, you will have to
think I mean it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall never think you mean anything,</q> said Gertrude. <q>You are
too fantastic.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah,</q> cried Felix, <q>that 's a license to say everything!
Gertrude, I adore you!</q>

            <p>Charlotte and Mr. Brand had not returned when they reached the house;
but the Baroness had come to tea, and Robert Acton also, who now regularly
asked for a place at this generous repast or made his appearance later in
the evening. Clifford Wentworth, with his juvenile growl, remarked upon
it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You are always coming to tea nowadays, Robert,</q> he said. <q>I
should think you had drunk enough tea in Chin a.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Since when is Mr. Acton more frequent?</q> asked the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Since you came,</q> said Clifford. <q>It seems as if you were a kind
of attraction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I suppose I am a curiosity,</q> said the Baroness. <q>Give me time
and I will make you a salon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It would fall to pieces after you go!</q> exclaimed Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't talk about her going, in that familiar way,</q> Clifford said.
<q>It makes me feel gloomy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth glanced at his son, and taking note of these words,
wondered if Felix had been teaching him, according to the programme he had
sketched out, to make love to the wife of a German prince.</p>
            <p>Charlotte came in late with Mr. Brand; but Gertrude, to whom, at least,
Felix had taught something, looked in vain, in her face, for the traces of
a guilty passion. Mr. Brand sat down by Gertrude, and she presently asked
him why they had not crossed the pond to join Felix and herself.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is cruel of you to ask me that,</q> he answered, very softly. He
had a large morsel of cake before him; but he fingered it without eating
it. <q>I sometimes think you are growing cruel,</q> he added.</p>
            <p>Gertrude said nothing; she was afraid to speak. There was a kind of rage
in her heart; she felt as if she could easily persuade herself that she was
persecuted. She said to herself that it was quite right that she should not
allow him to make her believe she was wrong. She thought of what Felix had
said to her; she wished indeed Mr. Brand would marry Charlotte. She looked
away from him and spoke no more. Mr. Brand <pb n="971"/>
ended by eating his cake, while Felix sat opposite, describing
to Mr. Wentworth the students' duels at Heidelberg. After tea they all
dispersed themselves, as usual, upon the piazza and in the garden; and Mr.
Brand drew near to Gertrude again.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I did n't come to you this afternoon because you were not alone,</q>
he began; <q>because you were with a newer friend.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Felix? He is an old friend by this time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand looked at the ground for some moments. <q>I thought I was
prepared to hear you speak in that way,</q> he resumed. <q>But I find it
very painful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't see what else I can say,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand walked beside her for a while in silence; Gertrude wished he
would go away. <q>He is certainly very accomplished. But I think I ought to
advise you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To advise me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think I know your nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think you don't,</q> said Gertrude, with a soft laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You make yourself out worse than you are—to please him,</q> Mr.
Brand said, gently.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Worse—to please him? What do you mean?</q> asked Gertrude,
stopping.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand stopped also, and with the same soft straight-forwardness,
<q>He does n't care for the things you care for—the great questions
of life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude, with her eyes on his, shook her head. <q>I don't care for the
great questions of life. They are much beyond me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There was a time when you did n't say that,</q> said Mr. Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh,</q> rejoined Gertrude, <q>I think you made me talk a great deal
of nonsense. And it depends,</q> she added, <q>upon what you call the great
questions of life. There are some things I care for.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Are they the things you talk about with your cousin?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You should not say things to me against my cousin, Mr. Brand,</q>
said Gertrude. <q>That is dishonorable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He listened to this respectfully; then he answered, with a little
vibration of the voice, <q>I should be very sorry to do anything
dishonorable. But I don't see why it is dishonorable to say that your
cousin is frivolous.</q>
               <pb n="972"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Go and say it to himself!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think he would admit it,</q> said Mr. Brand. <q>That is the tone he
would take. He would not be ashamed of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Then I am not ashamed of it!</q> Gertrude declared. <q>That is
probably what I like him for. I am frivolous myself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are trying, as I said just now, to lower yourself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am trying for once to be natural!</q> cried Gertrude passionately.
<q>I have been pretending, all my life; I have been dishonest; it is you
that have made me so!</q> Mr. Brand stood gazing at her, and she went on,
<q>Why should n't I be frivolous, if I want? One has a right to be
frivolous, if it 's one's nature. No, I don't care for the great questions.
I care for pleasure—for amusement. Perhaps I am fond of wicked
things; it is very possible!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand remained staring; he was even a little pale, as if he had been
frightened. <q>I don't think you know what you are saying!</q> he
exclaimed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Perhaps not. Perhaps I am talking nonsense. But it is only with you
that I talk nonsense. I never do so with my cousin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I will speak to you again, when you are less excited,</q> said Mr.
Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am always excited when you speak to me. I must tell you
that—even if it prevents you altogether, in future. Your speaking to
me irritates me. With my cousin it is very different. That seems quiet and
natural.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He looked at her, and then he looked away, with a kind of helpless
distress, at the dusky garden and the faint summer stars. After which,
suddenly turning back, <q>Gertrude, Gertrude!</q> he softly groaned. <q>Am
I really losing you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>She was touched—she was pained; but it had already occurred to her
that she might do something better than say so. It would not have
alleviated her companion's distress to perceive, just then, whence she had
sympathetically borrowed this ingenuity. <q>I am not sorry for you,</q>
Gertrude said; <q>for in paying so much attention to me you are following a
shadow—you are wasting something precious. There is something else
you might have that you don't look at—something better than I am.
That is a reality!</q> And then, with intention, she looked at him and
tried to smile a little. He <pb n="973"/>
thought this smile of hers very strange; but she turned away
and left him.</p>
            <p>She wandered about alone in the garden wondering what Mr. Brand would
make of her words, which it had been a singular pleasure for her to utter.
Shortly after, passing in front of the house, she saw at a distance two
persons standing near the garden gate. It was Mr. Brand going away and
bidding good-night to Charlotte, who had walked down with him from the
house. Gertrude saw that the parting was prolonged. Then she turned her
back upon it. She had not gone very far, however, when she heard her sister
slowly following her. She neither turned round nor waited for her; she knew
what Charlotte was going to say. Charlotte, who at last overtook her, in
fact presently began; she had passed her arm into Gertrude's.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Will you listen to me, dear, if I say something very
particular?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I know what you are going to say,</q> said Gertrude. <q>Mr. Brand
feels very badly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, Gertrude, how can you treat him so?</q> Charlotte demanded. And
as her sister made no answer she added, <q>After all he has done for
you!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What has he done for me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I wonder you can ask, Gertrude. He has helped you so. You told me so
yourself, a great many times. You told me that he helped you to struggle
with your—your peculiarities. You told me that he had taught you how
to govern your temper.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For a moment Gertrude said nothing. Then, <q>Was my temper very bad?</q>
she asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not accusing you, Gertrude,</q> said Charlotte.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What are you doing, then?</q> her sister demanded, with a short
laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am pleading for Mr. Brand—reminding you of all you owe
him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have given it all back,</q> said Gertrude, still with her little
laugh. <q>He can take back the virtue he imparted! I want to be wicked
again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Her sister made her stop in the path, and fixed upon her, in the
darkness, a sweet, reproachful gaze. <q>If you talk this <pb n="974"/>
way I shall almost believe it. Think of all we owe Mr. Brand.
Think of how he has always expected something of you. Think how much he has
been to us. Think of his beautiful influence upon Clifford.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He is very good,</q>said Gertrude, looking at her sister. <q>I know
he is very good. But he should n't speak against Felix.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Felix is good,</q> Charlotte answered, softly but promptly. <q>Felix
is very wonderful. Only he is so different. Mr. Brand is much nearer to us.
I should never think of going to Felix with a trouble—with a
question. Mr. Brand is much more to us, Gertrude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He is very—very good,</q> Gertrude repeated. <q>He is more to
you; yes, much more. Charlotte,</q> she added suddenly, <q>you are in love
with him!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, Gertrude!</q> cried poor Charlotte; and her sister saw her
blushing in the darkness.</p>
            <p>Gertrude put her arm round her. <q>I wish he would marry you!</q> she
went on.</p>
            <p>Charlotte shook herself free. <q>You must not say such things!</q> she
exclaimed, beneath her breath.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You like him more than you say, and he likes you more than he
knows.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This is very cruel of you!</q> Charlotte Wentworth murmured.</p>
            <p>But if it was cruel Gertrude continued pitiless. <q>Not if it 's
true,</q> she answered. <q>I wish he would marry you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Please don't say that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I mean to tell him so!</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude!</q> her sister almost moaned.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, if he speaks to me again about myself. I will say, `Why don't
you marry Charlotte? She 's a thousand times better than I.' </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are wicked; you are changed!</q> cried her sister.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If you don't like it you can prevent it,</q> said Gertrude. <q>You
can prevent it by keeping him from speaking to me!</q> And with this she
walked away, very conscious of what she had done; measuring it and finding
a certain joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth was rather wide of the mark in suspecting that Clifford
had begun to pay unscrupulous compliments to <pb n="975"/>
his brilliant cousin; for the young man had really more
scruples than he received credit for in his family. He had a certain
transparent shamefacedness which was in itself a proof that he was not at
his ease in dissipation. His collegiate peccadilloes had aroused a domestic
murmur as disagreeable to the young man as the creaking of his boots would
have been to a house-breaker. Only, as the house-breaker would have
simplified matters by removing his chaussures, it had seemed to Clifford
that the shortest cut to comfortable relations with people—relations
which should make him cease to think that when they spoke to him they meant
something improving—was to renounce all ambition toward a nefarious
development. And, in fact, Clifford's ambition took the most commendable
form. He thought of himself in the future as the well-known and much-liked
Mr. Wentworth, of Boston, who should, in the natural course of prosperity,
have married his pretty cousin, Lizzie Acton; should live in a wide-fronted
house, in view of the Common; and should drive, behind a light wagon, over
the damp autumn roads, a pair of beautifully matched sorrel horses.
Clifford's vision of the coming years was very simple; its most definite
features were this element of familiar matrimony and the duplication of his
resources for trotting. He had not yet asked his cousin to marry him; but
he meant to do so as soon as he had taken his degree. Lizzie was serenely
conscious of his intention, and she had made up her mind that he would
improve. Her brother, who was very fond of this light, quick, competent
little Lizzie, saw on his side no reason to interpose. It seemed to him a
graceful social law that Clifford and his sister should become engaged; he
himself was not engaged, but every one else, fortunately, was not such a
fool as he. He was fond of Clifford, as well, and had his own way—of
which it must be confessed he was a little ashamed—of looking at
those aberrations which had led to the young man's compulsory retirement
from the neighboring seat of learning. Acton had seen the world, as he said
to himself; he had been to Chin a and had knocked about among men. He had
learned the essential difference between a nice young fellow and a mean
young fellow, and was satisfied that there was no harm in Clifford. He
believed—although it must be added that he had not quite the courage
to declare <pb n="976"/>
it—in the doctrine of wild oats, and thought it a useful
preventive of superfluous fears. If Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte and Mr.
Brand would only apply it in Clifford's case, they would be happier; and
Acton thought it a pity they should not be happier. They took the boy's
misdemeanors too much to heart; they talked to him too solemnly; they
frightened and bewildered him. Of course there was the great standard of
morality, which forbade that a man should get tipsy, play at billiards for
money, or cultivate his sensual consciousness; but what fear was there that
poor Clifford was going  to run a tilt at any great standard? It had,
however, never occurred to Acton to dedicate the Baroness Münster to
the redemption of a refractory collegian. The instrument, here, would have
seemed to him quite too complex for the operation. Felix, on the other
hand, had spoken in obedience to the belief that the more charming a woman
is the more numerous, literally, are her definite social uses.</p>
            <p>Eugenia herself, as we know, had plenty of leisure to enumerate her
uses. As I have had the honor of intimating, she had come four thousand
miles to seek her fortune; and it is not to be supposed that after this
great effort she could neglect any apparent aid to advancement. It is my
misfortune that in attempting to describe in a short compass the deportment
of this remarkable woman I am obliged to express things rather brutally. I
feel this to be the case, for instance, when I say that she had primarily
detected such an aid to advancement in the person of Robert Acton, but that
she had afterwards remembered that a prudent archer has always a second
bowstring. Eugenia was a woman of finely-mingled motive, and her intentions
were never sensibly gross. She had a sort of æsthetic ideal for Clifford
which seemed to her a disinterested reason for taking him in hand. It was
very well for a fresh-colored young gentleman to be ingenuous; but
Clifford, really, was crude. With such a pretty face he ought to have
prettier manners. She would teach him that, with a beautiful name, the
expectation of a large property, and, as they said in Europe, a social
position, an only son should know how to carry himself.</p>
            <p>Once Clifford had begun to come and see her by himself and for himself,
he came very often. He hardly knew why he <pb n="977"/>
should come; he saw her almost every evening at his father's
house; he had nothing particular to say to her. She was not a young girl,
and fellows of his age called only upon young girls. He exaggerated her
age; she seemed to him an old woman; it was happy that the Baroness, with
all her intelligence, was incapable of guessing this. But gradually it
struck Clifford that visiting old women might be, if not a natural, at
least, as they say of some articles of diet, an acquired taste. The
Baroness was certainly a very amusing old woman; she talked to him as no
lady—and indeed no gentleman—had ever talked to him before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You should go to Europe and make the tour,</q> she said to him one
afternoon. <q>Of course, on leaving college you will go.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't want to go,</q> Clifford declared. <q>I know some fellows who
have been to Europe. They say you can have better fun here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That depends. It depends upon your idea of fun. Your friends probably
were not introduced.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Introduced?</q> Clifford demanded.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They had no opportunity of going into society; they formed no
relations.</q> This was one of a certain number of words that the Baroness
often pronounced in the French manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They went to a ball, in Paris; I know that,</q> said Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, there are balls and balls; especially in Paris. No, you must go,
you know; it is not a thing from which you can dispense yourself. You need
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, I 'm very well,</q> said Clifford. <q>I 'm not sick.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't mean for your health, my poor child. I mean for your
manners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have n't got any manners!</q> growled Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Precisely. You don't mind my assenting to that, eh?</q> asked the
Baroness with a smile. <q>You must go to Europe and get a few. You can get
them better there. It is a pity you might not have come while I was living
in—in Germany. I would have introduced you; I had a charming little
circle. You would perhaps have been rather young; but the younger one
begins, I  think, the better. Now, at any rate, you have no time to lose,
and when I return you must immediately come to me.</q>
               <pb n="978"/>
            </p>
            <p>All this, to Clifford's apprehension, was a great
mixture—his beginning young, Eugenia's return to Europe, his being
introduced to her charming little circle. What was he to begin, and what
was her little circle? His ideas about her marriage had a good deal of
vagueness; but they were in so far definite as that he felt it to be a
matter not to be freely mentioned. He sat and looked all round the room; he
supposed she was alluding in some way to her marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, I don't want to go to Germany,</q> he said; it seemed to him the
most convenient thing to say.</p>
            <p>She looked at him a while, smiling with her lips, but not with her
eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have scruples?</q> she asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Scruples?</q> said Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You young people, here, are very singular; one does n't know where to
expect you. When you are not extremely improper you are so terribly proper.
I dare say you think that, owing to my irregular marriage, I live with
loose people. You were never more mistaken. I have been all the more
particular.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, no,</q> said Clifford, honestly distressed. <q>I never thought
such a thing as that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Are you very sure? I am convinced that your father does, and your
sisters. They say to each other that here I am on my good behavior, but
that over there—married by the left hand—I associate with light
women.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, no,</q> cried Clifford, energetically, <q>they don't say such
things as that to each other!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If they think them they had better say them,</q> the Baroness
rejoined. <q>Then they can be contradicted. Please contradict that whenever
you hear it, and don't be afraid of coming to see me on account of the
company I keep. I have the honor of knowing more distinguished men, my poor
child, than you are likely to see in a life-time. I see very few women; but
those are women of rank. So, my dear young Puritan, you need n't be afraid.
I am not in the least one of those who think that the society of women who
have lost their place in the vrai monde is necessary to form a young man. I
have never taken that tone. I have kept my place myself, and I think we are
a much better school than the others. Trust me, Clifford, <pb n="979"/>
and I will prove that to you,</q> the Baroness continued, while
she made the agreeable reflection that she could not, at least, be accused
of perverting her young kinsman. <q>So if you ever fall among thieves don't
go about saying I sent you to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford thought it so comical that he should know—in spite of her
figurative language—what she meant, and that she should mean what he
knew, that he could hardly help laughing a little, although he tried hard.
<q>Oh, no! oh, no!</q> he murmured.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Laugh out, laugh out, if I amuse you!</q> cried the Baroness. <q>I am
here for that!</q> And Clifford thought her a very amusing person indeed.
<q>But remember,</q> she said on this occasion, <q>that you are
coming—next year—to pay me a visit over there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About a week afterwards she said to him, point-blank, <q>Are you
seriously making love to your little cousin?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Seriously making love</q>—these words, on Madame Münster's
lips, had to Clifford's sense a portentous and embarrassing sound; he
hesitated about assenting, lest he should commit himself to more than he
understood. <q>Well, I should n't say it if I was!</q> he exclaimed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why would n't you say it?</q> the Baroness demanded. <q>Those things
ought to be known.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't care whether it is known or not,</q> Clifford rejoined.
<q>But I don't want  people looking at me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A young man of your importance ought to learn to bear
observation—to carry himself as if he were quite indifferent to it. I
won't say, exactly, unconscious,</q> the Baroness explained. <q>No, he must
seem to know he is observed, and to think it natural he should be; but he
must appear perfectly used to it. Now you have n't that, Clifford; you have
n't that at all. You must have that, you know. Don't tell me you are not a
young man of importance,</q> Eugenia added. <q>Don't say anything so flat
as that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, no, you don't catch me saying that!</q> cried Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, you must come to Germany,</q> Madame Münster continued.
<q>I will show you how people can be talked about, and yet not seem to know
it. You will be talked about, of course, with me; it will be said you are
my lover. I will show you how little one may mind that—how little I
shall mind it.</q>
               <pb n="980"/>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford sat staring, blushing and laughing. <q>I shall mind
it a good deal!</q> he declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, not too much, you know; that would be uncivil. But I give you
leave to mind it a little; especially if you have a passion for Miss Acton.
Voyons; as regards that, you either have or you have not. It is very simple
to say it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't see why you want to know,</q> said Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ought to want me to know. If one is arranging a marriage, one
tells one's friends.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, I 'm not arranging anything,</q> said Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You don't intend to marry your cousin?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I expect I shall do as I choose!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness leaned her head upon the back of her chair and closed her
eyes, as if she were tired. Then opening them again, <q>Your cousin is very
charming!</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She is the prettiest girl in this place,</q> Clifford rejoined.</p>
            <p>
               <q> `In this place' is saying little; she would be charming anywhere. I
am afraid you are entangled.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, no, I 'm not entangled.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Are you engaged? At your age that is the same thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford looked at the Baroness with some audacity. <q>Will you tell no
one?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If it 's as sacred as that—no.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, then—we are not!</q> said Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's the great secret—that you are not, eh?</q> asked the
Baroness, with a quick laugh. <q>I am very glad to hear it. You are
altogether too young. A young man in your position must choose and compare;
he must see the world first. Depend upon it,</q> she added, <q>you should
not settle that matter before you have come abroad and paid me that visit.
There are several things I should like to call your attention to
first.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I am rather afraid of that visit,</q> said Clifford. <q>It
seems to me it will be rather like going to school again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness looked at him a moment.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear child,</q> she said, <q>there is no agreeable man who has
not, at some moment, been to school to a clever woman—probably a
little older than himself. And you must be thankful when you get your
instructions gratis. With me you would get it gratis.</q>
               <pb n="981"/>
            </p>
            <p>The next day Clifford told Lizzie Acton that the Baroness
thought her the most charming girl she had ever seen.</p>
            <p>Lizzie shook her head. <q>No, she does n't!</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you think everything she says,</q> asked Clifford, <q>is to be
taken the opposite way?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think that is!</q> said Lizzie.</p>
            <p>Clifford was going to remark that in this case the Baroness must desire
greatly to bring about a marriage between Mr. Clifford Wentworth and Miss
Elizabeth Acton; but he resolved, on the whole, to suppress this
observation.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="9" type="chapter">

            <pb n="982"/>
            <p>It seemed to Robert Acton, after Eugenia had come to his house, that
something had passed between them which made them a good deal more
intimate. It was hard to say exactly what, except her telling him that she
had taken her resolution with regard to the Prince Adolf; for Madame
Münster's visit had made no difference in their relations. He came to
see her very often; but he had come to see her very often before. It was
agreeable to him to find himself in her little drawing-room; but this was
not a new discovery. There was a change, however, in this sense: that if
the Baroness had been a great deal in Acton's thoughts before, she was now
never out of them. From the first she had been personally fascinating; but
the fascination now had become intellectual as well. He was constantly
pondering her words and motions; they were as interesting as the factors in
an algebraic problem. This is saying a good deal; for Acton was extremely
fond of mathematics. He asked himself whether it could be that he was in
love with her, and then hoped he was not; hoped it not so much for his own
sake as for that of the amatory passion itself. If this was love, love had
been overrated. Love was a poetic impulse, and his own state of feeling
with regard to the Baroness was largely characterized by that eminently
prosaic sentiment—curiosity. It was true, as Acton with his quietly
cogitative habit observed to himself, that curiosity, pushed to a given
point, might become a romantic passion; and he certainly thought enough
about this charming woman to make him restless and even a little
melancholy. It puzzled and vexed him at times to feel that he was not more
ardent. He was not in the least bent upon remaining a bachelor. In his
younger years he had been—or he had tried to be—of the opinion
that it would be a good deal <q>jollier</q> not to marry, and he had
flattered himself that his single condition was something of a citadel. It
was a citadel, at all events, of which he had long since leveled the
outworks. He had removed the guns from the ramparts; he had lowered the
draw-bridge across the moat. The draw-bridge had swayed lightly under
Madame Münster's step; why should he not cause it to <pb n="983"/>
be raised again, so that she might be kept prisoner? He had an
idea that she would become—in time at least, and on learning the
conveniences of the place for making a lady comfortable—a tolerably
patient captive. But the draw-bridge was never raised, and Acton's
brilliant visitor was as free to depart as she had been to come. It was
part of his curiosity to know why the deuce so susceptible a man was not in
love with so charming a woman. If her various graces were, as I  have said,
the factors in an algebraic problem, the answer to this question was the
indispensable unknown quantity. The pursuit of the unknown quantity was
extremely absorbing; for the present it taxed all Acton's faculties.</p>
            <p>Toward the middle of August he was obliged to leave home for some days;
an old friend, with whom he had been associated  in Chin a, had begged him
to come to Newport, where he lay extremely ill. His friend got better, and
at the end of a week Acton was released. I use the word <q>released</q>
advisedly; for in spite of his attachment to his Chinese comrade he had
been but a half-hearted visitor. He felt as if he had been called away from
the theatre during the progress of a remarkably interesting drama. The
curtain was up all this time, and he was losing the fourth act; that fourth
act which would have been so essential to a just appreciation of the fifth.
In other words, he was thinking about the Baroness, who, seen at this
distance, seemed a truly brilliant figure. He saw at Newport a great many
pretty women, who certainly were figures as brilliant as beautiful light
dresses could make them; but though they talked a great deal—and the
Baroness's strong point was perhaps also her conversation—Madame
Münster appeared to lose nothing by the comparison. He wished she had
come to Newport too. Would it not be possible to make up, as they said, a
party for visiting the famous watering-place and invite Eugenia to join it?
It was true that the complete satisfaction would be to spend a fortnight at
Newport with Eugenia alone. It would be a great pleasure to see her, in
society, carry everything before her, as he was sure she would do. When
Acton caught himself thinking these thoughts he began to walk up and down,
with his hands in his pockets, frowning a little and looking at the floor.
What did it prove—for it certainly proved something—this lively<pb n="984"/>
disposition to be <q>off</q> somewhere with Madame
Münster, away from all the rest of them? Such a vision, certainly,
seemed a refined implication of matrimony, after the Baroness should have
formally got rid of her informal husband. At any rate, Acton, with his
characteristic discretion, forbore to give expression to whatever else it
might imply, and the narrator of these incidents is not obliged to be more
definite.</p>
            <p>He returned home rapidly, and, arriving in the afternoon, lost as little
time as possible in joining the familiar circle at Mr. Wentworth's. On
reaching the house, however, he found the piazzas empty. The doors and
windows were open, and their emptiness was made clear by the shafts of
lamp-light from the parlors. Entering the house, he found Mr. Wentworth
sitting alone in one of these apartments, engaged in the perusal of the
<q>North American Review.</q> After they had exchanged greetings and his
cousin had made discreet inquiry about his journey, Acton asked what had
become of Mr. Wentworth's companions.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They are scattered about, amusing themselves as usual,</q> said the
old man. <q>I saw Charlotte, a short time since, seated, with Mr. Brand,
upon the piazza. They were conversing with their customary animation. I
suppose they have joined her sister, who, for the hundredth time, was doing
the honors of the garden to her foreign cousin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I suppose you mean Felix,</q> said Acton. And on Mr. Wentworth's
assenting, he said, <q>And the others?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your sister has not come this evening. You must have seen her at
home,</q>said Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes. I proposed to her to come. She declined.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Lizzie, I suppose, was expecting a visitor,</q> said the old man,
with a kind of solemn slyness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If she was expecting  Clifford, he had not turned up.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth, at this intelligence, closed the <q>North American
Review</q> and remarked that he had understood Clifford to say that he was
going to see his cousin. Privately, he reflected that if Lizzie Acton had
had no news of his son, Clifford must have gone to Boston for the evening:
an unnatural course of a summer night, especially when accompanied with
disingenuous representations.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You must remember that he has two cousins,</q> said Acton, <pb n="985"/>
laughing. And then, coming to the point, <q>If Lizzie is not
here,</q> he added, <q>neither apparently is the Baroness.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth stared a moment, and remembered that queer proposition of
Felix's. For a moment he did not know whether it was not to be wished that
Clifford, after all, might have gone to Boston. <q>The Baroness has not
honored us tonight,</q> he said. <q>She has not come over for three
days.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Is she ill?</q> Acton asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>No; I have been to see her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What is the matter with her?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, <q>I infer she has tired of us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton pretended to sit down, but he was restless; he found it impossible
to talk with Mr. Wentworth. At the end of ten minutes he took up his hat
and said that he thought he would <q>go off.</q> It was very late; it was
ten o'clock.</p>
            <p>His quiet-faced kinsman looked at him a moment. <q>Are you going
home?</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>Acton hesitated, and then answered that he had proposed to go over and
take a look at the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, you are honest, at least,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, sadly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So are you, if you come to that!</q> cried Acton, laughing. <q>Why
should n't I be honest?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The old man opened the <q>North American</q> again, and read a few
lines. <q>If we have ever had any virtue among us, we had better keep hold
of it now,</q> he said. He was not quoting.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We have a Baroness among us,</q> said Acton.<q>That 's what we must
keep hold of!</q> He was too impatient to see Madame Münster again to
wonder what Mr. Wentworth was talking about. Nevertheless, after he had
passed out of the house and traversed the garden and the little piece of
road that separated him from Eugenia's provisional residence, he stopped a
moment outside. He stood in her little garden; the long window of her
parlor was open, and he could see the white curtains, with the lamp-light
shining through them, swaying softly to and fro in the warm night wind.
There was a sort of excitement in the idea of seeing Madame Münster
again; he became aware that his heart was beating rather faster than usual.
It was this that made him stop, with a half-amused surprise. But in a
moment he went along the piazza, and, approaching the open window, tapped
upon its lintel with his stick. He could <pb n="986"/>
see the Baroness within; she was standing in the middle of the
room. She came to the window and pulled aside the curtain; then she stood
looking at him a moment.  She was not smiling; she seemed serious.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mais entrez donc!</q> she said at last. Acton passed in across the
window-sill; he wondered, for an instant, what was the matter with her. But
the next moment she had begun to smile and had put out her hand. <q>Better
late than never,</q> she said. <q>It is very kind of you to come at this
hour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have just returned from my journey,</q> said Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, very kind, very kind,</q> she repeated, looking about her where
to sit.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I went first to the other house,</q> Acton continued. <q>I expected
to find you there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She had sunk into her usual chair; but she got up again, and began to
move about the room. Acton had laid down his hat and stick; he was looking
at her, conscious that there was in fact a great charm in seeing her again.
<q>I don't know  whether I ought to tell you to sit down,</q> she said.
<q>It is too late to begin a visit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's too early to end one,</q> Acton declared; <q>and we need n't
mind the beginning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She looked at him again, and, after a moment, dropped once more into her
low chair, while he took a place near her. <q>We are in the middle,
then?</q> she asked. <q>Was that where we were when you went away? No, I
have n't been to the other house.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Not yesterday, nor the day before, eh?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know how many days it is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are tired of it,</q> said Acton.</p>
            <p>She leaned back in her chair; her arms were folded. <q>That is a
terrible accusation, but I have not the courage to defend myself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not attacking you,</q> said Acton. <q>I expected something of
this kind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's a proof of extreme intelligence. I hope you enjoyed your
journey.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Not at all,</q> Acton declared. <q>I would much rather have been here
with you.</q>
               <pb n="987"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now you are attacking me,</q> said the Baroness. <q>You
are contrasting my inconstancy with your own fidelity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I confess I never get tired of people I like.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, you are not a poor wicked foreign woman, with irritable nerves
and a sophisticated mind!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Something has happened to you since I went away,</q> said Acton,
changing his place.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Your going away—that is what has happened to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you mean to say that you have missed me?</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If I had meant to say it, it would not be worth your making a note
of. I am very dishonest and my compliments are worthless.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton was silent for some moments. <q>You have broken down,</q> he said
at last.</p>
            <p>Madame Münster left her chair, and began to move about.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Only for a moment. I shall pull myself together again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You had better not take it too hard. If you are bored, you need n't
be afraid to say so—to me at least.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You should n't say such things as that,</q> the Baroness answered.
<q>You should encourage me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I admire your patience; that is encouraging.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You should n't even say that. When you talk of my patience you are
disloyal to your own people. Patience implies suffering; and what have I
had to suffer?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, not hunger, not unkindness, certainly,</q> said Acton, laughing.
<q>Nevertheless, we all admire your patience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You all detest me!</q> cried the Baroness, with a sudden vehemence,
turning her back toward him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You make it hard,</q> said Acton, getting up, <q>for a man to say
something tender to you.</q> This evening there was something particularly
striking and touching about her; an unwonted softness and a look of
suppressed emotion. He felt himself suddenly appreciating the fact that she
had behaved very well. She had come to this quiet corner of the world under
the weight of a cruel indignity, and she had been so gracefully, modestly
thankful for the rest she found there. She had joined that simple circle
over the way; she had mingled in its plain, provincial talk; she had shared
its meagre and savorless pleasures. She had set herself a task, and she had<pb n="988"/>
rigidly performed it. She had conformed to the angular
conditions of New England life, and she had had the tact and pluck to carry
it off as if she liked them. Acton felt a more downright need than he had
ever felt before to tell her that he admired her and that she struck him as
a very superior woman. All along, hitherto, he had been on his guard with
her; he had been cautious, observant, suspicious. But now a certain light
tumult in his blood seemed to tell him that a finer degree of confidence in
this charming woman would be its own reward. <q>We don't detest you,</q> he
went on. <q>I don't know what you mean. At any rate, I speak for myself; I
don't know anything about the others. Very likely, you detest them for the
dull life they make you lead. Really, it would give me a sort of pleasure
to hear you say so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia had been looking at the door on the other side of the room; now
she slowly turned her eyes toward Robert Acton. <q>What can be the
motive,</q> she asked, <q>of a man like you—an honest man, a galant
homme—in saying so base a thing as that?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Does it sound very base?</q> asked Acton, candidly. <q>I suppose it
does, and I thank you for telling me so. Of course, I don't mean it
literally.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness stood looking at him. <q>How do you mean it?</q> she
asked.</p>
            <p>This question was difficult to answer, and Acton, feeling the least bit
foolish, walked to the open window and looked out. He stood there, thinking
a moment, and then he turned back. <q>You know that document that you were
to send to Germany,</q> he said. <q>You called it your `renunciation.' Did
you ever send it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madame Münster's eyes expanded; she looked very grave. <q>What a
singular answer to my question!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, it is n't an answer,</q> said Acton. <q>I have wished to ask you,
many times. I thought it probable you would tell me yourself. The question,
on my part, seems abrupt now; but it would be abrupt at any time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness was silent a moment; and then, <q>I think I have told you
too much!</q> she said.</p>
            <p>This declaration appeared to Acton to have a certain force; he had
indeed a sense of asking more of her than he offered <pb n="989"/>
her. He returned to the window, and watched, for a moment, a
little star that twinkled through the lattice of the piazza. There were at
any rate offers enough he could make; perhaps he had hitherto not been
sufficiently explicit in doing so. <q>I wish you would ask something of
me,</q> he presently said. <q>Is there nothing I can do for you? If you
can't stand this dull life any more, let me amuse you!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness had sunk once more into a chair, and she had taken up a fan
which she held, with both hands, to her mouth. Over the top of the fan her
eyes were fixed on him. <q>You are very strange to-night,</q> she said,
with a little laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I will do anything in the world,</q> he rejoined, standing in front
of her. <q>Should n't you like to travel about and see something of the
country? Won't you go to Niagara? You ought to see Niagara, you
know.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>With you, do you mean?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should be delighted to take you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You alone?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton looked at her, smiling, and yet with a serious air. <q>Well, yes;
we might go alone,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If you were not what you are,</q> she answered, <q>I should feel
insulted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>How do you mean—what I am?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If you were one of the gentlemen I have been used to all my life. If
you were not a queer Bostonian.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If the gentlemen you have been used to have taught you to expect
insults,</q> said Acton, <q>I am glad I am what I am. You had much better
come to Niagara.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If you wish to `amuse' me,</q> the Baroness declared, <q>you need go
to no further expense. You amuse me very effectually.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He sat down opposite to her; she still held her fan up to her face, with
her eyes only showing above it. There was a moment's silence, and then he
said, returning to his former question, <q>Have you sent that document to
Germany?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again there was a moment's silence. The expressive eyes of Madame
Münster seemed, however, half to break it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I will tell you—at Niagara!</q> she said.</p>
            <p>She had hardly spoken when the door at the further end of the room
opened—the door upon which, some minutes previous, <pb n="990"/>
Eugenia had fixed her gaze. Clifford Wentworth stood there,
blushing and looking rather awkward. The Baroness rose, quickly, and Acton,
more slowly, did the same. Clifford gave him no greeting; he was looking at
Eugenia.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, you were here?</q> exclaimed Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He was in Felix's studio,</q> said Madame Münster. <q>He wanted
to see his sketches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford looked at Robert Acton, but said nothing; he only fanned
himself with his hat. <q>You chose a bad moment,</q> said Acton; <q>you had
n't much light.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I had n't any!</q> said Clifford, laughing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Your candle went out?</q> Eugenia asked. <q>You should have come back
here and lighted it again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford looked at her a moment. <q>So I have—come back. But I
have left the candle!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia turned away. <q>You are very stupid, my poor boy. You had better
go home.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> said Clifford, <q>good night!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Have n't you a word to throw to a man when he has safely returned
from a dangerous journey?</q> Acton asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>How do you do?</q> said Clifford. <q>I thought—I thought you
were</q>—and he paused, looking at the Baroness again.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You thought I was at Newport, eh? So I was—this
morning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Good night, clever child!</q> said Madame Münster, over her
shoulder.</p>
            <p>Clifford stared at her—not at all like a clever child; and then,
with one of his little facetious growls, took his departure.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What is the matter with him?</q> asked Acton, when he was gone. <q>He
seemed rather in a muddle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia, who was near the window, glanced out, listening a moment.
<q>The matter—the matter</q>—she answered. <q>But you don't say
such things here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If you mean that he had been drinking a little, you can say
that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He does n't drink any more. I have cured him. And in return—he
's in love with me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was Acton's turn to stare. He instantly thought of his sister; but he
said nothing about her. He began to laugh. <q>I <pb n="991"/>
don't wonder at his passion! But I wonder at his forsaking your
society for that of your brother's paint-brushes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia was silent a little. <q>He had not been in the studio. I
invented that at the moment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Invented it? For what purpose?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He has an idea of being romantic. He has adopted the habit of coming
to see me at midnight—passing only through the orchard and through
Felix's painting-room, which has a door opening that way. It seems to amuse
him,</q> added Eugenia, with a little laugh.</p>
            <p>Acton felt more surprise than he confessed to, for this was a new view
of Clifford, whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without the
romantic element. He tried to laugh again, but he felt rather too serious,
and after a moment's hesitation his seriousness explained itself. <q>I hope
you don't encourage him,</q> he said. <q>He must not be inconstant to poor
Lizzie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To your sister?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You know they are decidedly intimate,</q> said Acton.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah,</q> cried Eugenia, smiling, <q>has she—has
she</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know,</q> Acton interrupted, <q>what she has. But I always
supposed that Clifford had a desire to make himself agreeable to
her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, par exemple!</q> the Baroness went on. <q>The little monster! The
next time he becomes sentimental I will him tell that he ought to be
ashamed of himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton was silent a moment. <q>You had better say nothing about
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I had told him as much already, on general grounds,</q> said the
Baroness. <q>But in this country, you know, the relations of young people
are so extraordinary that one is quite at sea. They are not engaged when
you would quite say they ought to be. Take Charlotte Wentworth, for
instance, and that young ecclesiastic. If I were her father I should insist
upon his marrying her; but it appears to be thought there is no urgency. On
the other hand, you suddenly learn that a boy of twenty and a little girl
who is still with her governess—your sister has no governess? Well,
then, who is never away from her mamma—a young couple, in short,
between whom you have noticed nothing beyond an exchange of the childish
pleasantries characteristic of their age, are on the point of setting<pb n="992"/>
up as man and wife.</q> The Baroness spoke with a certain
exaggerated volubility which was in contrast with the languid grace that
had characterized her manner before Clifford made his appearance. It seemed
to Acton that there was a spark of irritation in her eye—a note of
irony (as when she spoke of Lizzie being never away from her mother) in her
voice. If Madame Münster was irritated, Robert Acton was vaguely
mystified; she began to move about the room again, and he looked at her
without saying anything. Presently she took out her watch, and, glancing at
it, declared that it was three o'clock in the morning and that he must
go.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have not been here an hour,</q> he said, <q>and they are still
sitting up at the other house. You can see the lights. Your brother has not
come in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, at the other house,</q> cried Eugenia, <q>they are terrible
people! I don't know what they may do over there. I am a quiet little
humdrum woman; I have rigid rules and I keep them. One of them is not to
have visitors in the small hours—especially clever men like you. So
good night!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Decidedly, the Baroness was incisive; and though Acton bade her good
night and departed, he was still a good deal mystified.</p>
            <p>The next day Clifford Wentworth came to see Lizzie, and Acton, who was
at home and saw him pass through the garden, took note of the circumstance.
He had a natural desire to make it tally with Madame Münster's account
of Clifford's disaffection; but his ingenuity, finding itself unequal to
the task, resolved at last to ask help of the young man's candor. He waited
till he saw him going away, and then he went out and overtook him in the
grounds.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I wish very much you would answer me a question,</q> Acton said.
<q>What were you doing, last night, at Madame Münster's?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford began to laugh and to blush, by no means like a young man with
a romantic secret. <q>What did she tell you?</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That is exactly what I don't want to say.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I want to tell you the same,</q> said Clifford; <q>and unless I
know it perhaps I can't.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They had stopped in a garden path; Acton looked hard at <pb n="993"/>
his rosy young kinsman. <q>She said she could n't fancy what
had got into you; you appeared to have taken a violent dislike to
her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford stared, looking a little alarmed. <q>Oh, come,</q> he growled,
<q>you don't mean that!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And that when—for common civility's sake—you came
occasionally to the house you left her alone and spent your time in Felix's
studio, under pretext of looking at his sketches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, come!</q> growled Clifford, again.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Did you ever know me to tell an untruth?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, lots of them!</q> said Clifford, seeing an opening, out of the
discussion, for his sarcastic powers. <q>Well,</q> he presently added, <q>I
thought you were my father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You knew some one was there?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We heard you coming in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton meditated. <q>You had been with the Baroness, then?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I was in the parlor. We heard your step outside. I thought it was my
father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And on that,</q> asked Acton, <q>you ran away?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She told me to go—to go out by the studio.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton meditated more intensely; if there had been a chair at hand he
would have sat down. <q>Why should she wish you not to meet your
father?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> said Clifford, <q>father does n't like to see me
there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton looked askance at his companion and forbore to make any comment
upon this assertion. <q>Has he said so,</q> he asked, <q>to the
Baroness?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I hope not,</q> said Clifford. <q>He has n't said so—in
so many words—to me. But I know it worries him; and I want to stop
worrying him. The Baroness knows it, and she wants me to stop, too.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To stop coming to see her?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know about that; but to stop worrying father. Eugenia knows
everything,</q> Clifford added, with an air of knowingness of his own.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah,</q> said Acton, interrogatively, <q>Eugenia knows
everything?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She knew it was not father coming in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Then why did you go?</q>
               <pb n="994"/>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford blushed and laughed afresh. <q>Well, I was afraid
it was. And besides, she told me to go, at any rate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Did she think it was I?</q> Acton asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She did n't say so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again Robert Acton reflected. <q>But you did n't go,</q> he presently
said; <q>you came back.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I could n't get out of the studio,</q> Clifford rejoined. <q>The door
was locked, and Felix has nailed some planks across the lower half of the
confounded windows to make the light come in from above. So they were no
use. I waited there a good while, and then, suddenly, I felt ashamed. I did
n't want to be hiding away from my own father. I could n't stand it any
longer. I bolted out, and when I found it was you I was a little flurried.
But Eugenia carried it off, did n't she?</q> Clifford added, in the tone of
a young humorist whose perception had not been permanently clouded by the
sense of his own discomfort.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Beautifully!</q> said Acton. <q>Especially,</q> he continued, <q>when
one remembers that you were very imprudent and that she must have been a
good deal annoyed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh,</q> cried Clifford, with the indifference of a young man who
feels that however he may have failed of felicity in behavior he is
extremely just in his impressions, <q>Eugenia does n't care for
anything!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton hesitated a moment. <q>Thank you for telling me this,</q> he said
at last. And then, laying his hand on Clifford's shoulder, he added,
<q>Tell me one thing more: are you by chance a little in love with the
Baroness?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No, sir!</q> said Clifford, almost shaking off his hand.</p>

            <pb n="995"/>
            <p>The first sunday that followed Robert Acton's return from Newport
witnessed a change in the brilliant weather that had long prevailed. The
rain began to fall and the day was cold and dreary. Mr. Wentworth and his
daughters put on overshoes and went to church, and Felix Young, without
overshoes, went also, holding an umbrella over Gertrude. It is to be feared
that, in the whole observance, this was the privilege he most highly
valued. The Baroness remained at home; she was in neither a cheerful nor a
devotional mood. She had, however, never been, during her residence in the
United States, what is called a regular attendant at divine service; and on
this particular Sunday morning of which I began with speaking she stood at
the window of her little drawing-room, watching the long arm of a rose-tree
that was attached to her piazza, but a portion of which had disengaged
itself, sway to and fro, shake and gesticulate, against the dusky drizzle
of the sky. Every now and then, in a gust of wind, the rose-tree scattered
a shower of water-drops against the window-pane; it appeared to have a kind
of human movement—a menacing, warning intention. The room was very
cold; Madame Münster put on a shawl and walked about. Then she
determined to have some fire; and summoning her ancient negress, the
contrast of whose polished ebony and whose crimson turban had been at first
a source of satisfaction to her, she made arrangements for the production
of a crackling flame. This old woman's name was Azarin a. The Baroness had
begun by thinking that there would be a savory wildness in her talk, and,
for amusement, she had encouraged her to chatter. But Azarin a was dry and
prim; her conversation was anything but African; she reminded Eugenia of
the tiresome old ladies she met in society. She knew, however, how to make
a fire; so that after she had laid the logs, Eugenia, who was terribly
bored, found a quarter of an hour's entertainment in sitting and watching
them blaze and sputter. She had thought it very likely Robert Acton would
come and see her; she had not met him since that infelicitous evening. But
the morning waned without his <pb n="996"/>
coming; several times she thought she heard his step on the
piazza; but it was only a window-shutter shaking in a rain-gust. The
Baroness, since the beginning of that episode in her career of which a
slight sketch has been attempted in these pages, had had many moments of
irritation. But to-day her irritation had a peculiar keenness; it appeared
to feed upon itself. It urged her to do something; but it suggested no
particularly profitable line of action. If she could have done something at
the moment, on the spot, she would have stepped upon a European steamer and
turned her back, with a kind of rapture, upon that profoundly mortifying
failure, her visit to her American relations. It is not exactly apparent
why she should have termed this enterprise a failure, in as much as she had
been treated with the highest distinction for which allowance had been made
in American institutions. Her irritation came, at bottom, from the sense,
which, always present, had suddenly grown acute, that the social soil on
this big, vague continent was somehow not adapted for growing those plants
whose fragrance she especially inclined to inhale and by which she liked to
see herself surrounded—a species of vegetation for which she carried
a collection of seedlings, as we may say, in her pocket. She found her
chief happiness in the sense of exerting a certain power and making a
certain impression; and now she felt the annoyance of a rather wearied
swimmer who, on nearing shore, to land, finds a smooth straight wall of
rock when he had counted upon a clean firm beach. Her power, in the
American air, seemed to have lost its prehensile attributes; the smooth
wall of rock was insurmountable. <q>Surely je n'en suis pas là,</q>
she said to herself, <q>that I let it make me uncomfortable that a Mr.
Robert Acton should n't honor me with a visit!</q> Yet she was vexed that
he had not come; and she was vexed at her vexation.</p>
            <p>Her brother, at least, came in, stamping in the hall and shaking the wet
from his coat. In a moment he entered the room, with a glow in his cheek
and half-a-dozen rain-drops glistening on his mustache. <q>Ah, you have a
fire,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Les beaux jours sont passés,</q> replied the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Never, never! They have only begun,</q> Felix declared, planting
himself before the hearth. He turned his back to the fire, placed his hands
behind him, extended his legs and <pb n="997"/>
looked away through the window with an expression of face which
seemed to denote the perception of rose-color even in the tints of a wet
Sunday.</p>
            <p>His sister, from her chair, looked up at him, watching him; and what she
saw in his face was not grateful to her present mood. She was puzzled by
many things, but her brother's disposition was a frequent source of wonder
to her. I say frequent and not constant, for there were long periods during
which she gave her attention to other problems. Sometimes she had said to
herself that his happy temper, his eternal gayety, was an affectation, a
pose; but she was vaguely conscious that during the present summer he had
been a highly successful comedian. They had never yet had an explanation;
she had not known the need of one. Felix was presumably following the bent
of his disinterested genius, and she felt that she had no advice to give
him that he would understand. With this, there was always a certain element
of comfort about Felix—the assurance that he would not interfere. He
was very delicate, this pure-minded Felix; in effect, he was her brother,
and Madame Münster felt that there was a great propriety, every way,
in that. It is true that Felix was delicate; he was not fond of
explanations with his sister; this was one of the very few things in the
world about which he was uncomfortable. But now he was not thinking of
anything uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Dear brother,</q> said Eugenia at last, <q>do stop making les yeux
doux at the rain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>With pleasure. I will make them at you!</q> answered Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>How much longer,</q> asked Eugenia, in a moment, <q>do you propose to
remain in this lovely spot?</q>  
            </p>
            <p>Felix stared. <q>Do you want to go away—already?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q> `Already' is delicious. I am not so happy as you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix dropped into a chair, looking at the fire. <q>The fact is I am
happy,</q> he said in his light, clear tone.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And do you propose to spend your life in making love to Gertrude
Wentworth?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes!</q> said Felix, smiling sidewise at his sister.</p>
            <p>The Baroness returned his glance, much more gravely; and then, <q>Do you
like her?</q> she asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't you?</q> Felix demanded.<pb n="998"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness was silent a moment. <q>I will answer you in
the words of the gentleman who was asked if he liked music: `Je ne la
crains pas!' </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She admires you immensely,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't care for that. Other women should not admire one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They should dislike you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again Madame Münster hesitated. <q>They should hate me! It 's a
measure of the time I have been losing here that they don't.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No time is lost in which one has been happy!</q> said Felix, with a
bright sententiousness which may well have been a little irritating.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And in which,</q> rejoined his sister, with a harsher laugh, <q>one
has secured the affections of a young lady with a fortune!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix explained, very candidly and seriously. <q>I have secured
Gertrude's affection, but I am by no means sure that I have secured her
fortune. That may come—or it may not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, well, it may! That 's the great point.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It depends upon her father. He does n't smile upon our union. You
know he wants her to marry Mr. Brand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I know nothing about it!</q> cried the Baroness. <q>Please to put on
a log.</q> Felix complied with her request and sat watching the quickening
of the flame. Presently his sister added, <q>And you propose to elope with
mademoiselle?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By no means. I don't wish to do anything that 's disagreeable to Mr.
Wentworth. He has been far too kind to us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But you must choose between pleasing yourself and pleasing
him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I want to please every one!</q> exclaimed Felix, joyously. <q>I have
a good conscience. I made up my mind at the outset that it was not my place
to make love to Gertrude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So, to simplify matters, she made love to you!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix looked at his sister with sudden gravity. <q>You say you are not
afraid of her,</q> he said. <q>But perhaps you ought to be—a little.
She 's a very clever person.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I begin to see it!</q> cried the Baroness. Her brother, making no
rejoinder, leaned back in his chair, and there was a long <pb n="999"/>
silence. At last, with an altered accent, Madame Münster
put another question. <q>You expect, at any rate, to marry?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall be greatly disappointed if we don't.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A disappointment or two will do you good!</q> the Baroness declared.
<q>And, afterwards, do you mean to turn American?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It seems to me I am a very good American already. But we shall go to
Europe. Gertrude wants extremely to see the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, like me, when I came here!</q> said the Baroness, with a little
laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>No, not like you,</q> Felix rejoined, looking at his sister with a
certain gentle seriousness. While he looked at her she rose from her chair,
and he also got up. <q>Gertrude is not at all like you,</q> he went on;
<q>but in her own way she is almost as clever.</q> He paused a moment; his
soul was full of an agreeable feeling and of a lively disposition to
express it. His sister, to his spiritual vision, was always like the lunar
disk when only a part of it is lighted. The shadow on this bright surface
seemed to him to expand and to contract; but whatever its proportions, he
always appreciated the moonlight. He looked at the Baroness, and then he
kissed her. <q>I am very much in love with Gertrude,</q> he said. Eugenia
turned away and walked about the room, and Felix continued. <q>She is very
interesting, and very different from what she seems. She has never had a
chance. She is very brilliant. We will go to Europe and amuse
ourselves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness had gone to the window, where she stood looking out. The
day was drearier than ever; the rain was doggedly falling. <q>Yes, to amuse
yourselves,</q> she said at last, <q>you had decidedly better go to
Europe!</q> Then she turned round, looking at her brother. A chair stood
near her; she leaned her hands upon the back of it. <q>Don't you think it
is very good of me,</q> she asked, <q>to come all this way with you simply
to see you properly married—if properly it is?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, it will be properly!</q> cried Felix, with light eagerness.</p>
            <p>The Baroness gave a little laugh. <q>You are thinking only of yourself,
and you don't answer my question. While you are amusing yourself—with
the brilliant Gertrude—what shall I be doing?</q>
               <pb n="1000"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Vous serez de la partie!</q> cried Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thank you: I should spoil it.</q> The Baroness dropped her eyes for
some moments. <q>Do you propose, however, to leave me here?</q> she
inquired.</p>
            <p>Felix smiled at her. <q>My dearest sister, where you are concerned I
never propose. I execute your commands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I believe,</q> said Eugenia, slowly, <q>that you are the most
heartless person living. Don't you see that I am in trouble?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I saw that you were not cheerful, and I gave you some good
news.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, let me give you some news,</q> said the Baroness. <q>You
probably will not have discovered it for yourself. Robert Acton wants to
marry me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No, I had not discovered that. But I quite understand it. Why does it
make you unhappy?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Because I can't decide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Accept him, accept him!</q> cried Felix, joyously. <q>He is the best
fellow in the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He is immensely in love with me,</q> said the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And he has a large fortune. Permit me in turn to remind you of
that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, I am perfectly aware of it,</q> said Eugenia. <q>That 's a great
item in his favor. I am terribly candid.</q> And she left her place and
came nearer her brother, looking at him hard. He was turning over several
things; she was wondering in what manner he really understood her.</p>
            <p>There were several ways of understanding her: there was what she said,
and there was what she meant, and there was something, between the two,
that was neither. It is probable that, in the last analysis, what she meant
was that Felix should spare her the necessity of stating the case more
exactly and should hold himself commissioned to assist her by all honorable
means to marry the best fellow in the world. But in all this it was never
discovered what Felix understood.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Once you have your liberty, what are your objections?</q> he
asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I don't particularly like him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, try a little.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am trying now,</q> said Eugenia. <q>I should succeed better if he
did n't live here. I could never live here.</q>
               <pb n="1001"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Make him go to Europe,</q> Felix suggested.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, there you speak of happiness based upon violent effort,</q> the
Baroness rejoined. <q>That is not what I am looking for. He would never
live in Europe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He would live anywhere, with you!</q> said Felix, gallantly.</p>
            <p>His sister looked at him still, with a ray of penetration in her
charming eyes; then she turned away again. <q>You see, at all events,</q>
she presently went on, <q>that if it had been said of me that I had come
over here to seek my fortune it would have to be added that I have found
it!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't leave it lying!</q> urged Felix, with smiling solemnity.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am much obliged to you for your interest,</q> his sister declared,
after a moment. <q>But promise me one thing: pas de zèle! If Mr.
Acton should ask you to plead his cause, excuse yourself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall certainly have the excuse,</q> said Felix, <q>that I have a
cause of my own to plead.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If he should talk of me—favorably,</q> Eugenia continued,
<q>warn him against dangerous illusions. I detest importunities; I want to
decide at my leisure, with my eyes open.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall be discreet,</q> said Felix, <q>except to you. To you I will
say, Accept him outright.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She had advanced to the open door-way, and she stood looking at him.
<q>I will go and dress and think of it,</q> she said; and he heard her
moving slowly to her apartments.</p>
            <p>Late in the afternoon the rain stopped, and just afterwards there was a
great flaming, flickering, trickling sunset. Felix sat in his painting-room
and did some work; but at last, as the light, which had not been brilliant,
began to fade, he laid down his brushes and came out to the little piazza
of the cottage. Here he walked up and down for some time, looking at the
splendid blaze of the western sky and saying, as he had often said before,
that this was certainly the country of sunsets. There was something in
these glorious deeps of fire that quickened his imagination; he always
found images and promises in the western sky. He thought of a good many
things—of roaming about the world with Gertrude Wentworth; he seemed
to see their possible adventures, in a glowing frieze, between the
cloud-bars; then of what Eugenia had just been telling him. He wished very
much that Madame <pb n="1002"/>
Münster would make a comfortable and honorable marriage.
Presently, as the sunset expanded and deepened, the fancy took him of
making a note of so magnificent a piece of coloring. He returned to his
studio and fetched out a small panel, with his palette and brushes, and,
placing the panel against a window-sill, he began to daub with great gusto.
While he was so occupied he saw Mr. Brand, in the distance, slowly come
down from Mr. Wentworth's house, nursing a large folded umbrella. He walked
with a joyless, meditative tread, and his eyes were bent upon the ground.
Felix poised his brush for a moment, watching him; then, by a sudden
impulse, as he drew nearer, advanced to the garden-gate and signaled to
him—the palette and bunch of brushes contributing to this effect.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand stopped and started; then he appeared to decide to accept
Felix's invitation. He came out of Mr. Wentworth's gate and passed along
the road; after which he entered the little garden of the cottage. Felix
had gone back to his sunset; but he made his visitor welcome while he
rapidly brushed it in.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I wanted so much to speak to you that I thought I would call you,</q>
he said, in the friendliest tone. <q>All the more that you have been to see
me so little. You have come to see my sister; I know that. But you have n't
come to see me—the celebrated artist. Artists are very sensitive, you
know; they notice those things.</q> And Felix turned round, smiling, with a
brush in his mouth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand stood there with a certain blank, candid majesty, pulling
together the large flaps of his umbrella. <q>Why should I come to see
you?</q> he asked. <q>I know nothing of Art.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It would sound very conceited, I suppose,</q> said Felix, <q>if I
were to say that it would be a good little chance for you to learn
something. You would ask me why you should learn; and I should have no
answer to that. I suppose a minister has no need for Art, eh?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He has need for good temper, sir,</q> said Mr. Brand, with
decision.</p>
            <p>Felix jumped up, with his palette on his thumb and a movement of the
liveliest deprecation. <q>That 's because I keep you standing there while I
splash my red paint! I beg a thousand <pb n="1003"/>
pardons! You see what bad manners Art gives a man; and how
right you are to let it alone. I did n't mean you should stand, either. The
piazza, as you see, is ornamented with rustic chairs; though indeed I ought
to warn you that they have nails in the wrong places. I was just making a
note of that sunset. I never saw such a blaze of different reds. It looks
as if the Celestial City were in flames, eh? If that were really the case I
suppose it would be the business of you theologians to put out the fire.
Fancy me—an ungodly artist—quietly sitting down to paint
it!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand had always credited Felix Young with a certain impudence, but
it appeared to him that on this occasion his impudence was so great as to
make a special explanation—or even an apology—necessary. And
the impression, it must be added, was sufficiently natural. Felix had at
all times a brilliant assurance of manner which was simply the vehicle of
his good spirits and his good will; but at present he had a special design,
and as he would have admitted that the design was audacious, so he was
conscious of having summoned all the arts of conversation to his aid. But
he was so far from desiring to offend his visitor that he was rapidly
asking himself what personal compliment he could pay the young clergyman
that would gratify him most. If he could think of it, he was prepared to
pay it down. <q>Have you been preaching one of your beautiful sermons
to-day?</q> he suddenly asked, laying down his palette. This was not what
Felix had been trying to think of, but it was a tolerable stop-gap.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand frowned—as much as a man can frown who has very fair,
soft eyebrows, and, beneath them, very gentle, tranquil eyes. <q>No, I have
not preached any sermon to-day. Did you bring me over here for the purpose
of making that inquiry?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix saw that he was irritated, and he regretted it immensely; but he
had no fear of not being, in the end, agreeable to Mr. Brand. He looked at
him, smiling and laying his hand on his arm. <q>No, no, not for
that—not for that. I wanted to ask you something; I wanted to tell
you something. I am sure it will interest you very much. Only—as it
is something rather private—we had better come into my little studio.
I have a western window; we can still see the sunset. <pb n="1004"/>
Andiamo!</q> And he gave a little pat to his companion's arm.
</p>
            <p>He led the way in; Mr. Brand stiffly and softly followed. The twilight
had thickened in the little studio; but the wall opposite the western
window was covered with a deep pink flush. There were a great many sketches
and half-finished canvasses suspended in this rosy glow, and the corners of
the room were vague and dusky. Felix begged Mr. Brand to sit down; then
glancing round him, <q>By Jove, how pretty it looks!</q> he cried. But Mr.
Brand would not sit down; he went and leaned against the window; he
wondered what Felix wanted of him. In the shadow, on the darker parts of
the wall, he saw the gleam of three or four pictures that looked fantastic
and surprising. They seemed to represent naked figures. Felix stood there,
with his head a little bent and his eyes fixed upon his visitor, smiling
intensely, pulling his mustache. Mr. Brand felt vaguely uneasy. <q>It is
very delicate—what I want to say,</q> Felix began. <q>But I have been
thinking of it for some time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Please to say it as quickly as possible,</q> said Mr. Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's because you are a clergyman, you know,</q> Felix went on. <q>I
don't think I should venture to say it to a common man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand was silent a moment. <q>If it is a question of yielding to a
weakness, of resenting an injury, I am afraid I am a very common
man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dearest friend,</q> cried Felix, <q>this is not an injury; it 's a
benefit—a great service! You will like it extremely. Only it 's so
delicate!</q> And, in the dim light, he continued to smile intensely.
<q>You know I take a great interest in my cousins—in Charlotte and
Gertrude Wentworth. That 's very evident from my having traveled some five
thousand miles to see them.</q> Mr. Brand said nothing and Felix proceeded.
<q>Coming into their society as a perfect stranger I received of course a
great many new impressions, and my impressions had a great freshness, a
great keenness. Do you know what I mean?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not sure that I do; but I should like you to continue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think my impressions have always a good deal of freshness,</q>
               <pb n="1005"/>
said Mr. Brand's entertainer; <q>but on this occasion it was
perhaps particularly natural that—coming in, as I say, from
outside—I should be struck with things that passed unnoticed among
yourselves. And then I had my sister to help me; and she is simply the most
observant woman in the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not surprised,</q> said Mr. Brand, <q>that in our little circle
two intelligent persons should have found food for observation. I am sure
that, of late, I have found it myself!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, but I shall surprise you yet!</q> cried Felix, laughing. <q>Both
my sister and I took a great fancy to my cousin Charlotte.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your cousin Charlotte?</q> repeated Mr. Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We fell in love with her from the first!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You fell in love with Charlotte?</q> Mr. Brand murmured.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Dame!</q> exclaimed Felix, <q>she 's a very charming person; and
Eugenia was especially smitten.</q> Mr. Brand stood staring, and he
pursued, <q>Affection, you know, opens one's eyes, and we noticed
something. Charlotte is not happy! Charlotte is in love.</q> And Felix,
drawing nearer, laid his hand again upon his companion's arm.</p>
            <p>There was something akin to an acknowledgment of fascination in the way
Mr. Brand looked at him; but the young clergyman retained as yet quite
enough self-possession to be able to say, with a good deal of solemnity,
<q>She is not in love with you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix gave a light laugh, and rejoined with the alacrity of a maritime
adventurer who feels a puff of wind in his sail. <q>Ah, no; if she were in
love with me I should know it! I am not so blind as you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As I?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear sir, you are stone blind. Poor Charlotte is dead in love with
you!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand said nothing for a moment; he breathed a little heavily. <q>Is
that what you wanted to say to me?</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have wanted to say it these three weeks. Because of late she has
been worse. I told you,</q> added Felix, <q>it was very delicate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, sir</q>—Mr. Brand began; <q>well, sir</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was sure you did n't know it,</q> Felix continued. <q>But <pb n="1006"/>
don't you see—as soon as I mention it—how
everything is explained?</q> Mr. Brand answered nothing; he looked for a
chair and softly sat down. Felix could see that he was blushing; he had
looked straight at his host hitherto, but now he looked away. The foremost
effect of what he had heard had been a sort of irritation of his modesty.
<q>Of course,</q> said Felix, <q>I suggest nothing; it would be very
presumptuous in me to advise you. But I think there is no doubt about the
fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand looked hard at the floor for some moments; he was oppressed
with a mixture of sensations. Felix, standing there, was very sure that one
of them was profound surprise. The innocent young man had been completely
unsuspicious of poor Charlotte's hidden flame. This gave Felix great hope;
he was sure that Mr. Brand would be flattered. Felix thought him very
transparent, and indeed he was so; he could neither simulate nor
dissimulate. <q>I scarcely know what to make of this,</q> he said at last,
without looking up; and Felix was struck with the fact that he offered no
protest or contradiction. Evidently Felix had kindled a train of
memories—a retrospective illumination. It was making, to Mr. Brand's
astonished eyes, a very pretty blaze; his second emotion had been a
gratification of vanity.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thank me for telling you,</q> Felix rejoined. <q>It 's a good thing
to know.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not sure of that,</q> said Mr. Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, don't let her languish!</q> Felix murmured, lightly and
softly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You do advise me, then?</q> And Mr. Brand looked up.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I congratulate you!</q> said Felix, smiling. He had thought at first
his visitor was simply appealing; but he saw he was a little ironical.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is in your interest; you have interfered with me,</q> the young
clergyman went on.</p>
            <p>Felix still stood and smiled. The little room had grown darker, and the
crimson glow had faded; but Mr. Brand could see the brilliant expression of
his face. <q>I won't pretend not to know what you mean,</q> said Felix at
last. <q>But I have not really interfered with you. Of what you had to
lose—with another person—you have lost nothing. And think what
you have gained!</q>
               <pb n="1007"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It seems to me I am the proper judge, on each side,</q>
Mr. Brand declared. He got up, holding the brim of his hat against his
mouth and staring at Felix through the dusk.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have lost an illusion!</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What do you call an illusion?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The belief that you really know—that you have ever really
known—Gertrude Wentworth. Depend upon that,</q> pursued Felix. <q>I
don't know her yet; but I have no illusions; I don't pretend to.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand kept gazing, over his hat. <q>She has always been a lucid,
limpid nature,</q> he said, solemnly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She has always been a dormant nature. She was waiting for a
touchstone. But now she is beginning to awaken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't praise her to me!</q> said Mr. Brand, with a little quaver in
his voice. <q>If you have the advantage of me that is not generous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear sir, I am melting with generosity!</q> exclaimed Felix.
<q>And I am not praising my cousin. I am simply attempting a scientific
definition of her. She doesn't care for abstractions. Now I think the
contrary is what you have always fancied—is the basis on which you
have been building. She is extremely preoccupied with the concrete. I care
for the concrete, too. But Gertrude is stronger than I; she whirls me
along!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand looked for a moment into the crown of his hat. <q>It 's a most
interesting nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So it is,</q> said Felix. <q>But it pulls—it pulls—like a
runaway horse. Now I like the feeling of a runaway horse; and if I am
thrown out of the vehicle it is no great matter. But if you should be
thrown, Mr. Brand</q>—and Felix paused a moment—<q>another
person also would suffer from the accident.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What other person?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Charlotte Wentworth!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand looked at Felix for a moment sidewise, mistrustfully; then his
eyes slowly wandered over the ceiling. Felix was sure he was secretly
struck with the romance of the situation. <q>I think this is none of our
business,</q> the young minister murmured.</p>
            <p>
               <q>None of mine, perhaps; but surely yours!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand lingered still, looking at the ceiling; there was <pb n="1008"/>
evidently something he wanted to say. <q>What do you mean by
Miss Gertrude being strong?</q> he asked abruptly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> said Felix meditatively, <q>I mean that she has had a great
deal of self-possession. She was waiting—for years; even when she
seemed, perhaps, to be living in the present. She knew how to wait; she had
a purpose. That 's what I mean by her being strong.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But what do you mean by her purpose?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well—the purpose to see the world!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand eyed his strange informant askance again; but he said nothing.
At last he turned away, as if to take leave. He seemed bewildered, however;
for instead of going to the door he moved toward the opposite corner of the
room. Felix stood and watched him for a moment—almost groping about
in the dusk; then he led him to the door, with a tender, almost fraternal
movement. <q>Is that all you have to say?</q> asked Mr. Brand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, it 's all—but it will bear a good deal of thinking
of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix went with him to the garden-gate, and watched him slowly walk away
into the thickening twilight with a relaxed rigidity that tried to rectify
itself. <q>He is offended, excited, bewildered, perplexed—and
enchanted!</q> Felix said to himself. <q>That 's a capital
mixture.</q>

            <p>Since that visit paid by the Baroness Münster to Mrs. Acton, of
which some account was given at an earlier stage of this narrative, the
intercourse between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor
intimate. It was not that Mrs. Acton had failed to appreciate Madame
Münster's charms; on the contrary, her perception of the graces of
manner and conversation of her brilliant visitor had been only too acute.
Mrs. Acton was, as they said in Boston, very <q>intense,</q> and her
impressions were apt to be too many for her. The state of her health
required the restriction of emotion; and this is why, receiving, as she sat
in her eternal arm-chair, very few visitors, even of the soberest local
type, she had been obliged to limit the number of her interviews with a
lady whose costume and manner recalled to her imagination—Mrs.
Acton's imagination was a marvel—all that she had ever read of the
most stirring historical periods. But she had sent the Baroness a great
many quaintly-worded messages and a great many nosegays from her garden and
baskets of beautiful fruit. Felix had eaten the fruit, and the Baroness had
arranged the flowers and returned the baskets and the messages. On the day
that followed that rainy Sunday of which mention has been made, Eugenia
determined to go and pay the beneficent invalid a <q>visite d'adieux;</q>
so it was that, to herself, she qualified her enterprise. It may be noted
that neither on the Sunday evening nor on the Monday morning had she
received that expected visit from Robert Acton. To his own consciousness,
evidently he was <q>keeping away;</q> and as the Baroness, on her side, was
keeping away from her uncle's, whither, for several days, Felix had been
the unembarrassed bearer of apologies and regrets for absence, chance had
not taken the cards from the hands of design. Mr. Wentworth and his
daughters had respected Eugenia's seclusion; certain intervals of
mysterious retirement appeared to them, vaguely, a natural part of the
graceful, rhythmic movement of so remarkable a life. Gertrude especially
held these periods in honor; she wondered what Madame Münster did at
such times, but she would not have permitted herself to inquire too
curiously.<pb n="1010"/>
            </p>
            <p>The long rain had freshened the air, and twelve hours'
brilliant sunshine had dried the roads; so that the Baroness, in the late
afternoon, proposing to walk to Mrs. Acton's, exposed herself to no great
discomfort. As with her charming undulating step she moved along the clean,
grassy margin of the road, beneath the thickly-hanging boughs of the
orchards, through the quiet of the hour and place and the rich maturity of
the summer, she was even conscious of a sort of luxurious melancholy. The
Baroness had the amiable weakness of attaching herself to places—even
when she had begun with a little aversion; and now, with the prospect of
departure, she felt tenderly toward this well-wooded corner of the Western
world, where the sunsets were so beautiful and one's ambitions were so
pure. Mrs. Acton was able to receive her; but on entering this lady's
large, freshly-scented room the Baroness saw that she was looking very ill.
She was wonderfully white and transparent, and, in her flowered arm-chair,
she made no attempt to move. But she flushed a little—like a young
girl, the Baroness thought—and she rested her clear, smiling eyes
upon those of her visitor. Her voice was low and monotonous, like a voice
that had never expressed any human passions.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have come to bid you good-by,</q> said Eugenia. <q>I shall soon be
going away.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When are you going away?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Very soon—any day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am very sorry,</q> said Mrs. Acton. <q>I hoped you would
stay—always.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Always?</q> Eugenia demanded.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I mean a long time,</q> said Mrs. Acton, in her sweet, feeble
tone. <q>They tell me you are so comfortable—that you have got such a
beautiful little house.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia stared—that is, she smiled; she thought of her poor little
chalet and she wondered whether her hostess were jesting. <q>Yes, my house
is exquisite,</q> she said; <q>though not to be compared to yours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And my son is so fond of going to see you,</q> Mrs. Acton added. <q>I
am afraid my son will miss you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, dear madame,</q> said Eugenia, with a little laugh, <q>I can't
stay in America for your son!</q>
               <pb n="1011"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Don't you like America?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness looked at the front of her dress. <q>If I liked
it—that would not be staying for your son!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Acton gazed at her with her grave, tender eyes, as if she had not
quite understood. The Baroness at last found something irritating in the
sweet, soft stare of her hostess; and if one were not bound to be merciful
to great invalids she would almost have taken the liberty of pronouncing
her, mentally, a fool. <q>I am afraid, then, I shall never see you
again,</q> said Mrs. Acton. <q>You know I am dying.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, dear madame,</q> murmured Eugenia.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I want to leave my children cheerful and happy. My daughter will
probably marry her cousin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Two such interesting young people,</q> said the Baroness, vaguely.
She was not thinking of Clifford Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I feel so tranquil about my end,</q> Mrs. Acton went on. <q>It is
coming so easily, so surely.</q> And she paused, with her mild gaze always
on Eugenia's.</p>
            <p>The Baroness hated to be reminded of death; but even in its imminence,
so far as Mrs. Acton was concerned, she preserved her good manners. <q>Ah,
madame, you are too charming an invalid,</q> she rejoined.</p>
            <p>But the delicacy of this rejoinder was apparently lost upon her hostess,
who went on in her low, reasonable voice. <q>I want to leave my children
bright and comfortable. You seem to me all so happy here—just as you
are. So I wish you could stay. It would be so pleasant for Robert.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia wondered what she meant by its being pleasant for Robert; but
she felt that she would never know what such a woman as that meant. She got
up; she was afraid Mrs. Acton would tell her again that she was dying.
<q>Good-by, dear madame,</q> she said. <q>I must remember that your
strength is precious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Acton took her hand and held it a moment. <q>Well, you have been
happy here, have n't you? And you like us all, don't you? I wish you would
stay,</q> she added, <q>in your beautiful little house.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She had told Eugenia that her waiting-woman would be in the hall, to
show her down-stairs; but the large landing outside her door was empty, and
Eugenia stood there looking <pb n="1012"/>
about. She felt irritated; the dying lady had not <q>la main
heureuse.</q> She passed slowly down-stairs, still looking about. The broad
staircase made a great bend, and in the angle was a high window, looking
westward, with a deep bench, covered with a row of flowering plants in
curious old pots of blue chin a-ware. The yellow afternoon light came in
through the flowers and flickered a little on the white wainscots. Eugenia
paused a moment; the house was perfectly still, save for the ticking,
somewhere, of a great clock. The lower hall stretched away at the foot of
the stairs, half covered over with a large Oriental rug. Eugenia lingered a
little, noticing a great many things. <q>Comme c'est bien!</q> she said to
herself; such a large, solid, irreproachable basis of existence the place
seemed to her to indicate. And then she reflected that Mrs. Acton was soon
to withdraw from it. The reflection accompanied her the rest of the way
down-stairs, where she paused again, making more observations. The hall was
extremely broad, and on either side of the front door was a wide,
deeply-set window, which threw the shadows of everything back into the
house. There were high-backed chairs along the wall and big Eastern vases
upon tables, and, on either side, a large cabinet with a glass front and
little curiosities within, dimly gleaming. The doors were open—into
the darkened parlor, the library, the dining-room. All these rooms seemed
empty. Eugenia passed along, and stopped a moment on the threshold of each.
<q>Comme c'est bien!</q> she murmured again; she had thought of just such a
house as this when she decided to come to America. She opened the front
door for herself—her light tread had summoned none of the
servants—and on the threshold she gave a last look.  Outside, she was
still in the humor for curious contemplation; so instead of going directly
down the little drive, to the gate, she wandered away towards the garden,
which lay to the right of the house. She had not gone many yards over the
grass before she paused quickly; she perceived a gentleman stretched upon
the level verdure, beneath a tree. He had not heard her coming, and he lay
motionless, flat on his back, with his hands clasped under his head,
staring up at the sky; so that the Baroness was able to reflect, at her
leisure, upon the question of his identity. It was that of a person who had
lately been much in her thoughts; but her first impulse, <pb n="1013"/>
nevertheless, was to turn away; the last thing she desired was
to have the air of coming in quest of Robert Acton. The gentleman on the
grass, however, gave her no time to decide; he could not long remain
unconscious of so agreeable a presence. He rolled back his eyes, stared,
gave an exclamation, and then jumped up. He stood an instant, looking at
her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Excuse my ridiculous position,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have just now no sense of the ridiculous. But, in case you have,
don't imagine I came to see you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Take care,</q> rejoined Acton, <q>how you put it into my head! I was
thinking of you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The occupation of extreme leisure!</q> said the Baroness. <q>To think
of a woman when you are in that position is no compliment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I did n't say I was thinking well!</q> Acton affirmed, smiling.</p>
            <p>She looked at him, and then she turned away.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Though I did n't come to see you,</q> she said, <q>remember at least
that I am within your gates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am delighted—I am honored! Won't you come into the
house?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have just come out of it. I have been calling upon your mother. I
have been bidding her farewell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Farewell?</q> Acton demanded.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am going away,</q> said the Baroness. And she turned away again, as
if to illustrate her meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When are you going?</q> asked Acton, standing a moment in his place.
But the Baroness made no answer, and he followed her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I came this way to look at your garden,</q> she said, walking back to
the gate, over the grass. <q>But I must go.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let me at least go with you.</q> He went with her, and they said
nothing till they reached the gate. It was open, and they looked down the
road which was darkened over with long bosky shadows. <q>Must you go
straight home?</q> Acton asked.</p>
            <p>But she made no answer. She said, after a moment, <q>Why have you not
been to see me?</q> He said nothing, and then she went on, <q>Why don't you
answer me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am trying to invent an answer,</q> Acton confessed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Have you none ready?</q>
               <pb n="1014"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>None that I can tell you,</q> he said. <q>But let me
walk with you now.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You may do as you like.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She moved slowly along the road, and Acton went with her. Presently he
said, <q>If I had done as I liked I would have come to see you several
times.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Is that invented?</q> asked Eugenia.</p>
            <p>
               <q>No, that is natural. I stayed away because</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, here comes the reason, then!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Because I wanted to think about you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Because you wanted to lie down!</q> said the Baroness. <q>I have seen
you lie down—almost—in my drawing-room.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton stopped in the road, with a movement which seemed to beg her to
linger a little. She paused, and he looked at her awhile; he thought her
very charming. <q>You are jesting,</q> he said; <q>but if you are really
going away it is very serious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If I stay,</q> and she gave a little laugh, <q>it is more serious
still!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When shall you go?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As soon as possible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And why?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why should I stay?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Because we all admire you so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is not a reason. I am admired also in Europe.</q> And she began
to walk homeward again.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What could I say to keep you?</q> asked Acton. He wanted to keep her,
and it was a fact that he had been thinking of her for a week. He was in
love with her now; he was conscious of that, or he thought he was; and the
only question with him was whether he could trust her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What you can say to keep me?</q> she repeated. <q>As I want very much
to go it is not in my interest to tell you. Besides, I can't
imagine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He went on with her in silence; he was much more affected by what she
had told him than appeared. Ever since that evening of his return from
Newport her image had had a terrible power to trouble him. What Clifford
Wentworth had told him—that had affected him, too, in an adverse
sense; but it had not liberated him from the discomfort of a charm of which
his intelligence was impatient. <q>She is not honest, she <pb n="1015"/>
is not honest,</q> he kept murmuring to himself. That is what
he had been saying to the summer sky, ten minutes before. Unfortunately, he
was unable to say it fin ally, definitively; and now that he was near her
it seemed to matter wonderfully little. <q>She is a woman who will lie,</q>
he had said to himself. Now, as he went along, he reminded himself of this
observation; but it failed to frighten him as it had done before. He almost
wished he could make her lie and then convict her of it, so that he might
see how he should like that. He kept thinking of this as he walked by her
side, while she moved forward with her light, graceful dignity. He had sat
with her before; he had driven with her; but he had never walked with
her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>By Jove, how comme il faut she is!</q> he said, as he observed her
sidewise. When they reached the cottage in the orchard she passed into the
gate without asking him to follow; but she turned round, as he stood there,
to bid him good-night.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I asked you a question the other night which you never answered,</q>
he said. <q>Have you sent off that document—liberating
yourself?</q>
            </p>
            <p>She hesitated for a single moment—very naturally. Then,
<q>Yes,</q> she said, simply.</p>
            <p>He turned away; he wondered whether that would do for his lie. But he
saw her again that evening, for the Baroness reappeared at her uncle's. He
had little talk with her, however; two gentlemen had driven out from
Boston, in a buggy, to call upon Mr. Wentworth and his daughters, and
Madame Münster was an object of absorbing interest to both of the
visitors. One of them, indeed, said nothing to her; he only sat and watched
with intense gravity, and leaned forward solemnly, presenting his ear (a
very large one), as if he were deaf, whenever she dropped an observation.
He had evidently been impressed with the idea of  her misfortunes and
reverses: he never smiled. His companion adopted a lighter, easier style;
sat as near as possible to Madame Münster; attempted to draw her out,
and proposed every few moments a new topic of conversation. Eugenia was
less vividly responsive than usual and had less to say than, from her
brilliant reputation, her interlocutor expected, upon the relative merits
of European and American institutions; but she was inaccessible <pb n="1016"/>
to Robert Acton, who roamed about the piazza with his hands in
his pockets, listening for the grating sound of the buggy from Boston, as
it should be brought round to the side-door. But he listened in vain, and
at last he lost patience. His sister came to him and begged him to take her
home, and he presently went off with her. Eugenia observed him leaving the
house with Lizzie; in her present mood the fact seemed a contribution to
her irritated conviction that he had several precious qualities. <q>Even
that mal-élevée little girl,</q> she reflected, <q>makes him
do what she wishes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She had been sitting just within one of the long windows that opened
upon the piazza; but very soon after Acton had gone away she got up
abruptly, just when the talkative gentleman from Boston was asking her what
she thought of the <q>moral tone</q> of that city. On the piazza she
encountered Clifford Wentworth, coming round from the other side of the
house. She stopped him; she told him she wished to speak to him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why did n't you go home with your cousin?</q> she asked.</p>
            <p>Clifford stared. <q>Why, Robert has taken her,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Exactly so. But you don't usually leave that to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh,</q> said Clifford, <q>I want to see those fellows start off. They
don't know how to drive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not, then, that you have quarreled with your cousin?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Clifford reflected a moment, and then with a simplicity which had, for
the Baroness, a singularly baffling quality, <q>Oh, no; we have made
up!</q> he said.</p>
            <p>She looked at him for some moments; but Clifford had begun to be afraid
of the Baroness's looks, and he endeavored, now, to shift himself out of
their range. <q>Why do you never come to see me any more?</q> she asked.
<q>Have I displeased you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Displeased me? Well, I guess not!</q> said Clifford, with a
laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why have n't you come, then?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, because I am afraid of getting shut up in that back
room.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eugenia kept looking at him. <q>I should think you would like
that.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Like it!</q> cried Clifford.<pb n="1017"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should, if I were a young man calling upon a charming
woman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A charming woman is n't much use to me when I am shut up in that back
room!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am afraid I am not of much use to you anywhere!</q> said Madame
Münster. <q>And yet you know how I have offered to be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> observed Clifford, by way of response, <q>there comes the
buggy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Never mind the buggy. Do you know I am going away?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you mean now?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I mean in a few days. I leave this place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are going back to Europe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To Europe, where you are to come and see me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, yes, I 'll come out there,</q> said Clifford.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But before that,</q> Eugenia declared, <q>you must come and see me
here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, I shall keep clear of that back room!</q> rejoined her simple
young kinsman.</p>
            <p>The Baroness was silent a moment. <q>Yes, you must come
frankly—boldly. That will be very much better. I see that
now.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I see it!</q> said Clifford. And then, in an instant, <q>What 's the
matter with that buggy?</q> His practiced ear had apparently detected an
unnatural creak in the wheels of the light vehicle which had been brought
to the portico, and he hurried away to investigate so grave an anomaly.</p>
            <p>The Baroness walked homeward, alone, in the starlight, asking herself a
question. Was she to have gained nothing—was she to have gained
nothing?</p>
            <p>Gertrude Wentworth had held a silent place in the little circle gathered
about the two gentlemen from Boston. She was not interested in the
visitors; she was watching Madame Münster, as she constantly watched
her. She knew that Eugenia also was not interested—that she was
bored; and Gertrude was absorbed in study of the problem how, in spite of
her indifference and her absent attention, she managed to have such a
charming manner. That was the manner Gertrude would have liked to have; she
determined to cultivate it, and she wished that—to give her the
charm—she might in future <pb n="1018"/>
very often be bored. While she was engaged in these
researches, Felix Young was looking for Charlotte, to whom he had something
to say. For some time, now, he had had something to say to Charlotte, and
this evening his sense of the propriety of holding some special
conversation with her had reached the motive-point—resolved itself
into acute and delightful desire. He wandered through the empty rooms on
the large ground-floor of the house, and found her at last in a small
apartment denominated, for reasons not immediately apparent, Mr.
Wentworth's <q>office:</q> an extremely neat and well-dusted room, with an
array of law-books, in time-darkened sheep-skin, on one of the walls; a
large map of the United States on the other, flanked on either side by an
old steel engraving of one of Raphael's Madonnas; and on the third several
glass cases containing specimens of butterflies and beetles. Charlotte was
sitting by a lamp, embroidering a slipper. Felix did not ask for whom the
slipper was destined; he saw it was very large.</p>
            <p>He moved a chair toward her and sat down, smiling as usual, but, at
first, not speaking. She watched him, with her needle poised, and with a
certain shy, fluttered look which she always wore when he approached her.
There was something in Felix's manner that quickened her modesty, her
self-consciousness; if absolute choice had been given her she would have
preferred never to find herself alone with him; and in fact, though she
thought him a most brilliant, distinguished, and well-meaning person, she
had exercised a much larger amount of tremulous tact than he had ever
suspected, to circumvent the accident of tête-à-tête.
Poor Charlotte could have given no account of the matter that would not
have seemed unjust both to herself and to her foreign kinsman; she could
only have said—or rather, she would never have said it—that she
did not like so much gentleman's society at once. She was not reassured,
accordingly, when he began, emphasizing his words with a kind of admiring
radiance, <q>My dear cousin, I am enchanted at finding you alone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am very often alone,</q> Charlotte observed. Then she quickly
added, <q>I don't mean I am lonely!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So clever a woman as you is never lonely,</q> said Felix. <pb n="1019"/>
               <q>You have company in your beautiful work.</q> And he glanced
at the big slipper.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I like to work,</q> declared Charlotte, simply.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So do I!</q> said her companion. <q>And I like to idle too. But it is
not to idle that I have come in search of you. I want to tell you something
very particular.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> murmured Charlotte; <q>of course, if you
must</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear cousin,</q> said Felix, <q>it 's nothing that a young lady
may not listen to. At least I suppose it is n't. But voyons; you shall
judge. I am terribly in love.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, Felix,</q> began Miss Wentworth, gravely. But her very gravity
appeared to check the development of her phrase.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am in love with your sister; but in love, Charlotte—in
love!</q> the young man pursued. Charlotte had laid her work in her lap;
her hands were tightly folded on top of it; she was staring at the carpet.
<q>In short, I 'm in love, dear lady,</q> said Felix. <q>Now I want you to
help me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To help you?</q> asked Charlotte, with a tremor.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't mean with Gertrude; she and I have a perfect understanding;
and oh, how well she understands one! I mean with your father and with the
world in general, including Mr. Brand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Poor Mr. Brand!</q> said Charlotte, slowly, but with a simplicity
which made it evident to Felix that the young minister had not repeated to
Miss Wentworth the talk that had lately occurred between them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, now, don't say `poor' Mr. Brand! I don't pity Mr. Brand at all.
But I pity your father a little, and I don't want to displease him.
Therefore, you see, I want you to plead for me. You don't think me very
shabby, eh?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Shabby?</q> exclaimed Charlotte softly, for whom Felix represented
the most polished and iridescent qualities of mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't mean in my appearance,</q> rejoined Felix, laughing; for
Charlotte was looking at his boots. <q>I mean in my conduct. You don't
think it 's an abuse of hospitality?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To—to care for Gertrude?</q> asked Charlotte.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To have really expressed one's self. Because I have expressed myself,
Charlotte; I must tell you the whole truth—I have! Of course I want
to marry her—and here is the difficulty. <pb n="1020"/>
I held off as long as I could; but she is such a terribly
fascinating person! She 's a strange creature, Charlotte; I don't believe
you really know her.</q> Charlotte took up her tapestry again, and again
she laid it down. <q>I know your father has had higher views,</q> Felix
continued; <q>and I think you have shared them. You have wanted to marry
her to Mr. Brand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, no,</q> said Charlotte, very earnestly. <q>Mr. Brand has always
admired her. But we did not want anything of that kind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix stared. <q>Surely, marriage was what you proposed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes; but we did n't wish to force her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A la bonne heure! That 's very unsafe you know. With these arranged
marriages there is often the deuce to pay.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, Felix,</q> said Charlotte, <q>we did n't want to `arrange.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am delighted to hear that. Because in such cases—even when
the woman is a thoroughly good creature—she can't help looking for a
compensation. A charming fellow comes along—and voilà!</q>
Charlotte sat mutely staring at the floor, and Felix presently added, <q>Do
go on with your slipper, I like to see you work.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte took up her variegated canvas, and began to draw vague blue
stitches in a big round rose. <q>If Gertrude is so—so strange,</q>
she said, <q>why do you want to marry her?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, that 's it, dear Charlotte! I like strange women; I always have
liked them. Ask Eugenia! And Gertrude is wonderful; she says the most
beautiful things!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte looked at him, almost for the first time, as if her meaning
required to be severely pointed. <q>You have a great influence over
her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes—and no!</q> said Felix. <q>I had at first, I think; but now
it is six of one and half-a-dozen of the other; it is reciprocal. She
affects me strongly—for she is so strong. I don't believe you know
her; it 's a beautiful nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, yes, Felix; I have always thought Gertrude's nature
beautiful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, if you think so now,</q> cried the young man, <q>wait and see!
She 's a folded flower. Let me pluck her from the parent tree and you will
see her expand. I 'm sure you will enjoy it.</q>
               <pb n="1021"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't understand you,</q> murmured Charlotte. <q>I
can't, Felix.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, you can understand this—that I beg you to say a good word
for me to your father. He regards me, I naturally believe, as a very light
fellow, a Bohemian, an irregular character. Tell him I am not all this; if
I ever was, I have forgotten it. I am fond of pleasure—yes; but of
innocent pleasure. Pain is all one; but in pleasure, you know, there are
tremendous distinctions. Say to him that Gertrude is a folded flower and
that I am a serious man!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte got up from her chair slowly rolling up her work. <q>We know
you are very kind to every one, Felix,</q> she said. <q>But we are
extremely sorry for Mr. Brand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Of course you are—you especially! Because,</q> added Felix
hastily, <q>you are a woman. But I don't pity him. It ought to be enough
for any man that you take an interest in him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not enough for Mr. Brand,</q> said Charlotte, simply. And she
stood there a moment, as if waiting conscientiously for anything more that
Felix might have to say.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. Brand is not so keen about his marriage as he was,</q> he
presently said. <q>He is afraid of your sister. He begins to think she is
wicked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte looked at him now with beautiful, appealing eyes—eyes
into which he saw the tears rising. <q>Oh, Felix, Felix,</q> she cried,
<q>what have you done to her?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think she was asleep; I have waked her up!</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Charlotte, apparently, was really crying, she walked straight out of
the room. And Felix, standing there and meditating, had the apparent
brutality to take satisfaction in her tears.</p>
            <p>Late that night Gertrude, silent and serious, came to him in the garden;
it was a kind of appointment. Gertrude seemed to like appointments. She
plucked a handful of heliotrope and stuck it into the front of her dress,
but she said nothing. They walked together along one of the paths, and
Felix looked at the great, square, hospitable house, massing itself vaguely
in the starlight, with all its windows darkened.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have a little of a bad conscience,</q> he said. <q>I ought n't to
meet you this way till I have got your father's consent.</q>
               <pb n="1022"/>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at him for some time. <q>I don't understand
you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You very often say that,</q> he said. <q>Considering how little we
understand each other, it is a wonder how well we get on!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We have done nothing but meet since you came here—but meet
alone. The first time I ever saw you we were alone,</q> Gertrude went on.
<q>What is the difference now? Is it because it is at night?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The difference, Gertrude,</q> said Felix, stopping in the path,
<q>the difference is that I love you more—more than before!</q> And
then they stood there, talking, in the warm stillness and in front of the
closed dark house. <q>I have been talking to Charlotte—been trying to
bespeak her interest with your father. She has a kind of sublime
perversity; was ever a woman so bent upon cutting off her own head?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are too careful,</q> said Gertrude; <q>you are too
diplomatic.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> cried the young man, <q>I did n't come here to make any one
unhappy!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked round her awhile in the odorous darkness. <q>I will do
anything you please,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For instance?</q> asked Felix, smiling.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I will go away. I will do anything you please.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix looked at her in solemn admiration. <q>Yes, we will go away,</q>
he said. <q>But we will make peace first.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked about her again, and then she broke out, passionately,
<q>Why do they try to make one feel guilty? Why do they make it so
difficult? Why can't they understand?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I will make them understand!</q> said Felix. He drew her hand into
his arm, and they wandered about in the garden, talking, for an
hour.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="12" type="chapter">
            <head>Chapter 12</head>
            <pb n="1023"/>
            <p>Felix allowed Charlotte time to plead his cause; and then, on the third
day, he sought an interview with his uncle. It was in the morning; Mr.
Wentworth was in his office; and, on going in, Felix found that Charlotte
was at that moment in conference with her father. She had, in fact, been
constantly near him since her interview with Felix; she had made up her
mind that it was her duty to repeat very literally her cousin's passionate
plea. She had accordingly followed Mr. Wentworth about like a shadow, in
order to find him at hand when she should have mustered sufficient
composure to speak. For poor Charlotte, in this matter, naturally lacked
composure; especially when she meditated upon some of Felix's intimations.
It was not cheerful work, at the best, to keep giving small hammer-taps to
the coffin in which one had laid away, for burial, the poor little
unacknowledged offspring of one's own misbehaving heart; and the occupation
was not rendered more agreeable by the fact that the ghost of one's stifled
dream had been summoned from the shades by the strange, bold words of a
talkative young foreigner. What had Felix meant by saying that Mr. Brand
was not so keen? To herself her sister's justly depressed suitor had shown
no sign of faltering. Charlotte trembled all over when she allowed herself
to believe for an instant now and then that, privately, Mr. Brand might
have faltered; and as it seemed to give more force to Felix's words to
repeat them to her father, she was waiting until she should have taught
herself to be very calm. But she had now begun to tell Mr. Wentworth that
she was extremely anxious. She was proceeding to develop this idea, to
enumerate the objects of her anxiety, when Felix came in.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth sat there, with his legs crossed, lifting his dry, pure
countenance from the Boston <q>Advertiser.</q> Felix entered smiling, as if
he had something particular to say, and his uncle looked at him as if he
both expected and deprecated this event. Felix vividly expressing himself
had come to be a formidable figure to his uncle, who had not yet arrived at
definite views as to a proper tone. For the first time in his life, as I
have said, Mr. Wentworth shirked a responsibility; he <pb n="1024"/>
earnestly desired that it might not be laid upon him to
determine how his nephew's lighter propositions should be treated. He lived
under an apprehension that Felix might yet beguile him into assent to
doubtful inductions, and his conscience instructed him that the best form
of vigilance was the avoidance of discussion. He hoped that the pleasant
episode of his nephew's visit would pass away without a further lapse of
consistency.</p>
            <p>Felix looked at Charlotte with an air of understanding, and then at Mr.
Wentworth, and then at Charlotte again. Mr. Wentworth bent his refined
eyebrows upon his nephew and stroked down the first page of the
<q>Advertiser.</q> 
               <q>I ought to have brought a bouquet,</q> said Felix,
laughing. <q>In France they always do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We are not in France,</q> observed Mr. Wentworth, gravely, while
Charlotte earnestly gazed at him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>No, luckily, we are not in France, where I am afraid I should have a
harder time of it. My dear Charlotte, have you rendered me that delightful
service?</q> And Felix bent toward her as if some one had been presenting
him.</p>
            <p>Charlotte looked at him with almost frightened eyes; and Mr. Wentworth
thought this might be the beginning of a discussion. <q>What is the bouquet
for?</q> he inquired, by way of turning it off.</p>
            <p>Felix gazed at him, smiling. <q>Pour la demande!</q> And then, drawing
up a chair, he seated himself, hat in hand, with a kind of conscious
solemnity.</p>
            <p>Presently he turned to Charlotte again. <q>My good Charlotte, my
admirable Charlotte,</q> he murmured, <q>you have not played me
false—you have not sided against me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte got up, trembling extremely, though imperceptibly. <q>You must
speak to my father yourself,</q> she said. <q>I think you are clever
enough.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Felix, rising too, begged her to remain. <q>I can speak better to an
audience!</q> he declared.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I hope it is nothing disagreeable,</q> said Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's something delightful, for me!</q> And Felix, laying down his
hat, clasped his hands a little between his knees. <q>My dear uncle,</q> he
said, <q>I desire, very earnestly, to marry your daughter Gertrude.</q>
Charlotte sank slowly into her chair <pb n="1025"/>
again, and Mr. Wentworth sat staring, with a light in his face
that might have been flashed back from an iceberg. He stared and stared; he
said nothing. Felix fell back, with his hands still clasped.
<q>Ah—you don't like it. I was afraid!</q> He blushed deeply, and
Charlotte noticed it—remarking to herself that it was the first time
she had ever seen him blush. She began to blush herself and to reflect that
he might be much in love.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This is very abrupt,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, at last.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Have you never suspected it, dear uncle?</q> Felix inquired. <q>Well,
that proves how discreet I have been. Yes, I thought you would n't like
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is very serious, Felix,</q> said Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You think it 's an abuse of hospitality!</q> exclaimed Felix, smiling
again.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Of hospitality?—an abuse?</q> his uncle repeated very
slowly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That is what Felix said to me,</q> said Charlotte,
conscientiously.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Of course you think so; don't defend yourself!</q> Felix pursued.
<q>It is an abuse, obviously; the most I can claim is that it is perhaps a
pardonable one. I simply fell head over heels in love; one can hardly help
that. Though you are Gertrude's progenitor I don't believe you know how
attractive she is. Dear uncle, she contains the elements of a
singularly—I may say a strangely—charming woman!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She has always been to me an object of extreme concern,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth. <q>We have always desired her happiness.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, here it is!</q> Felix declared. <q>I will make her happy. She
believes it, too. Now had n't you noticed that?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I had noticed that she was much changed,</q> Mr. Wentworth declared,
in a tone whose unexpressive, unimpassioned quality appeared to Felix to
reveal a profundity of opposition. <q>It may be that she is only becoming
what you call a charming woman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Gertrude, at heart, is so earnest, so true,</q> said Charlotte, very
softly, fastening her eyes upon her father.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I delight to hear you praise her!</q> cried Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>She has a very peculiar temperament,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth.<pb n="1026"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Eh, even that is praise!</q> Felix rejoined. <q>I know I
am not the man you might have looked for. I have no position and no
fortune; I can give Gertrude no place in the world. A place in the
world—that 's what she ought to have; that would bring her
out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A place to do her duty!</q> remarked Mr. Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, how charmingly she does it—her duty!</q> Felix exclaimed,
with a radiant face. <q>What an exquisite conception she has of it! But she
comes honestly by that, dear uncle.</q> Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte both
looked at him as if they were watching a greyhound doubling. <q>Of course
with me she will hide her light under a bushel,</q> he continued; <q>I
being the bushel! Now I know you like me—you have certainly proved
it. But you think I am frivolous and penniless and shabby!
Granted—granted—a thousand times granted. I have been a loose
fish—a fiddler, a painter, an actor. But there is this to be said: In
the first place, I fancy you exaggerate; you lend me qualities I have n't
had. I have been a Bohemian—yes; but in Bohemia I always passed for a
gentleman. I wish you could see some of my old camarades—they would
tell you! It was the liberty I liked, but not the opportunities! My sins
were all peccadilloes; I always respected my neighbor's property—my
neighbor's wife. Do you see, dear uncle?</q> Mr. Wentworth ought to have
seen; his cold blue eyes were intently fixed. <q>And then, c'est fini! It
's all over. Je me range. I have settled down to a jog-trot. I find I can
earn my living—a very fair one—by going about the world and
painting bad portraits. It 's not a glorious profession, but it is a
perfectly respectable one. You won't deny that, eh? Going about the world,
I say? I must not deny that, for that I am afraid I shall always
do—in quest of agreeable sitters. When I say agreeable, I mean
susceptible of delicate flattery and prompt of payment. Gertrude declares
she is willing to share my wanderings and help to pose my models. She even
thinks it will be charming; and that brings me to my third point. Gertrude
likes me. Encourage her a little and she will tell you so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix's tongue obviously moved much faster than the imagination of his
auditors; his eloquence, like the rocking of a boat in a deep, smooth lake,
made long eddies of silence. And <pb n="1027"/>
he seemed to be pleading and chattering still, with his
brightly eager smile, his uplifted eyebrows, his expressive mouth, after he
had ceased speaking, and while, with his glance quickly turning from the
father to the daughter, he sat waiting for the effect of his appeal. <q>It
is not your want of means,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, after a period of severe
reticence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now it 's delightful of you to say that! Only don't say it 's my want
of character. Because I have a character—I assure you I have; a small
one, a little slip of a thing, but still something tangible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ought you not to tell Felix that it is Mr. Brand, father?</q>
Charlotte asked, with infinite mildness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not only Mr. Brand,</q> Mr. Wentworth solemnly declared. And he
looked at his knee for a long time. <q>It is difficult to explain,</q> he
said. He wished, evidently, to be very just. <q>It rests on moral grounds,
as Mr. Brand says. It is the question whether it is the best thing for
Gertrude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What is better—what is better, dear uncle?</q> Felix rejoined
urgently, rising in his urgency and standing before Mr. Wentworth. His
uncle had been looking at his knee; but when Felix moved he transferred his
gaze to the handle of the door which faced him. <q>It is usually a fairly
good thing for a girl to marry the man she loves!</q> cried Felix.</p>
            <p>While he spoke, Mr. Wentworth saw the handle of the door begin to turn;
the door opened and remained slightly ajar, until Felix had delivered
himself of the cheerful axiom just quoted. Then it opened altogether and
Gertrude stood there. She looked excited; there was a spark in her sweet,
dull eyes. She came in slowly, but with an air of resolution, and, closing
the door softly, looked round at the three persons present. Felix went to
her with tender gallantry, holding out his hand, and Charlotte made a place
for her on the sofa. But Gertrude put her hands behind her and made no
motion to sit down.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We are talking of you!</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I know it,</q> she answered. <q>That 's why I came.</q> And she
fastened her eyes on her father, who returned her gaze very fixedly. In his
own cold blue eyes there was a kind of pleading, reasoning
light.<pb n="1028"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is better you should be present,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth. <q>We are discussing your future.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why discuss it?</q> asked Gertrude. <q>Leave it to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is, to me!</q> cried Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I leave it, in the last resort, to a greater wisdom than ours,</q>
said the old man.</p>
            <p>Felix rubbed his forehead gently. <q>But en attendant the last resort,
your father lacks confidence,</q> he said to Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Have n't you confidence in Felix?</q> Gertrude was frowning; there
was something about her that her father and Charlotte had never seen.
Charlotte got up and came to her, as if to put her arm round her; but
suddenly, she seemed afraid to touch her.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth, however, was not afraid. <q>I have had more confidence in
Felix than in you,</q> he said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, you have never had confidence in me—never, never! I don't
know why.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh sister, sister!</q> murmured Charlotte.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have always needed advice,</q> Mr. Wentworth declared. <q>You
have had a difficult temperament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why do you call it difficult? It might have been easy, if you had
allowed it. You would n't let me be natural. I don't know what you wanted
to make of me. Mr. Brand was the worst.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charlotte at last took hold of her sister. She laid her two hands upon
Gertrude's arm. <q>He cares so much for you,</q> she almost whispered.</p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at her intently an instant; then kissed her. <q>No, he
does not,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have never seen you so passionate,</q> observed Mr. Wentworth, with
an air of indignation mitigated by high principles.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am sorry if I offend you,</q> said Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You offend me, but I don't think you are sorry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, father, she is sorry,</q> said Charlotte.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I would even go further, dear uncle,</q> Felix interposed. <q>I would
question whether she really offends you. How can she offend you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. Wentworth made no immediate answer. Then, in a moment,
<q>She has not profited as we hoped.</q>
               <pb n="1029"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Profited? Ah voilà!</q> Felix exclaimed.</p>
            <p>Gertrude was very pale; she stood looking down. <q>I have told Felix I
would go away with him,</q> she presently said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, you have said some admirable things!</q> cried the young man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Go away, sister?</q> asked Charlotte.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Away—away; to some strange country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That is to frighten you,</q> said Felix, smiling at Charlotte.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To—what do you call it?</q> asked Gertrude, turning an instant
to Felix. <q>To Bohemia.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do you propose to dispense with preliminaries?</q> asked Mr.
Wentworth, getting up.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Dear uncle, vous plaisantez!</q> cried Felix. <q>It seems to me that
these are preliminaries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude turned to her father. <q>I have profited,</q> she said. <q>You
wanted to form my character. Well, my character is formed—for my age.
I know what I want; I have chosen. I am determined to marry this
gentleman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You had better consent, sir,</q> said Felix very gently.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, sir, you had better consent,</q> added a very different
voice.</p>
            <p>Charlotte gave a little jump, and the others turned to the direction
from which it had come. It was the voice of Mr. Brand, who had stepped
through the long window which stood open to the piazza. He stood patting
his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief; he was very much flushed; his
face wore a singular expression.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, sir, you had better consent,</q> Mr. Brand repeated, coming
forward. <q>I know what Miss Gertrude means.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear friend!</q> murmured Felix, laying his hand caressingly on
the young minister's arm.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand looked at him; then at Mr. Wentworth; lastly at Gertrude. He
did not look at Charlotte. But Charlotte's earnest eyes were fastened to
his own countenance; they were asking an immense question of it. The answer
to this question could not come all at once; but some of the elements of it
were there. It was one of the elements of it that Mr. Brand was very red,
that he held his head very high, that he had a bright, excited eye and an
air of embarrassed boldness—the air of a man who has taken a resolve,
in the execution of <pb n="1030"/>
which he apprehends the failure, not of his moral, but of his
personal, resources. Charlotte thought he looked very grand; and it is
incontestable that Mr. Brand felt very grand. This, in fact, was the
grandest moment of his life; and it was natural that such a moment should
contain opportunities of awkwardness for a large, stout, modest young
man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Come in, sir,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, with an angular wave of his
hand. <q>It is very proper that you should be present.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I know what you are talking about,</q> Mr. Brand rejoined. <q>I heard
what your nephew said.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And he heard what you said!</q> exclaimed Felix, patting him again on
the arm.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am not sure that I understood,</q> said Mr. Wentworth, who had
angularity in his voice as well as in his gestures.</p>
            <p>Gertrude had been looking hard at her former suitor. She had been
puzzled, like her sister; but her imagination moved more quickly than
Charlotte's. <q>Mr. Brand asked you to let Felix take me away,</q> she said
to her father.</p>
            <p>The young minister gave her a strange look. <q>It is not because I don't
want to see you any more,</q> he declared, in a tone intended as it were
for publicity.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I should n't think you would want to see me any more,</q> Gertrude
answered, gently.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth stood staring. <q>Is n't this rather a change, sir?</q> he
inquired.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Yes, sir.</q> And Mr. Brand looked anywhere; only still not at
Charlotte. <q>Yes, sir,</q> he repeated. And he held his handkerchief a few
moments to his lips.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Where are our moral grounds?</q> demanded Mr. Wentworth, who had
always thought Mr. Brand would be just the thing for a younger daughter
with a peculiar temperament.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is sometimes very moral to change, you know,</q> suggested
Felix.</p>
            <p>Charlotte had softly left her sister's side. She had edged gently toward
her father, and now her hand found its way into his arm. Mr. Wentworth had
folded up the <q>Advertiser</q> into a surprisingly small compass, and,
holding the roll with one hand, he earnestly clasped it with the other.<pb n="1031"/>
Mr. Brand was looking at him; and yet, though Charlotte was so
near, his eyes failed to meet her own. Gertrude watched her sister.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is better not to speak of change,</q> said Mr. Brand. <q>In one
sense there is no change. There was something I desired—something I
asked of you; I desire something still—I ask it of you.</q> And he
paused a moment; Mr. Wentworth looked bewildered. <q>I should like, in my
ministerial capacity, to unite this young couple.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude, watching her sister, saw Charlotte flushing intensely, and Mr.
Wentworth felt her pressing upon his arm. <q>Heavenly Powers!</q> murmured
Mr. Wentworth. And it was the nearest approach to profanity he had ever
made.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That is very nice; that is very handsome!</q> Felix exclaimed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't understand,</q> said Mr. Wentworth; though it was plain that
every one else did.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That is very beautiful, Mr. Brand,</q> said Gertrude, emulating
Felix.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I should like to marry you. It will give me great pleasure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As Gertrude says, it 's a beautiful idea,</q> said Felix.</p>
            <p>Felix was smiling, but Mr. Brand was not even trying to. He himself
treated his proposition very seriously. <q>I have thought of it, and I
should like to do it,</q> he affirmed.</p>
            <p>Charlotte, meanwhile, was staring with expanded eyes. Her imagination,
as I have said, was not so rapid as her sister's, but now it had taken
several little jumps. <q>Father,</q> she murmured, <q>consent!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand heard her; he looked away. Mr. Wentworth, evidently, had no
imagination at all. <q>I have always thought,</q> he began, slowly, <q>that
Gertrude's character required a special line of development.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Father,</q> repeated Charlotte, <q>consent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then, at last, Mr. Brand looked at her. Her father felt her leaning more
heavily upon his folded arm than she had ever done before; and this, with a
certain sweet faintness in her voice, made him wonder what was the matter.
He looked down at her and saw the encounter of her gaze with the young
theologian's; but even this told him nothing, and he continued to be
bewildered. Nevertheless, <q>I consent,</q> he said at last, <q>since Mr.
Brand recommends it.</q>
               <pb n="1032"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I should like to perform the ceremony very soon,</q>
observed Mr. Brand, with a sort of solemn simplicity.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Come, come, that 's charming!</q> cried Felix, profanely.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth sank into his chair. <q>Doubtless, when you understand
it,</q> he said, with a certain judicial asperity.</p>
            <p>Gertrude went to her sister and led her away, and Felix having passed
his arm into Mr. Brand's and stepped out of the long window with him, the
old man was left sitting there in unillumined perplexity.</p>
            <p>Felix did no work that day. In the afternoon, with Gertrude, he got into
one of the boats and floated about with idly-dipping oars. They talked a
good deal of Mr. Brand—though not exclusively.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That was a fine stroke,</q> said Felix. <q>It was really
heroic.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude sat musing, with her eyes upon the ripples. <q>That was what he
wanted to be; he wanted to do something fine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He won't be comfortable till he has married us,</q> said Felix. <q>So
much the better.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He wanted to be magnanimous; he wanted to have a fine moral pleasure.
I know him so well,</q> Gertrude went on. Felix looked at her; she spoke
slowly, gazing at the clear water. <q>He thought of it a great deal, night
and day. He thought it would be beautiful. At last he made up his mind that
it was his duty, his duty to do just that—nothing less than that. He
felt exalted; he felt sublime. That 's how he likes to feel. It is better
for him than if I had listened to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It 's better for me,</q> smiled Felix. <q>But do you know, as regards
the sacrifice, that I don't believe he admired you when this decision was
taken quite so much as he had done a fortnight before?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He never admired me. He admires Charlotte; he pitied me. I know him
so well.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, then, he did n't pity you so much.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Gertrude looked at Felix a little, smiling. <q>You should n't permit
yourself,</q> she said, <q>to diminish the splendor of his action. He
admires Charlotte,</q> she repeated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That's capital!</q> said Felix laughingly, and dipping his oars. I
cannot say exactly to which member of Gertrude's phrase he alluded; but he
dipped his oars again, and they kept floating about.<pb n="1033"/>
            </p>
            <p>Neither Felix nor his sister, on that day, was present at
Mr. Wentworth's at the evening repast. The two occupants of the chalet
dined together, and the young man informed his companion that his marriage
was now an assured fact. Eugenia congratulated him, and replied that if he
were as reasonable a husband as he had been, on the whole, a brother, his
wife would have nothing to complain of.</p>
            <p>Felix looked at her a moment, smiling. <q>I hope,</q> he said, <q>not to
be thrown back on my reason.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is very true,</q> Eugenia rejoined, <q>that one's reason is
dismally flat. It 's a bed with the mattress removed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the brother and sister, later in the evening, crossed over to the
larger house, the Baroness desiring to compliment her prospective
sister-in-law. They found the usual circle upon the piazza, with the
exception of Clifford Wentworth and Lizzie Acton; and as every one stood up
as usual to welcome the Baroness, Eugenia had an admiring audience for her
compliment to Gertrude.</p>
            <p>Robert Acton stood on the edge of the piazza, leaning against one of the
white columns, so that he found himself next to Eugenia while she acquitted
herself of a neat little discourse of congratulation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I shall be so glad to know you better,</q> she said; <q>I have seen
so much less of you than I should have liked. Naturally; now I see the
reason why! You will love me a little, won't you? I think I may say I gain
on being known.</q> And terminating these observations with the softest
cadence of her voice, the Baroness imprinted a sort of grand official kiss
upon Gertrude's forehead.</p>
            <p>Increased familiarity had not, to Gertrude's imagination, diminished the
mysterious impressiveness of Eugenia's personality, and she felt flattered
and transported by this little ceremony. Robert Acton also seemed to admire
it, as he admired so many of the gracious manifestations of Madame
Münster's wit.</p>
            <p>They had the privilege of making him restless, and on this occasion he
walked away, suddenly, with his hands in his pockets, and then came back
and leaned against his column. Eugenia was now complimenting her uncle upon
his daughter's engagement, and Mr. Wentworth was listening with his <pb n="1034"/>
usual plain yet refined politeness. It is to be supposed that
by this time his perception of the mutual relations of the young people who
surrounded him had become more acute; but he still took the matter very
seriously, and he was not at all exhilarated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Felix will make her a good husband,</q> said Eugenia. <q>He will be a
charming companion; he has a great quality—indestructible
gayety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You think that 's a great quality?</q> asked the old man.</p>
            <p>Eugenia meditated, with her eyes upon his. <q>You think one gets tired
of it, eh?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know that I am prepared to say that,</q> said Mr.
Wentworth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, we will say, then, that it is tiresome for others but
delightful for one's self. A woman's husband, you know, is supposed to be
her second self; so that, for Felix and Gertrude, gayety will be a common
property.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Gertrude was always very gay,</q> said Mr. Wentworth. He was trying
to follow this argument.</p>
            <p>Robert Acton took his hands out of his pockets and came a little nearer
to the Baroness. <q>You say you gain by being known,</q> he said. <q>One
certainly gains by knowing you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What have you gained?</q> asked Eugenia.</p>
            <p>
               <q>An immense amount of wisdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's a questionable advantage for a man who was already so
wise!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton shook his head. <q>No, I was a great fool before I knew
you!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And being a fool you made my acquaintance? You are very
complimentary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let me keep it up,</q> said Acton, laughing. <q>I hope, for our
pleasure, that your brother's marriage will detain you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Why should I stop for my brother's marriage when I would not stop for
my own?</q> asked the Baroness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why should n't you stop in either case, now that, as you say, you
have dissolved that mechanical tie that bound you to Europe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness looked at him a moment. <q>As I say? You look as if you
doubted it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah,</q> said Acton, returning her glance, <q>that is a remnant<pb n="1035"/>
of my old folly! We have other attractions,</q> he added.
<q>We are to have another marriage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But she seemed not to hear him; she was looking at him still. <q>My word
was never doubted before,</q> she said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We are to have another marriage,</q> Acton repeated, smiling.</p>
            <p>Then she appeared to understand. <q>Another marriage?</q> And she looked
at the others. Felix was chattering to Gertrude; Charlotte, at a distance,
was watching them; and Mr. Brand, in quite another quarter, was turning his
back to them, and, with his hands under his coat-tails and his large head
on one side, was looking at the small, tender crescent of a young moon.
<q>It ought to be Mr. Brand and Charlotte,</q> said Eugenia, <q>but it does
n't look like it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There,</q> Acton answered, <q>you must judge just now by contraries.
There is more than there looks to be. I expect that combination one of
these days; but that is not what I meant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well,</q> said the Baroness, <q>I never guess my own lovers; so I
can't guess other people's.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton gave a loud laugh, and he was about to add a rejoinder when Mr.
Wentworth approached his niece. <q>You will be interested to hear,</q> the
old man said, with a momentary aspiration toward jocosity, <q>of another
matrimonial venture in our little circle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I was just telling the Baroness,</q> Acton observed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. Acton was apparently about to announce his own engagement,</q>
said Eugenia.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wentworth's jocosity increased. <q>It is not exactly that; but it is
in the family. Clifford, hearing this morning that Mr. Brand had expressed
a desire to tie the nuptial knot for his sister, took it into his head to
arrange that, while his hand was in, our good friend should perform a like
ceremony for himself and Lizzie Acton.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baroness threw back her head and smiled at her uncle; then turning,
with an intenser radiance, to Robert Acton, <q>I am certainly very stupid
not to have thought of that,</q> she said. Acton looked down at his boots,
as if he thought he had perhaps reached the limits of legitimate
experimentation, and for a moment Eugenia said nothing more. It had been,
in fact, a sharp knock, and she needed to recover herself. This <pb n="1036"/>
was done, however, promptly enough. <q>Where are the young
people?</q> she asked.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They are spending the evening with my mother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Is not the thing very sudden?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Acton looked up. <q>Extremely sudden. There had been a tacit
understanding; but within a day or two Clifford appears to have received
some mysterious impulse to precipitate the affair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The impulse,</q> said the Baroness, <q>was the charms of your very
pretty sister.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But my sister's charms were an old story; he had always known
her.</q> Acton had begun to experiment again.</p>
            <p>Here, however, it was evident the Baroness would not help him. <q>Ah,
one can't say! Clifford is very young; but he is a nice boy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He 's a likeable sort of boy, and he will be a rich man.</q> This was
Acton's last experiment. Madame Münster turned away.</p>
            <p>She made but a short visit and Felix took her home. In her little
drawing-room she went almost straight to the mirror over the chimney-piece,
and, with a candle uplifted, stood looking into it. <q>I shall not wait for
your marriage,</q> she said to her brother. <q>To-morrow my maid shall pack
up.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My dear sister,</q> Felix exclaimed, <q>we are to be married
immediately! Mr. Brand is too uncomfortable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Eugenia, turning and still holding her candle aloft, only looked
about the little sitting-room at her gimcracks and curtains and cushions.
<q>My maid shall pack up,</q> she repeated. <q>Bonté divine, what
rubbish! I feel like a strolling actress; these are my `properties.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Is the play over, Eugenia?</q> asked Felix.</p>
            <p>She gave him a sharp glance. <q>I have spoken my part.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>With great applause!</q> said her brother.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh, applause—applause!</q> she murmured. And she gathered up
two or three of her dispersed draperies. She glanced at the beautiful
brocade, and then, <q>I don't see how I can have endured it!</q> she
said.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Endure it a little longer. Come to my wedding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thank you; that 's your affair. My affairs are elsewhere.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Where are you going?</q>
               <pb n="1037"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To Germany—by the first ship.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You have decided not to marry Mr. Acton?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have refused him,</q> said Eugenia.</p>
            <p>Her brother looked at her in silence. <q>I am sorry,</q> he rejoined at
last. <q>But I was very discreet, as you asked me to be. I said
nothing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Please continue, then, not to allude to the matter,</q> said
Eugenia.</p>
            <p>Felix inclined himself gravely. <q>You shall be obeyed. But your
position in Germany?</q> he pursued.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Please to make no observations upon it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I was only going to say that I supposed it was altered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are mistaken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But I thought you had signed</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have not signed!</q> said the Baroness.</p>
            <p>Felix urged her no further, and it was arranged that he should
immediately assist her to embark.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brand was indeed, it appeared, very impatient to consummate his
sacrifice and deliver the nuptial benediction which would set it off so
handsomely; but Eugenia's impatience to withdraw from a country in which
she had not found the fortune she had come to seek was even less to be
mistaken. It is true she had not made any very various exertion; but she
appeared to feel justified in generalizing—in deciding that the
conditions of action on this provincial continent were not favorable to
really superior women. The elder world was, after all, their natural field.
The unembarrassed directness with which she proceeded to apply these
intelligent conclusions appeared to the little circle of spectators who
have figured in our narrative but the supreme exhibition of a character to
which the experience of life had imparted an inimitable pliancy. It had a
distinct effect upon Robert Acton, who, for the two days preceding her
departure, was a very restless and irritated mortal. She passed her last
evening at her uncle's, where she had never been more charming; and in
parting with Clifford Wentworth's affianced bride she drew from her own
finger a curious old ring and presented it to her with the prettiest speech
and kiss. Gertrude, who as an affianced bride was also indebted to her
gracious bounty, admired this little incident extremely, and Robert Acton
almost <pb n="1038"/>
wondered whether it did not give him the right, as Lizzie's
brother and guardian, to offer in return a handsome present to the
Baroness. It would have made him extremely happy to be able to offer a
handsome present to the Baroness; but he abstained from this expression of
his sentiments, and they were in consequence, at the very last, by so much
the less comfortable. It was almost at the very last that he saw
her—late the night before she went to Boston to embark.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For myself, I wish you might have stayed,</q> he said. <q>But not for
your own sake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't make so many differences,</q> said the Baroness. <q>I am
simply sorry to be going.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That 's a much deeper difference than mine,</q> Acton declared;
<q>for you mean you are simply glad!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Felix parted with her on the deck of the ship. <q>We shall often meet
over there,</q> he said.  </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't know,</q> she answered. <q>Europe seems to me much larger
than America.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brand, of course, in the days that immediately followed, was not the
only impatient spirit; but it may be said that of all the young spirits
interested in the event none rose more eagerly to the level of the
occasion. Gertrude left her father's house with Felix Young; they were
imperturbably happy and they went far away. Clifford and his young wife
sought their felicity in a narrower circle, and the latter's influence upon
her husband was such as to justify, strikingly, that theory of the
elevating effect of easy intercourse with clever women which Felix had
propounded to Mr. Wentworth. Gertrude was for a good while a distant
figure, but she came back when Charlotte married Mr. Brand. She was present
at the wedding feast, where Felix's gayety confessed to no change. Then she
disappeared, and the echo of a gayety of her own, mingled with that of her
husband, often came back to the home of her earlier years. Mr. Wentworth at
last found himself listening for it; and Robert Acton, after his mother's
death, married a particularly nice young girl.</p>
