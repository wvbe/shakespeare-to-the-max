               <p>If Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am sure
nobody can dispute mine. I own myself of the Company of Beggars; and I
make one at their Weekly Festivals at St. Giles's<ptr target="#n1"/>. I
have a small Yearly Salary for my Catches<ptr target="#n2"/>, and am
welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please, which is more than most
Poets can say.</p>

               <speaker>PLAYER.</speaker>
               <p>As we live by the Muses, it is but a
Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit wherever we find it. The
Muses, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no Distinction to Dress, and
never partially mistake the Pertness of Embroidery for Wit, nor the
Modesty of Want for Dulness. Be the Author who he will, we push his
Play as far as it will go. So (though you are in Want) I wish you
success heartily.  </p>

               <speaker>BEGGAR.</speaker>
               <p>This piece I own
was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of James Chanter
and Moll Lay, two most excellent Ballad-Singers.  I have introduced
the Similes that are in all your celebrated Operas; The Swallow, the
Moth, the Bee, the Ship, the Flower, &amp;c. Besides, I have a
Prison-Scene, which the Ladies always reckon charmingly pathetick. As
to the Parts, I have observed such a nice Impartiality to our two
Ladies that it is impossible for either of them to take Offence. I
hope I may be forgiven, that I have not made my Opera throughout
unnatural, like those in vogue; for I have no Recitative<ptr target="#n3"/>; excepting this, as I have consented to have neither
Prologue nor Epilogue, it must be allowed an Opera in all its Forms.
The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently represented by
ourselves in our Great Room at St. Giles's, so that I cannot too often
acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage.  </p>

withdraw; the Actors are preparing to begin. Play away the Overture.</p>

                  <p>A Lawyer is an honest Employment, so is mine. Like me too he acts in a 
double Capacity, both against Rogues and for 'em; for 'tis but fitting that

                  <p>If none of the Gang take her off, she
may, in the common course of Business, live a Twelve-month longer. I
love to let Women scape. A good Sportsman always lets the Hen
Partridges fly, because the Breed of the Game depends upon them.
Besides, here the Law allows us no Reward; there is nothing to be got
by the Death of Women—except our Wives.  </p>

of the Gang, <stage type="act">Reading</stage> Crook-finger'd Jack. A
Year and a half in the service; Let me see how much the Stock owes to
his Industry; one, two, three, four, five Gold Watches, and seven
Silver ones.  A mighty clean-handed Fellow! Sixteen Snuff-boxes, five
of them of true Gold. Six Dozen of Handkerchiefs, four silver-hilted
Swords, half Dozen of Shirts, three Tye-Periwigs<ptr target="#n11"/>, and
a piece of Broad-Cloth. Considering these are only the Fruits of his
leisure Hours, I don't know a prettier Fellow, for no Man alive hath a
more engaging Presence of Mind upon the Road. Wat Dreary, alias Brown
Will, an irregular Dog, who hath an underhand way of disposing of his
Goods. I'll try him only for a Sessions or two longer upon his
Good-behaviour. Harry Padington, a poor petty-larceny Rascal, without
the least Genius; that Fellow, though he were to live these six
Months, will never come to the Gallows with any Credit. Slippery Sam;
he goes off the next Sessions, for the Villain hath the Impudence to
have Views of Following his Trade as a Tailor, which he calls an
honest Employment. Mat of the Mint; listed not above a Month ago, a
promising sturdy Fellow, and diligent in his way; somewhat too bold
and hasty, and may raise good Contributions on the Public, if he does
not cut himself short by Murder. Tom Tipple, a guzzling soaking Sot,
who is always too drunk to stand himself, or to make others stand. A
Cart<ptr target="#n12"/> is absolutely necessary for him. Robin of
Bagshot<ptr target="#n13"/>, alias Gorgon, alias Bob Bluff, alias
Carbuncle, alias Bob Booty.  </p>

are bitter bad Judges in these cases, for they are so partial to the

                  <p>Murder is as fashionable a Crime as a Man
can be guilty of. How many fine Gentlemen have we in Newgate every
Year, purely upon that Article! If they have wherewithal to persuade
the Jury to bring it in Manslaughter, what are they the worse for it?
So, my Dear, have done upon this Subject. Was Captain Macheath here
this Morning for the Bank-Notes<ptr target="#n17"/> he left with you last
Week?  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>MRS. PEACHUM.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my Dear; and though the Bank
hath stopt Payment, he was so cheerful and so agreeable! Sure there is
not a finer Gentleman upon the Road than the Captain! If he comes from
Bagshot<ptr target="#n18"/> at any reasonable Hour, he hath promis'd to
make one this Evening with Polly and me, and Bob Booty at a party of
Quadrille <ptr target="#n19"/>. Pray, my dear, is the Captain rich?  </p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>PEACHUM.</speaker>
                  <p>The Captain keeps too good Company ever
to grow rich.  Mary-bone<ptr target="#n20"/> and the Chocolate-houses<ptr target="#n21"/> are his undoing. The Man that proposes to get Money by
Play should have the Education of a fine Gentleman, and be train'd up
to it from his Youth.  </p>

grant every Liberty but one. You see I would not indulge the Girl as
far as prudently we can. In anything, but Marriage! After that, my
Dear, how shall we be safe? Are we not then in her Husband's Power?
For a Husband hath the absolute Power over all a Wife's Secrets but
her own. If the Girl had the Discretion of a Court-Lady, who can have
a Dozen young Fellows at her Ear without complying with one, I should
not matter it; but Polly is Tinder, and a Spark will at once set her
on a Flame. Married! If the Wench does not know her own Profit, sure
she knows her own Pleasure better than to make herself a Property! My
Daughter to me should be, like a Court-Lady to a Minister of State, a
Key to the whole Gang. Married! If the Affair is not already done,
I'll terrify her from it, by the Example of our Neighbours.  </p>

Heart to take off a great Man. When I consider his Personal Bravery,
his fine Strategem<ptr target="#n42"/>, how much we have already got by
him, and how much more we may get, methinks I can't find it in my

What then will become of Polly!——As yet I may inform him
of their Design, and aid him in hisEscape.——It shall be
so——But then he flies, absents himself, and I bar myself
from his dear Conversation! That too will distract me.——If

intend that Macheath shall be really executed.  </p>

                  <p>Most certainly, Sir.——To make
the Piece perfect, I was for doing strict poetical
Justice——Macheath is to be hang'd; and for the other
Personages of the Drama, the Audience must have suppos'd they were all
hang'd or transported.  </p>

                  <speaker>PLAYER.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then Friend, this is a downright deep
Tragedy. The Catastrophe is manifestly wrong, for an Opera must end
happily.  </p>

                  <speaker>BEGGAR.</speaker>
                  <p>Your Objection, Sir, is very just, and is
easily remov'd. For you must allow, that in this kind of Drama, 'tis
no matter how absurdly things are brought
about——So——you Rabble there——run
and cry, A Reprieve!<ptr target="#n107"/> ——let the Prisoner
be brought back to his Wives in Triumph.  </p>

                  <p>Through the whole Piece you may observe
such a Similitude of Manners in high and low Life, that it is
difficult to determine whether (in the fashionable Vices) the fine
Gentlemen imitate the Gentlemen of the Road, or the Gentlemen of the
Road, the fine Gentlemen.——Had the Play remain'd, as I at
first intended, it would have carried a most excellent Moral.  'Twould
have shown that the lower sort of People have their Vices in a degree
as well as the Rich: And that they are punish'd for them.  <stage type="desc">To them, MACHEATH with RABBLE, &amp;c.</stage>

            <note xml:id="n2" type="ed">Catches: songs. The term here refers to poems, especially
those which might be turned into ballads sung to popular tunes.
Technically, a catch is a kind of round for three voices.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n3" type="ed">Recitative: a stylized spoken passage in an opera or
oratorio. There is a recitative in The Beggar's Opera, but it is a
mock-recitative, so the Beggar's assertion is honest so far as it
goes. </note>
            <note xml:id="n4" type="ed">plead her Belly: By law a pregnant woman could not be
executed.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n5" type="ed">Book him: arrange for “transportation” as an
alternative to hanging. </note>
            <note xml:id="n6" type="ed">Transportation: placed on a ship bound for the West
Indies or the colonies in North America (later also Australia) for
“service,” generally to a plantation owner for a set term of
years.</note>
            <note xml:id="n7" type="ed">Lock: warehouse for stolen goods. Peachum's principal
trade is in “fencing” (selling stolen goods) through merchants
such as Mrs. Trapes.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n8" type="ed">Education: as a pickpocket. Thieves were trained by an
apprenticeship system that resembled that in use in legitimate trades.</note>
            <note xml:id="n9" type="ed">Newgate: the principal jail of London. There were some
150 jails in the city.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n10" type="ed">Sessions: English justices of peace sat for a specified
term to hear cases. If a case did not come before the justices, the
prisoner was held over until the next sessions. Peachum, who is based
on the notorious Jonathan Wild, is using the court system to clean out
the less efficient members of his gang by the expedient of handing
them over for a reward, to be hanged. Wild had a gang of some 1500
thieves, and was the undisputed master of the London underworld in the
early 1720's.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n11" type="ed">Periwig: the powdered wig worn by Gentlemen. Macheath,
Peachum, and Lockit would also wear these; while not Gentlemen, their
high position in the underworld would procure them the marks of a
higher class, the better to gain access to courtiers and bureaucrats
who found these men useful.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n12" type="ed">Cart: criminals went to their executions in an open cart
so that the populace could see them.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n13" type="ed">Robin...Booty: these are names for Sir Robert Walpole,
prime minister, whose corrupt administration is the target of much of
the serious satire in The Beggar's Opera.  Because of this, the even
more pointed sequel, Polly Peachum, was denied performance on the
stage, though it was published and sold well.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n14" type="ed">Camp: military service, particularly as an officer.</note>
            <note xml:id="n15" type="ed">Venus's Girdle...smugly: a young woman who becomes a
votary of Venus will soon take on the complexion of some of Venus'
flowers, and show signs of self-satisfaction.  </note>

love.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n17" type="ed">Bank-Notes: the equivalent of cashier's checks. Required

with fashionable gentlemen.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n21" type="ed">Chocolate-Houses: a high-fashion drink, chocolate, which
was something like the hot cocoa of today, was served in a kind of
tavern supposedly specializing in the drink. However, much stronger
drink was available, and high-stakes gambling was rife in these
establishments, as at Marybone.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n22" type="ed">Temple: section of London containing the Inns of Court,
where young lawyers received their training. A good location for a
“coffee-house” which, like the chocolate-houses, offered a
variety of beverages.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n23" type="ed">Cambric: fine linen. The handkerchiefs of the gentry
were often embroidered with their identifying symbols and initials.</note>
            <note xml:id="n24" type="ed">Chap: short for “chapman,” a purchaser.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n25" type="ed">Guineas: gold coin worth 21 shillings.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n26" type="ed">Redriff: suburb of the Port of London, where many
sailors lived.  </note>

watch-pocket.  </note>

pump; a common punishment for juvenile offenders.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n29" type="ed">Hockley-in-the-Hole: a popular resort of thugs and
prostitutes.  Bear-baiting and cock-fights took place there.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n30" type="ed">Old Baily: criminal court, since generally spelled Old
Bailey.  Jonathan Wild kept an office near the court, to facilitate
his business in turning in thieves and collecting rewards for the
return of stolen goods.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n31" type="ed">Ordinary's Papers: the prison chaplain's record of
confessions. Mrs.  Peachum can imagine no other end to Filch's career
than Newgate prison.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n32" type="ed">Covent-Garden: large flower market in London. Some of
the “flowers” were prostitutes.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n33" type="ed">Repeating-Watch: an especially expensive type of watch
that chimed the hour.  </note>

            <note xml:id="n35" type="ed">Tunbridge: a town to the north of London.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n36" type="ed">Fullers-Earth: a “soap,” very abrasive and
effective, made from the microscopic skeletons of diatoms, a kind of
plankton.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n37" type="ed">Plate: tableware, sometimes silver but most often of
pewter. A very common object of theft, as it was easily melted down if
too recognizable.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n38" type="ed">...is but picking: mere picking of pockets or
shop-lifting.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n39" type="ed">Jointure: a transfer of funds or property from husband

could be impeached on the testimony of one witness, but convicted only
on that of two or more.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n41" type="ed">Play-Books: an in-joke, as many of the patrons present
will have bought a copy of the “Opera,” or if they have not,
are thus wryly encouraged to do so. Many plays were romances and the
books were regarded by parents as a “bad influence.” </note>
            <note xml:id="n42" type="ed">Strategem: strategy; here the Captain's skill in
conducting robberies upon the Road.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n43" type="ed">Holborn: the slums between Newgate and Tyburn (the place
of execution).  </note>
            <note xml:id="n44" type="ed">Jack Ketch: a generic nick-name for hangmen. The
original Jack Ketch plied his trade in the previous century.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n45" type="ed">Miss Fire: flintlock pistols depended upon a spark from
the flint to strike the powder in the “pan,” which then
ignited the compressed powder in the barrel through a small “touch
hole.” The spark often went in some other direction than the pan,
so that the pistol failed to shoot. This was very aptly called a miss
Fire, and the term has survived as “misfire.” </note>
            <note xml:id="n46" type="ed">Slip her Shoulder: a highwayman's horse was expected to
carry him away safely at night upon uneven ground. If it stepped in a

Jonathan Wild had operated a brothel there.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n57" type="ed">Strong-Waters: Geneva, a strong distilled drink, which

percentage rates—like modern credit card companies).  </note>

            <note xml:id="n62" type="ed">Keeping: a mistress, or “kept woman,” was said
to be “in Keeping.” It was important for mistresses to dress
well; their function was as much for escort as for sexual services.</note>
            <note xml:id="n63" type="ed">Bating: excepting. It was traditional, when saying
anything complimentary of Jews, to append a disclaimer as to their
illegal faith.  </note>

the keys of the prison and opened and closed doors for prisoners,
jailors, ordinaries, visitors, laundry-women, and all others who had
business in the prison.  In most cases, though not always, they also
brought food, bedding, and the like to the cells and wards.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n69" type="ed">Garnish: Lockit has obtained his position by submitting
the high bid for a Government contract. The return on his investment
is obtained by extracting fees from his prisoners for “liquor,
food, walking space, lighter chains, and bedding. A final outrageous
feature of this system forced prisoners acquitted of crimes to pay a
discharge fee” (Guerinot &amp; Jilg 38).  </note>

his contract to run the concession of Newgate, some fees, such as the
rewards for criminals caught and executed, were owed by the government
to him (and his partner). The state bureaucracy was notoriously slow
in payment.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n76" type="ed">Condemn'd Hold: the Stone Hold. A prisoner entering
Newgate who could not pay his fees was kept here.  There was neither

            <note xml:id="n78" type="ed">...expect the Gentleman: Jonathan Wild actually
advertised in the papers his business in locating and returning stolen

“bubble”: the “South Seas Bubble” was a famous

bloodhounds.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n83" type="ed">Herds, Droves, or Flocks: Gay is mistaken here; these
are all social animals. That information would not have been available
to him at the time; most of what was known in England of lions, for
example, was true of the Asian lion of the Near East, which was more
solitary in its habits than the now much more common African lion.</note>

pregnant, for she could not be hanged until the child was born and
provided for, by which time another Sessions might have passed.</note>
            <note xml:id="n88" type="ed">Great Man: Macheath. This was also a common (sarcastic)
expression for referring to Sir Robert Walpole.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n89" type="ed">Setting: euphemism for watching a traveler for a
convenient opportunity to rob him. The term actually means to spy on a
criminal for an opportunity to safely arrest him. Jenny Diver and
Sukey Tawdrey, in effecting Macheath's capture earlier, act as
“setters” in the usual sense. The Irish Setter got its name
from this practice, for it “points” game much as a criminal is
“finger'd” or “peach'd”.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n90" type="ed">Rouleau: coins, particularly of gold, that have been
sorted, counted, vand rolled.  </note>
            <note xml:id="n91" type="ed">Coronation Account: list of items stolen from the large
numbers who had attended festivities celebrating a coronation

            <p>Baptized at Barnstaple, Devon, on September 16, 1685, during the reign 
of Charles II, John Gay was orphaned by the age of ten but raised by a 
kind uncle, who saw to his education at the local grammar school. On 
reaching adulthood, Gay was apprenticed to a mercer, but he disliked this 
occupation and found a post, in or near 1712, as secretary to the Duchess 
of Monmouth. In 1714, with the sponsorship of Jonathan Swift, Gay joined 
the household of Lord Clarendon, and journeyed with him to the Continent. 
Gay's friendly and ingratiating character won him many friends, not a few 
of whom were courtiers who found employment for him, either in their own 
households, or with the Government, throughout his life. Immediately 
after losing a small fortune in the South Sea Bubble, Gay was appointed 
Lottery Commissioner (!!), a post he held nearly to the end of his life. 
Gay never married, and divided his time among his friends, especially the 
Duke and Duchess of Queensberry and the members of the Scriblerians, 
including Swift and Pope.                    
</p>
            <p>John Gay produced, apart from <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi>, a small body of 
prose and poetry ranging in quality from brilliant to drab. In 1712 was 
printed, but never acted, a short topical play, <hi rend="italic">The Mohocks</hi>, concerning 
the exploits of a gang who had named themselves after a warlike Native 
American tribe:

            </p>
            <p>The point of this slight work, if it has one, seems to be that frolicsome 
gentlemen, by introducing chaos into society, have only themselves to 
blame if that chaos leads to their own downfall. The moral concern that 
drives <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi> is found here, along with its sense of play 
and eye for detail; it is easy to see why the Scriblerians adopted Gay so 
wholeheartedly so early in his career.  
</p>
            <p>In 1714, his <hi rend="italic">The Shepherd's Week</hi> appeared, demonstrating a sustained 
competence in producing couplets which, in the pastoral tradition, 
oscillate gently between mockery and a sweet seriousness: 
<quote>
                  <l>              Ah woful Day! ah woful Noon and Morn!</l>
                  <l>           When first by thee my Younglings white were shorn,</l>
                  <l>           Then first, I ween, I cast a Lover's Eye,</l>
                  <l>           My Sheep were Silly, but more Silly I.</l>
                  <l>           Beneath the Shears they felt no lasting Smart,</l>
                  <l>           They lost but Fleeces while I lost a Heart.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The What-d'ye Call it</hi>, a Tragi-Comi-Pastoral-Farce, was briefly 
staged in 1715. It has relatively little merit, or interest other than 
that Alexander Pope and John Arbuthnot seem to have assisted in the 
writing of it. Gay's concern here, as it would be in <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's 
Opera</hi>, is the suffering imposed upon the poor by the rich in a corrupt 
society.
</p>
            <p>A year later, in humorous tribute to his adopted London, Gay produced 
<hi rend="italic">Trivia: or, the Art of Walking the Streets of London</hi>. The 
inconveniences of life amid eighteenth-century urban hurly-burly are 
sharply chronicled:
<quote>
                  <l>           Pent round with Perils, in the Midst you stand,</l>
                  <l>           And call for Aid in vain; the Coachman swears,</l>
                  <l>           And Car-Men drive, unmindful of thy Prayers.</l>
                  <l>           Where wilt thou turn? ah! whither wilt thou fly?</l>
                  <l>           On ev'ry Side the pressing Spokes are nigh.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>In 1724, a rather stilted, if well plotted, tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The Captives</hi>, 
was staged at Drury-Lane. In 1727, Gay brought out a collection of 
original verse <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> on the model of Aesop. They are good reading, 
despite their subsequent neglect, but they are overshadowed by the 
crystalline clarity and fine-honed irony of <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi>. </p>
            <p>Gay, with the encouragement of Swift and Pope, tried to interest Colley 
Cibber, the manager of the theatre at Drury-Lane, in putting on his new 
ballad farce, but encountered disdain. It is possible that the 
experienced Cibber liked the work, but mistrusted its considerable 
departure from accepted theatrical conventions and potentially dangerous 
political satire. The Duchess of Queensberry used her influence (and 
money: she promised to cover costs in the event of a loss) to convince 
another reluctant manager, John Rich of the Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, to take 
on the piece. Rich had had a mild success recently with a revival of <hi rend="italic">The 
Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, but had since found very little useful material 
to bring in the crowds, and was staging a number of unmemorable 
pantomimes, even playing the part of Harlequin himself (Schultz 11).</p>
            <p>James Quin, the company's leading actor, was to have been Macheath, but 
felt himself a poor singer and uncomfortable with the role, and 
recommended the more obscure Thomas Walker, who was found backstage 
humming one of the songs in a lively fashion, and was hired on the spot 
(Schultz 36-37). Walker was not, in fact, a great singer, but he brought 
to the role a romantic and aristocratic verve that was a perfect foil for 
the sweet and idealistic Polly. Miss Lavinia Fenton, a player with the 
company, who had been earning fifteen shillings a week, was found to be a 
very able singer for the part of Polly, and was engaged for the part at 
thirty shillings a week Schultz 23). 
</p>
            <p>The first performance, on January 29, began, it is said, with some 
concern on the part of the audience, for the departure from the 
conventions of the day was considerable. But the sparkling dialogue, witty 
satire, and ingenious ballads set to well-loved familiar tunes carried 
their own weight, and we have a report from Pope, as remembered by Joseph 
Spence: 
<quote>
                  <l>  We were all at the first night of it, in great uncertainty of the </l>
                  <l>  event; till we were very much encouraged by overhearing the Duke </l>
                  <l>  of Argyle, who sat in the box next to us, say, “it will do,—it </l>
                  <l>  must do!—I see it in the eyes of them.”—This was a good while </l>
                  <l>  before the first act was over, and so gave us ease soon; for the </l>
                  <l>  duke, (besides his own good taste) has a more particular knack </l>
                  <l>  than anyone now living, in discovering the taste of the public. He </l>
                  <l>  was quite right in this, as usual; the good nature of the audience </l>
                  <l>  appeared stronger and stronger with every act, and ended in a </l>
                  <l>  clamour of applause (<hi rend="italic">Anecdotes</hi> 159; in Schultz, 3).</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The success proved overwhelming. The London weekly <hi rend="italic">The Craftsman</hi>, on 
February 3, carried a short notice: 
<quote>
                  <l>  This Week a Dramatick Entertainment has been exhibited at the </l>
                  <l>  Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, entitled the Beggar's Opera, </l>
                  <l>  which has met with a very general Applause, insomuch that the </l>
                  <l>  Waggs say it hath made Rich very Gay, and probably will make Gay </l>
                  <l>  very Rich.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Gay cleared over six hundred pounds, in fact, while Rich was enabled to 
begin construction on a fine new theatre in Covent-Garden. That year the 
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields performances ran to sixty-two, all to full houses, an 
unprecedented achievement. The play was staged in a number of other 
cities in England while the original London run was still in progress, 
and spread to Wales and Ireland, and was the first musical comedy 
produced in New York City. <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi> was printed (and pirated) 
in many editions; the songs were sung everywhere, and prints of Miss 
Fenton as Polly were sold in all the shops. The actress was mobbed 
wherever she went, and eventually married a lord, the Duke of Bolton, who 
had been present on opening night and lost his heart upon first hearing 
her sing “Oh ponder well! Be not severe.” 
</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi> is a comic farce, poking accurate fun at the 
prevailing fashion in Italian opera as well as the social and political 
climate of the age. It established a new genre, the “ballad opera,” of 
which it remains the only really notable example, though its popularity 
led to the work Sheridan and eventually Gilbert and Sullivan. Gay cuts 
the standard five acts to three, and tightly controls the dialogue and 
plot so that there are delightful surprises in each of the forty-five 
fast-paced scenes.
</p>
            <p>Peachum, who is both fence and thief-catcher (see note 10, below), sets 
the tone with his song of self-justification as he sits at his account-book: 
<quote>
                  <l>            Through all the Employments of Life</l>
                  <l>              Each Neighbour abuses his Brother;</l>

                  <l>            And the Statesman, because he's so great,</l>

               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Peachum comes in, and overhearing her husband's blacklisting of 
unproductive thieves, remonstrates with him over one of them, but easily 
goes along:
<quote>
                  <l> You know, my Dear, I never meddle in matters of Death; I always leave </l>
                  <l> those Affairs to you. Women are indeed bad Judges in these cases, for </l>
                  <l> they are so partial to the Brave that they think every Man handsome </l>
                  <l> who is going to the Camp or the Gallows. </l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The middle-class criminal complacency of these two is shattered by their 
discovery that their daughter Polly has secretly married Macheath, the 
famous highwayman. Peachum's famous objection:
<quote>
                  <l> Do you think your Mother and I should have liv'd comfortably so long </l>
                  <l> together if ever we had been married?</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>is seconded by Mrs. Peachum's:
<quote>
                  <l> Can you support the Expence of a Husband, Hussy, in Gaming, Drinking </l>
                  <l> and Whoring? Have you Money enough to carry on the daily Quarrels of </l>
                  <l> Man and Wife about who shall squander most? There are not many </l>
                  <l> Husbands and Wives, who can bear the Charges of plaguing one another </l>
                  <l> in a handsome way. </l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The parents conclude, however, that the match may make sense, provided 
the husband can be killed for his money. They depart, intent on this 
errand, and we find that Polly has hidden her man on the premises. She 
informs him of his danger, and there follows a touching duet, in spite of 
its intentional burlesque of popular love scenes:
<quote>
                  <l>           MACHEATH. And I would love you all the Day,</l>
                  <l>           POLLY.    Every Night would kiss and play,</l>
                  <l>           MACHEATH. If with me you'd fondly stray</l>
                  <l>           POLLY.    Over the Hills and far away.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Macheath's idea of escaping is to repair to a tavern and gather around 
him a company of women of dubious virtue. These, though they are of the 
lowest possible class of society, vie with one another in displaying 
perfect drawing-room manners, although the subject of their conversation 
is their success in picking pockets and shoplifting. Two of them, to 
Macheath's great surprise, have contracted with Peachum to capture him, 
and Macheath finds himself a prisoner in Newgate, the great City prison. 
Here, it develops, the jailor's daughter, Lucy Lockit, awaits her chance 
to upbraid Macheath for having promised to marry her, and reneged. 
<quote>
                  <l> You base Man you,——how can you look me in the Face after what hath </l>
                  <l> passed between us?——See here, perfidious Wretch, how I am forc'd to </l>
                  <l> bear about the Load of Infamy you have laid upon me——O Macheath! </l>
                  <l> thou hast robb'd me of my Quiet——to see thee tortur'd would give me </l>
                  <l> Pleasure. </l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Macheath succeeds in mollifying her, only to have Polly drop in at this 
inopportune moment, nearly ruining his chances of escape by claiming him 
for her husband in Lucy's presence. Macheath finds himself forced to 
pretend that Polly is crazy, and succeeds in forcing her to retreat—but 
something in the performance fills Lucy with foreboding: “But that Polly 
runs in my Head strangely.” And she sings, affectingly:
<quote>
                  <l>                 If love be not his Guide,</l>
                  <l>                   He never will come back!</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>There would be, as the Beggar promised, difficulty choosing between the 
two young women, but for Lucy's capacity for violence and revenge. 
Macheath notices, and this would be fatal to her cause, were it not lost 
already: 
<quote>
                  <l> LUCY. How happy I am, if you say this from your heart! For I love </l>
                  <l> thee so, that I could sooner bear to see thee hang'd than in the Arms </l>
                  <l> of another. </l>
                  <l> MACHEATH. But could'st thou bear to see me hang'd? </l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>In spite of her fears, Lucy aids Macheath in his escape. Her father 
learns of Macheath's promise of marriage to her, and determines to learn 
from Peachum the status of Polly's possible marriage, for if Macheath is 
recaptured and hanged, his fortune will be subject to rival claims. Lockit 
visits Peachum, and they discover, while listening to a long-winded 
account by Mrs. Trapes, the whereabouts of Macheath. They conclude to go 
halves in him, and the chase is on. Mrs. Trapes shows the practical 
presence of mind that characterizes these underworld characters, by not 
presuming upon Peachum and Lockit's promise of a reward: 
<quote>
                  <l>   TRAPES. I don't enquire after your Affairs——so whatever happens, </l>
                  <l> I wash my hands on't——It hath always been my Maxim, that one Friend </l>
                  <l> should assist another——But if you please——I'll take one of the </l>
                  <l> Scarfs home with me. 'Tis always good to have something in Hand. </l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Polly, meanwhile, goes to visit Lucy in hopes of working something out, 
little knowing that Lucy has resolved to poison her. In a fine takeoff on 
melodramatic murder scenes, Polly narrowly avoids the cup, and Macheath's 
recapture is revealed. In the scene memorialized by Hogarth, who was 
present on opening night, The two “wives” plead with their fathers, 
unavailingly, for Macheath's life. Then, in a moment of inspired 
burlesque, Macheath finds that his life has become too complex for him:
<quote>
                  <l>   JAILOR. Four Women more, Captain, with a Child apiece! See, here </l>
                  <l> they come. </l>
                  <l>   MACHEATH. What——four Wives more!——This is too much——Here——</l>
                  <l> tell the Sheriff's Officers I am ready. </l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>A scene, reminiscent of the interruptions in <hi rend="italic">The Rehearsal</hi>, interposes, 
in which the Beggar explains that he would have provided a properly moral 
ending with the hanging of Macheath, “and for the other Personages of the 
Drama, the Audience is to suppose they were all either hang'd or 
transported.” But the “taste of the town” will not allow this, for the 
people had not come to see a tragedy, and must have a happy ending. 
Macheath is brought back, to the general cry of “a Reprieve,” and invites 
all to a dance of celebration, declaring to Polly that he acknowledges 
his marriage to her as binding.
</p>
            <p>The intent of the play is clearly to remind those in high place that 
corruption at their level leads to corruption and suffering throughout 
society. As such, it is a highly moral play, in spite of its apparent 
glamorization of the criminal life. Two weeks after opening night, an 
article appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Craftsman</hi>, the leading Opposition newspaper, 
ostensibly protesting Gay's work as libelous, but actually assisting him 
in satirizing the Walpole establishment by very clumsily taking the 
government's side:

                  <l> Satire is general; and that it discovers a Consciousness of Guilt for </l>

                  <l> that there are such things as Innuendo's (a never-failing Method of </l>

               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The commentator drives home his point by taking note of the Beggar's last 
remark, which is the most important of the play: “That the lower People 
have their Vices in a Degree as well as the Rich, and are punished for 
them,——innuendo, that rich People never are” (89). The article was 
reprinted as <hi rend="italic">A Key To The Beggar's Opera</hi>, and widely distributed.
</p>
            <p>Following the success of the Opera, Gay wrote a sequel in which Polly 
follows her husband to the West Indies, which though never performed (it 
was banned by the Lord Chamberlain, presumably for the sharp satire it 
contained), sold very well in the bookshops. <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi> is confusingly 
plotted and attempts too many things at once, though its songs are not 
unmemorable:
<quote>
                  <l>                 Tho' peevish and old</l>
                  <l>                 If Women have Gold,</l>
                  <l>               They have Youth, Good-Humour and Beauty:</l>
                  <l>                 Among all Mankind</l>
                  <l>                 Without it we find</l>
                  <l>               Nor Love, nor Favour nor Duty.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Gay also wrote, as he was nearing his end, a serious opera, <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi>, 
which was performed briefly at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and 
allowed quietly to disappear into deserved obscurity. 
</p>
            <p>To the end, although Gay was financially improvident, his loyal 
friends, particularly the Duchess of Queensberry, watched over him. He 
died in London in 1732, at forty-seven years of age. His remains were 
interred in the Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey, and marked with an 
inscription which included these lines: 
<quote>
                  <l>              Life is a Jest, and all Things show it:</l>
                  <l>              I thought so once, and now I know it.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Gay was a serious artist, never more so than when producing satire; but 
it is fitting for the persona of the Beggar to pronounce his last rites.
