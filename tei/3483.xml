After the offering to Diana, a dance of female Trojans takes place, which is interrupted by the arrival of a meſſenger from Caſſandra, who wiſhes to come from her place of confinement <hi>(detained there as a lunatic)</hi> to expound a prophecy. Paris, after ſome deliberation, complies with the requeſt: the meſſenger retires, and, ſoon after, returns with Caſſandra, who deplores her ſituation, in conſequence of being treated as one deranged in mind: ſhe informs Paris of the approaching danger of Troy. Paris, the Prieſts, Prieſteſſes, &amp;c. ſhew every mark of diſbelief, which enrages, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra, who, ſeizing her wand from her attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, invokes the Gods: informs Paris that ſhe has the power to perform a miracle, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines that inſtant to put it to the teſt, then leave him to judge of the truth of her prophecy. Caſſandra ſtrikes the figures of the Gods, which change from gold to black marble.</p>
               <p>Paris and the reſt are ſeized with horror! The actions diſplayed by the various groups, expreſſive of fear, hope, and revenge, forms the moſt lively and intereſting picture of the various paſſions that agitate the human breaſt, which it is poſſible to convey through the medium of ſcenic effect.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0214001400:13"/>and while the unſuſpecting Trojans are buried in wine and ſleep, Ulyſſes and his party ſeize the gates of the city, let in the covering army, who enter with ſhouts, that ſeem to rend the ſkies; breaking open houſes, putting all to the ſword, without ſparing age or ſex; the confuſion becomes general; palaces and other magnificent buildings fall a ſacrifice to the fury of the flames.</p>
               <p>Helen is diſcovered in a tower, ſurrounded with fire, and no mode of eſcaping inevitable death.</p>
               <p>The dreadful claſhing of ſwords and ſhields, together with the conqueſt and deſtruction of Troy, terminate this grand ſpectacle; of which diſmal cataſtrophe, the poet gives the following emphatical deſcription:—

            <head>REMARKS.</head>
            <p>PERHAPS no ſubject ever afforded a greater ſcope for the painter's pencil, or the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the machiniſt, in point of ſtage-effect, than the Famous SIEGE of TROY; nor has the compoſer had a leſs field for his muſical abilities. It will be ſeen, that the performers in general have each their ſhare of buſineſs in this ſplendid and heroic ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, and are not wanting in pantomimic action, to convey a proper idea of the nature of the ſiege, as well as the credulity of the beſieged, in admitting within their walls the grand Trojan War Horſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained five hundred Grecian ſoldiers, properly equipped for battle, &amp;c. within its body.</p>
            <p>☞ The pantomime will be given every evening till further notice.</p>
