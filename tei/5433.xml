as followeth:</p>
            <p>FIrſt came the Bellman and Sexton of the
Town, with Staves in their Hands.</p>
            <p>Then Two Purſivants, bearing Pendants, with

Then a Herald, carrying his Coat-Armour,
being a Field Sable, charged with Three Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
Caps, each with a Golden Band.</p>
            <p>Then followed Two Old Women, one having
a Bundle of Addreſſes on her Back, and a Paper
on her Breaſt, with this Inſcription, <hi>We defie all
Anti-Monarchial, Anti-Epiſcopal, and</hi> [almoſt all]
<hi>Atheiſtical and Popiſh Principles</hi>; the other was
covered all over with Pamphlets of divers ſorts;

            <p>Here followed a young Damſel, <hi>who had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

            </p>
            <p>Then 6 Men with Red Hats, having Beads in
their Hands, with this Inſcription on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
<hi>Nunc aut Nunquam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then an Old Man, with a long Beard, clothed
in pure white Raiment; having the D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1100800900:5"/>
Then a Woman, preciouſly deck'd, ſitting (<hi>as
near as I could gueſs</hi>) upon a Scarlet-colour'd
Beaſt, having abundance of Names, written in
Capital Letters, <hi>MYSTERY,</hi> &amp;c</p>
            <p>Then came the High-Ch<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">

               </gap>ch IDOL [<hi>in
Garments as black as his Deeds</hi>] on a Sorrel Horſe.</p>
            <p>After him 24 Tinkers, beating on their Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
that the Spectators might know what La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
they were in.</p>
            <p>Then a vaſt Mob, hollowing, hooping and
playing the Devil.</p>
            <p>In this Order he was conducted to his Inn,
where he was again Congratulated, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Wine. In fine, the Evening concluded
with Ringing of Bells, Bonfires, Drunkenneſs,
and all manner of Lewdneſs.</p>
            <p>The Champion left this Town next Morning,
and ſet out for <hi>W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>__…</desc>
                  </gap>ck,</hi> where he was again
met, and Congratulated by the Monkeys in
their Formalities. They entreated him to tarry
ſome time with them; but he declined it, and
purſued his Journey to the next Corporation;
for, you muſt know, he expects the ſame Honours
to be paid him where-ever he goes; which (how
ſtrange ſoever it may ſeem to ſome) is no new
thing; for he's not the firſt that has been waited
on by a Corporation in their Robes; for in the
Reign of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> a Fellow, who wore his Hat
button'd up on one ſide, and a Feather therein,
like a Tooth-drawer, with a Roſe and Crown
on his Breaſt for a Badge, got a Licenſe to make
a Show of a great <hi>APE</hi> about the Country:
And coming to a certain Town, [☞Whether
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1100800900:6"/>
               <hi>Banbury,</hi> or not, I can't tell] they beat a Drum
about to give Notice, That there was a very
witty Ape to be ſeen; but the Towns-People,
being poor, thought it not worth their while
to ſee this ſight; upon which the Fellow was
enraged, and was reſolved to put a Trick upon
them; and thereupon ſends the following War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to the Worſhipful the Mayor.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">THeſe are to Require you, and every one
of you, with your Wives and Families,
(upon ſight hereof) to make your perſonal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
before the Queen's Ape, who is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Rank and Quality, and of vaſt Parts, he
having been bred at an Univerſity; and is to
viſit moſt Parts of the Kingdom, that by his
Converſation with the Queen's Subjects, he may
be the better enabled to diſcover their Fidelity and
Loyalty. Hereof fail not at your Peril.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When Mr. Mayor had open'd the Warrant, he
(who always did what he pleas'd) holds it topſie
turvy, and after ſome thoughts thereon, ſends
his Maid to the further end of the Town, for a
Shoemaker to come and read it. When he heard
the Contents, he ſummon'd his Brethren the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
to the Town-Hall, to conſult of this
weighty Affair; where they ſat looking on one
another for ſome time, not knowing what to
ſay: At length the youngeſt Alderman, ſtanding
up, ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, If I may ſpeak without Offence,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1100800900:7"/>
               <hi>I'll give you my Opinion in this Matter. — Speak on,</hi>
ſays Mr. Mayor, <hi>for though you are but a young Officer,
you may ſpeak as much Senſe as any of us. — Well
then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my humble Opinion is, That this Ape-Fellow
is a ſawcy Knave, and only deſigns to make our Town
ridiculous: For was it ever known, that a Warrant ſhould
be ſent, without either Name or Date, to a Mayor of a
Town, who is the Queen's Lieutenant; and that he, and his
Brethren, their Wives and Children, ſhould be commanded
to appear before a</hi> Jackanapes? <hi>My Council is therefore,
That you take him and his Ape, and whip the whole Tribe
out of Town, which will be much to your Credit and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The Words were ſcarce ſpoke, e're a grave Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
reply'd, <hi>Hold, Friend, you have ſpoke little leſs
than Treaſon; Remember 'tis the Queen's Ape. — True,
Brother,</hi> quoth the Mayor, <hi>therefore it behoves us to take
care what we ſay in this troubleſom Buſineſs. — Marry,</hi>
ſays another grave Senior, <hi>we may ſee by the Feather in
his Cap, and the Badge he wears, that he is the Queen's
Man; and who knows what an Injury he may do us poor
Men in the Country for contemning the Warrant? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us e'ne go and ſee the Ape; 'tis but</hi> 2 d. <hi>apiece, and
no doubt but the Queen will tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it well, when ſhe hears we
have ſhown ſo much Reverence to her Ape.</hi> — Upon this
Speech the Aſſembly reſolved to pay the Ape a Viſit,
and ordered the Town-Clerk to acquaint the Queen's
Man therewith.</p>
            <p>Next Day the Mayor and Aldermen in their Robes,
(<hi>the Serjeant carrying the Mace before them, their Recorder
being at the Head of them</hi>) with whole Droves of
Townſmen, and their Wives, <hi>&amp;c. attended the Ape at
his Inn</hi>; where they found him ſitting on a Table;
Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> preſented him with Wine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> off his Hat,
and made a Leg; but Pag did not mind him. Next came
Mrs. <hi>Mayoreſs,</hi> in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Apron, and made <hi>Pug</hi> a
fine low Courtiſie; upon which he put out his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and made a Mouth. — <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> quoth ſhe, <hi>I think in
my Conſcience, the Queen's Ape mocks me. — Sirrah,</hi> ſays
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1100800900:8"/>
the Mayor, <hi>I ſee thy ſawcineſs, and I'll make thee to know
that the Woman, whom thou mockeſt, is my Wife, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Woman, and a Midwife, and one who is old enough
to be thy Mother.</hi> And thereupon going to his Tutor,
<hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do you allow your Ape to abuſe my Wife? — 
No,</hi> quoth he. — <hi>Truly,</hi> ſays the Mayor, <hi>there's ſufficient
witneſs that ſaw him make Mops and Mows at her.</hi> — The
Tutor thereupon gave poor <hi>Pug</hi> half a Dozen ſmart
Laſhes with his Whip, which made his Teeth chatter;
upon which Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> cried out, <hi>Enough, Enough:
Good Sir, you have done like a Gentleman: I deſire you
