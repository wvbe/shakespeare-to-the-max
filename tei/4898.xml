            <p>EVERY one who amuſes himſelf with writing Works of Imagination, has a View to either Profit or Fame. Though the Author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Trifles does not pretend to be above ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, yet he hopes his Anxiety is not powerful enough to render him unhappy one Moment, ſhould he be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſappointed. He is ſenſible how much Succeſs depends upon Circumſtances. A Poem muſt be read before it can be admired; nay more, it muſt be read with ſome Share of that Temper and Spirit in which it was written, or it will appear languid. A good Character, or a bad one, given by thoſe Gentlemen
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1003600100:3"/>who take upon themſelves the Office of Public Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in literary Matters, will frequently, at leaſt for a Time, determine its Fate. As he is entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, he is not in any Dread of a partial Sentence. If theſe Poems are worthleſs, let them reſt in that Oblivion which is the utmoſt Happineſs Unworthineſs can know: if the contrary happens to be the Caſe, he has no doubt but their Merits will be ſeen and acknowledged by every one whom Heaven has bleſt with Taſte and Judgment ſufficient to form the true Critic.</p>

                  <p>THERE is not any Thing, I believe, which calls forth the melancholy and ſympathetic Paſſions more forcibly than a Sight of thoſe Men who have once been great or famous, and have outlived their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Faculties. Who can forbear ſighing when he beholds a BELISARIUS? Whoſe Heart is not wrung when he views a SWIFT in his Dotage?—Reflections of this Kind gave Birth to the following Stanzas. They were written upon an old Man in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Village, whoſe Strength, Activity, and ruſtic Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, were once the frequent Admiration of his Fellow-Swains; and when Age had deprived
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1003600100:16"/>him of them, and rendered him feeble and decrepid, the Remembrance of his paſt Exploits was often the Subject of their Exclamations, and the honeſt Motive of their Pity and Condolence, as well as the frequent Topic of his own Lamentation. The Effect that this Remembrance had upon his Mind cannot, perhaps, be conveyed more feelingly than by informing the Reader that the Sentence which I have choſen for a Motto was common in his Mouth, and generally attended with a Sigh.</p>
