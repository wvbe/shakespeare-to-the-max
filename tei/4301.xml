            <head>Obſervations on the <hi>Fifth Article of the Treaty of UNION,</hi> humbly offered to the Conſideration of the Parliament, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Foreign Ships.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Matter of Difficulty upon this Head, I take to be as follows. — By the Article, all Ships, any of whoſe Owners were Foreigners at the Signing of the Treaty, ſhall be Deem'd ſtill Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bottoms within the Terms of the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this is plain, Moſt of the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping employ'd on the South-Eaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bottoms, and ſeverals of them own'd by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, principally <hi>Dutch.</hi> Now, as <hi>England</hi> is very careful to Encourage her own Shipping; and as <hi>Britain</hi> will after the Union ſtill be ſo the Encreaſe, Employment and Building of Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Principal Foundations of her Wealth. — It would be hard to admit any Ships, which are Foreign built, to be free Ships in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when none that are ſo in <hi>England</hi> can be admitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> freely admits all Ships built in <hi>Scotland</hi> to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0129701600:2"/>
be free in all the Ports and Trade of <hi>Britain;</hi> — Nay, to go further, <hi>England</hi> allows by the Union, even <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, if bought by <hi>Scots</hi> Men, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Scots</hi> Owners, to be free, which is more than any <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> can be allow'd. — Nay, If a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign built Ship lay now at <hi>Leith</hi> Road, and her Owners were all <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> ſhe would not be Deem'd a free Ship by the Union, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Owners would looſe the benefit of employing her; and the Reaſon of this is, to Encourage our own Shipping, on which ſo much depends, and this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will be plainly <hi>Scotland's</hi> at laſt.</p>
            <p>But the Objection here, is, We have a great many Ships in our Trade that are Foreign built, and that are chiefly own'd by <hi>Scots-men,</hi> but perhaps may have one or more Owners abroad; and it would be hard that theſe <hi>Scots-men</hi> ſhould loſe the Benefit of their Ships which they employ in the Trade of their Native Country, only becauſe they have ſome <hi>Dutch-men</hi> concerned with them, — when at the ſame time 'tis plain, that if theſe <hi>Dutch-men</hi> were not concerned, the Trade of <hi>Scotland</hi> would with great difficulty be carried on.</p>
            <p>The Expedient propoſed for this, as I meet with it, is, That a reaſonable time ſhould be given for the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> to buy out their <hi>Dutch</hi> Owners or ſell their own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0129701600:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Or that it ſhould have been ſaid, All Ships &amp;c. whoſe Owners were <hi>Scots-men,</hi> at the End, or Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Treaty, &amp;c. ſince till the Treaty is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, every <hi>Scots-man</hi> has a Right to employ any Ship whatever.</p>
            <p>To Anſwer this, I crave leave to ſay, That this tho plauſible in its ſelf, has yet Inconveniencies of a nature Intolerable, becauſe by this, any Man in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may in the name of <hi>Scotſmen,</hi> Buy what number of Ships in <hi>Holland</hi> they pleaſe, and at the end of the Union, they become free Ships, to the general Ruine of the Shipping in the whole Iſland.</p>
            <p>And this was Remarkably true, to <hi>England</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Loſs, when in the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War, the Ships taken from <hi>Holland</hi> as Prize, were made free, the People bought <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, cauſed ſham Privateers to take them, and for ſeveral years, ſome hundereds of them were Imployed in their Coal Trade, to the Ruine of the Town of <hi>Ipſwick,</hi> where all the large Coal Ships uſed to be Built, — which Loſs that Town never recovered.</p>
            <p>To give a time therefore, to have all Ships Own'd by <hi>Scotſmen</hi> come in to be free, is to open a Door to a Miſchief, which it cannot be deſired, <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſuffer in Trade; and the value now ſuppoſed to be Toucht here, is but very ſmall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0129701600:4"/>
All that I can ſee in this, is, That a <hi>Medium</hi> be found out, which if it muſt be, tho I do not grant that neceſſity neither, <hi>is this,</hi> That <hi>at the time of the Treaty,</hi> the MAJOR PART of ſuch Veſſel did belong to the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I confeſs this ſeems to have ſome colour of Reaſon in it, that the Majority ſhould Denominate the whole, and I would hope <hi>England</hi> would not Diſpute it, ſince they do not deny any Foreigners, Holding or Owning any Share of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, but the Legitimacy of the Veſſel conſiſts in her Bottom.</p>
            <p>Now if the Majority of Owners as to the Value, I mean, were not <hi>Scots,</hi> no Ship can be accounted Legitimate. If a <hi>Scots</hi> Merchant Owns ⅜ of a Ship, and a <hi>Dutchman</hi> ⅝ ſhe cannot be accounted in Reaſon, any thing but a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, eſpecially when her Bottom is <hi>Dutch</hi> too, for the Denomination muſt go with the Major; and it's not the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant is a part Owner of the <hi>Scotſman</hi>'s Ship, but the <hi>Scotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is a part Owner of the <hi>Dutchman</hi>'s Ship.</p>
            <p>This ſmall <hi>Medium,</hi> I think, will reduce this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to a Square, and an Explanatorie Clauſe to that purpoſe, will in two Lines determine that Point.</p>
            <closer>All which is Humbly Remitted to the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</closer>
