OR, Nothing got by Cheating.
A TRUE BALLAD.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>A Miller there was, and he liv'd at his Mill,</l>
               <l>Which was built on a ſtream at the foot of a hill.</l>
               <l>He cheated all day and he drank all the night,</l>
               <l>For cheating and drinking was all his delight;</l>
               <l>While his moments in tippling unheeded did roll,</l>
               <l>This ſtill was his ſaying—be ſure to take toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whoever ſent corn to be ground at his Mill,</l>
               <l>He ſpoilt it, he chang'd it, he pilfer'd it ſtill;</l>
               <l>In villainy thus a long courſe he did run,</l>
               <l>For he fancy'd that cheating was very good fun.</l>
               <l>He car'd not what came of his body or ſoul,</l>
               <l>While this was his ſaying—I'll always take toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If you ſent a full Sack of good corn to his Mill,</l>
               <l>A Sack of bad flour he ſent you back ſtill,</l>
               <l>For he fancy'd that when he the wheat had once ground,</l>
               <l>The difference wou'd not be eaſily found:</l>
               <l>Now to change good for bad was as if he had ſtole,</l>
               <l>And he not only chang'd it—but always took toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Neighbours oft ſent him their Money to pay,</l>
               <l>But he always refus'd it and ſent it away;</l>
               <l>Had he taken the Money he'd have got but his due,</l>
               <l>But the payment that's lawful for him wou'd not do;</l>
               <l>What was honeſtly his he deſpis'd on the whole,</l>
               <l>Becauſe he got more from—the taking of toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One day when a Farmer had ſent a good ſack</l>
               <l>Of his Corn to be ground, and then ſent for it back;</l>
               <l>He call'd to his Man and demanded ſtraitway,</l>
               <l>If for this he had taken the toll on that day.</l>
               <l>The Man ſtrait declar'd, that tho' nought he had ſtole,</l>
               <l>Yet that he had taken—the full of the toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He then call'd his maid, and he aſk'd her good lack</l>
               <l>If toll ſhe had taken from that very ſack;</l>
               <l>She declar'd that ſhe had, but he fond of pelf,</l>
               <l>Said, for fear that you ſhou'd not, I'll take it myſelf;</l>
               <l>So raſhly he ventur'd the loſs of his Soul,</l>
               <l>And mended his practice—by thrice taking toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length he grew bolder and bolder in ſin,</l>
               <l>And cheating he deeper and deeper got in;</l>
               <l>Of Satan, alas! he was quite at the beck,</l>
               <l>Where he firſt took a pound he at length took a peck,</l>
               <l>No church he frequented to pray for his Soul,</l>
               <l>Who wou'd might go thither—ſo he could take toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Farmer, the Squire, the Parſon likewiſe</l>
               <l>Agreed to obſerve him with ſtill keener Eyes;</l>
               <l>But the Juſtice he cheated to ſuch a degree,</l>
               <l>That no longer with patience his frauds cou'd he ſee;</l>
               <l>So he ſent him to jail by the LAW's juſt controul,</l>
               <l>And a MITTIMUS paid him—for taking of toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come all honeſt Millers whoever you be,</l>
               <l>And liſten to counſel that's given by me;</l>
               <l>Be content, like fair tradeſmen with moderate gains,</l>
               <l>And look for a lawful reward of your pains;</l>
               <l>If 'tis paid you in money be pleas'd on the whole</l>
               <l>And if you take any—take moderate toll.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O! ſeek not each way to defraud that you can,</l>
               <l>Nor cheat in the flour, nor cheat in the bran;</l>
               <l>Be honeſt and all Men will flock to your Mill,</l>
               <l>And tho' others want cuſtom, yours ne'er will ſtand ſtill.</l>
               <l>And when to your MAKER you give up your ſoul,</l>
               <l>You'll rejoice that you always—took moderate toll.</l>
