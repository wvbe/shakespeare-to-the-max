                  <p>Pray you away; why Children?  Gods son:  what do you meane? 
Mary that you shall not speake the Prologue Sir. 
Why?  do you hope to speake it? 
Aye, and I think I have most right to it; I am sure I studied it first. 
That is all one, if the Author think I can speake it better. 
I plead possession of the Cloake:  Gentles, your suffrages for 
Gods sake. Why Children, are you not ashamed?  come in there.

                  <p>'Slid, I will play nothing in the Play:  unless I speake it. 
Why?  Will you stand to most voyces of the Gentlemen?  let that 
decide it. 
O no Sir Gallant; you presume to have the start of us there, and 
that makes you offer so bountifully. 
No, would I were whipt, if I had any such thought; trye it by 
Lots either. 
Faith, I dare tempt my Fortune, in a greater venter then this. 
Well said resolute Iack:  I am Content too; so we draw first 
make the Cuts. 
But will you not snatch my Cloake while I am stooping? 
No, we scorne trechery. 
Which Cut shall speake it? 
The shortest. 
Agreed:  Draw. — The shortest is come to the shortest. 
Fortune was not altogether blind in this:  Now Children, I hope I shall 
go forward without your Enuy. 
A spight of all mischeiuous lucke:  I was once plucking at the 
other. 
Stay Iack:  'Slid I will do somewhat now afore I go in, though it 
be nothing but to reuenge myself on the AUTHOR; since I speake not his 
Prologue.  I will go tell all the Argument of his Play aforehand, and so 
stale his Inuention to the Auditory before it come foorth.

the other two Boyes interrupt him.</stage>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W</speaker>
                  <p>O do not so. 
By no meanes. 
First the Title of his Play is CYNTHIAS Reuels, as 
any man (that hath hope to be sau'd by his Booke)  can witnesse; the 
Scene, GARGAPHIA:  which I do vehemently suspect for some 
Fustian Countrey; but let that vanish.  Here is the Court of Cynthia; 
whither he brings Cupid (trauailing on foote) resolu'd to turne Page: 
By the way Cupid meetes with Mercury, (as that is a thing to be noted, 
take any of our Play-bookes without a Cupid, or a Mercury in it, 
and burne it for an Heretique in Poetry) — Pray thee let me alone: 
Mercurie, he, (in the nature of a Coniurer) rayses up Echo:  who weepes 
over her Loue, or Daffodill Narcissus, a little; sings; cursses the Spring 
wherein the pretty foolish Gentleman melted himself away:  and there is 
an end of her — Now, I am to informe you, that Cupid, and Mercury 
do both become Pages:  Cupid attends on Philautia, or Selfe-loue, 
a Court-Lady:  Mercury followes Hedon the voluptuous Courtier; 
one that rankes himself even with Anaides, or the impudent Gallant, 
(and, that is my part:)  a Fellow that keepes Laughter the daughter of 
Folly (a wenche in Boyes attire) to wayte on him — These, in the 
Court, meete with Amorphus, or the Deformed, a Trauailer that hath 
drunke of the Fountaine, and there tels the wonders of the Water; they 
presently dispatch away their Pages with Bottles to fetch of it, and themselves 
go to visit the Ladyes:  But I should have tolde you — Looke, 
these Emets put me out here:  that with this Amorphus, there comes along 
along a Citizens heire, Asotus, or the Prodigall, who (in Imitation of 
the Traueller, that hath the Whetstone, following him) entertaines 
the Begger, to be his Attendant. — Now the Nymphes, who are 
Mistresses, to these Gallants, are Philautia, Selfe-loue; Phantaste, 
A light Wittinesse; Argurion,  Money; and their Guardian, Mother Moria; 
or Mistresse Folly. — 
Pray thee no more. 
There Cupid strikes Money in loue with the Prodigall; 
makes her doate upon him, give him Iewels, Bracelets, Carkanets, &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
all which (he most ingeniously) departs withall, to be made knowne to 
the other Ladyes, and Gallants; and in the heate of this, encreases his 
traine with the Foole to follow him, as well as the Begger — By 
this time your Begger begins to waite close, who is return'd with the 
rest of his fellow Bottle-men — There they all drinke saue Argurion, 
who is falne into a sodaine Apoplexy — 
Stop his mouth. 
And then there is a retir'd Scholler there, you would not 
wish a thing to be better contemn'd of a Society of Gallants, then it is: 
and he applyes his seruice (good Gentleman) to the Lady Arete, or 
Virtue, a poore Nymph of Cynthias traine, that is scarce able to buy 
herself a Gowne, you shall see her play in a Blacke Roabe anone:  A 
creature, that (I assure you) is no lesse scorn'd, then himself.  Where 
am I now?  at a stand? 
Come, leaue at last yet. 
O, the Night is come, (it was somewhat darke, me thought) 
and Cynthia intends to come foorth:  That helpes it a little yet.  All 
the Courtiers must prouide for Reuels; they conclude upon a Masque, 
the deuise of which, is — what will you rauish me?  that each of these 
Vices, being to appeare before Cynthia, would seeme other then 
indeed they are:  and therefore assume the most neighbouring Virtues 
as their masquing Habites — I would crye a Rape but that you are 
Children. 
Come, we will have no more of this Anticipation; to give them 
the Inuentory of their Cates aforehand, were the discipline of a Tauerne, 
and not fitting this Presence. 
Tut, this was but to shew us the happinesse of his Memory; 
I thought at first he would have playde the Ignorant Critique 
with euery thing along as he had gone; I expected some such Deuise. 
O you shall see me do that rarely; lend me thy Cloake. 
Soft Sir, you will speake my Prologue in it? 
No, would I might neuer stirre then. 
Lend it him, lend it him: 
Well, you have sworne? 
I have.  Now Sir; suppose I am one of your Gentile Auditors, 
that am come in (hauing paide my money at the Doore with 
much adoe) and here I take my place, and sit downe:  I have my three 
sorts of Tabacco, in my Pocket, my Light by me; and thus I Begin. 
By Gods son, I wonder that any man is so madde, to come to see these 
raskally Tits play here — They do act like so many Wrens or Pismires — 
not the fifth part of a good Face amongst them all — And 
then their Musique is abhominable — able to stretch a mans Eares 
worse, then ten — Pillories, and their Ditties — most lamentable 
things, like the pittifull Fellowes that makes them — Poets.  By Gods 
lid, if it were not for Tabaco — I think — the very stench of 
them would poyson me, I should not dare to come in at their Gates — 
A man were better visit fifteene Iayles — or a dozen or two of 
Hospitals — then once aduenture to come neare them.  How is it? 
well? 
Excellent; give me my Cloake. 
Stay; you shall see me do another now:  but a more sober, or 
better-gather'd Gallant; that is (as it may be thought) some Friend, 
or well-wisher to the House:  And here I Enter. 
What?  upon the Stage too? 
Yes:  and I step foorth like one of the Children, and aske 
you; Would you have Stoole Sir? 
A Stoole Boy? 
Aye Sir, if you will give me sixe Pence, I will fetch you one. 
For what I pray thee?  what shall I do with it? 
O God Sir!  will you betraye your Ignorance so much? 
Why, throne yourself in state on the Stage, as other Gentlemen vse 
Sir. 
Away Wag:  what wouldst thou make an Implement 
of me?  Slid the Boy takes me for a peice of Prospectiue (I holde my 
life) or some silke Curtine, come to hang the Stage here:  Sir Cracke 
I am none of your fresh Pictures, that vse to beautifie the decay'd dead 
Arras, in a publique Theater. 
It is a signe Sir, you put not that Confidence in your good 
Clothes, and your better Face, that a Gentleman should do Sir.  But I 
pray you Sir, let me be a Sutor to you, that you will quit our Stage then, 
and take a Place, the Play is instantly to begin. 
Most willingly my good wag:  but I would speake with 
your Author, where is he? 
Not this way, I assure you Sir, we are not so officiously befriended 
by him, as to have his Presence in the Tiring-house, to 
prompt us aloud, stampe at the Booke-holder, sweare for our Properties, 
cursse the poore Tire-man, rayle the Musique out of tune, and 
sweat for euery veniall trespasse we commit, as some Author would, if 
he had such fine Ingles as we:  well, it is but our bard Fortune. 
Nay Crack be not dishartned. 
Not I Sir:  but if you please to conferre with our Author by 
Attorney, you may Sir:  our proper self here stands for him. 
Troth, I have no such serious affayre to negotiate with him; 
but what may very safely be turn'd upon thy trust:  It is in the generall 
behalfe of this fayre Society here, that I am to speake; at least the 
more iudicious part of it:  which seemes much distasted with the the immodest 
and obscene writing of many, in their Playes.  Besides, they could 
wish, your Poets would leaue to be Promooters of other mens Iests; 
and to Way-lay all the stale Apophthegmes, or old Bookes, they can 
heare of (in Print or otherwise) to farce their Scenes withall:  That they 
would not so penuriously gleane wit, from euery Landresse, or Hackney-man; 
or deriue their best grace (with seruile Imitation) from 
Common Stages, or Obseruation of the Company, they conuerse with; 
as if their Inuention liu'd wholy upon another mans Trecher.  Againe; 
that feeding their friends with nothing of their owne, but what 
they have twise, or thrise Cook'd) they should not wantonly give out, how 
soone they had drest it; nor how many Coaches came to cary away the 
broken-meate, besides Hobby-horses and Foote cloth Nags. 
So Sir, this is all the Reformation you seeke? 
It is:  do not you think it necessary to be practisd, my little 
wag? 
Yes; where, there is any such ill-habited Custome receiu'd. 
O, I had almost forgot it too:  they say, the Vmbræ, or Ghosts 
of some three or foure Playes, departed a dozen yeares since, have been 
seene walking on your Stage here; Take heed Boy, if your House be 
haunted with such Hob-goblins, it will fright away all your Spectators 
quickly. 
Good Sir, But what will you say now, if a Poet (vntoucht with 
any breath of this disease) finde Gods Tokens upon you, that are of 
the Auditory?  As some one Ciuet-Wit among you, that knowes no other 
Learning, then the price of Satten and Veluets; nor other Perfection, 
then the wearing of a Neate Sute; and yet will censure as desperately 
as the most profest Critique in the house:  presuming, his Cloathes, 
should beare him out in it.  Another (whom it hath pleas'd Nature 
to furnish with more Beard, then Brayne) prunes his Mustaccio; 
lispes; and (with some score of affected Oathes, sweares downe all that sit 
about him; That the olde Hieronimo, (as it was first acted) was 
the only best, and Iudiciously-pend Play, of Europe.  A thirde 
great-bellied Iugler talkes of twenty yeares since, and when Monsieur 
was here; and would enforce all Witte to be of that fashion, because 
his Doublet is still so.  A fourth mis-calles all by the name of Fustian, 
that his grounded Capacity cannot aspire to.  A fifth only 
shakes his Bottle Head, and out of his Corky Braine, squeezeth out 
a pittifull-learned Face, and is silent. 
By my faith, Iack, you have put me downe:  I would I knew 
how to get off with any indifferent Grace:  Here take your Cloake, and 
promise some satisfaction in your Prologue, or (I will be sworne) we have 
mard all.

Trident; nor Apolloes Bowe; no, not you?  Alasse your palmes 
(Iupiter knowes) they are as tender as the foote of a foundred 
Nag, or a Ladies face new Mercuried; they will touch nothing.

                  <p>Daring?  O Ianus, what a word is there?  why my light 
fether-heeld Cousse, what are you, any more then my vncle 
Ioues Pandar, a Lackey that runs on errands for him, and can 
whisper a light message to a loose wenche with some round 
volubility, waite at a table with a Trencher, and warble upon a 
Crowde a little; One that sweepes the Gods drinking roome 
euery morning, and sets the Cushions in order againe which 
they threw one at anothers head ouernight?  Here is the Catalogue 
of all your Imploiments now.  O no, I erre:  you have the 
Marshalling of all the Ghostes too, that passe the Stigian ferry; 
and I suspect you for a share with the olde Sculler there, if the 
truth were knowne; but let that scape:  one other peculiar vertue 
you possesse, in lifting or Lieger-du-maine (which few of the 
house of Heauen have else besides) I must confesse; But (me thinks) 
that should not make you set such an extream distance 
twixt yourself and others, that we should be said to ouer-dare 
in speaking to your nimble Deity:  So Hercules might 
challenge a priority of us both, because he can throw the Barre 
farther, or lift more Ioyndstooles at the armes end then we.  If 
this might carry it; then we (who have made the whole body 
of Diuinity tremble at the twange of our Bowe, and inforste 
Saturnius himself to lay by his curld front, Thunder, and three 
forkd-fiers, and put on a Masking sute, too light for a reueller 
of eighteene to be seene in —

                  <p>O no, I remember it freshly, and by a particular instance; 
for my mother Venus (at the same time) but stoupt to 
imbrace you, and (to speake by Metaphore) you borrowed a 
Girdle of hers, as you did Ioues Scepter (while he was laughing) 
and would have done his thunder too, but that, it was too 
hote for your itching fingers. 
Faith (to recouer thy good thoughts) I will discouer my 
whole proiect.  The Huntresse and queene of these groues, 
Diana (in regarde of some black and enuious slaunders howerly 
breathd against her for her deuine iustice on Acteon as she 
pretends) hath here in the vale of Gargaphy proclaimd a solemne 
reuels, which she will grace with the full and royall expence 
of one of her cleerest moones:  In which time it shall be lawfull 
for all sorts of ingenuous persons, to visite her pallace, to court 
her Nimphes, to exercise all varietie of generous and noble pastimes, 
as well to intimate how farre she treads such malitious 
imputations beneath her, as also to shew how cleere her beauties 
are from the least wrinckle of Austerity, they may be 
chardgd with.

where (if my bowe holde, and my shafts flye but with halfe

I shall really redeeme the minutes I have lost by their so long

hand to take of thy bounties.  By the puritie of my taste, here 
is most Ambrosiack water; I will sup of it againe.  By thy fauor 
swete Founte.  See, the water (a more running, subtile, and humorous 
Nimphe then she)  permits me to touche, and handle 
her:  what should I inferre?  If my behauiours had been of a 
cheape, or customary garbe; my Accent, or phrase, vulgar; my

(with some change of coullor) have suspected my faculties:  but 
(knowing myself an Essence so sublimated, and refin'de by 
Trauaile; of so studied, and well exercisde a gesture; so alone 
in fashion, able to make the face of any States-man liuing, and 
to speake the meere extraction of language; One that hath 
now made the sixth returne upon venter; and was your first

whose Optiques have drunke the spirit of beauty, in some eight 
score and eighteene Princes Courts, where I have resided, 
and been there fortunate in the Amours of three hundred, 
fortie, and fiue Ladies (all nobly discended) whose names I have 
in Catalogue:  to conclude; in all so happy, as even Admiration 
herself doth seeme to fasten her kisses upon me:  Certes I do 
neither see, nor feele, nor taste, nor sauor, the least steame, or 
fume of a reason, that should inuite this foolish fastidious 
Nymph so peeuishly to abandon me:  well let the memory of 
her fleete into Ayre; my thoughts and I am for this other Element, 
water.

drunke but water in any of his Compositions.

remnant of Spanish, or Italian?  that would indifferently expresse 
my languages now, mary then, if he should fall out to be 
Ignorant, it were both hard, and harshe.  How else?  step into 
some discourse of State, and so make my induction?  that were 
above him too; and out of his element I feare Faine to have seen 
him in Venice?  or Padua?  or some face neare his in simillitude? 
 it is too pointed, and open.  No:  it must be a more queint, and collaterall 
deuise:  As — stay;  to frame some encomiastique speach 
upon this our Metropolis, or the wise Magistrates thereof, in 
which pollitique number,  it is ods but his father fild up a rome? 
descend into a perticuler admiration of their Iustice; for the due 
measuring of Coales, burning of Cans, and such like?  As also 
their religion, in pulling downe a superstitious Crosse, and aduancing 
a Venus; or Priapus, in place of it?  ha?  it will do well.  Or 
to talke of some Hospitall, whose walls record his father a BENEFACTOR? 
or of so many Buckets bestowd on his parish 
church in his life time, with his name at length (for want of 
armes) trickt upon them; Any of these?  or to praise the cleanesse 
of the streete wherein he dwelt, or the prouident painting of 
his posts against he should have been Pretor, or (leauing his 
parent) come to some speciall ornament about himself, as his 
Rapier, or some other of his accountrements?  I have it:  Thankes 
gracious Minerua.

                  <p>I think I shall affect you sir, this last speach of yours 
hath begun to make you deare to me.

                  <p>O God Sir, I would there were any thing in me Sir, that 
might appeare worthy the least worthines of your woorth Sir, 
I protest Sir, I should endeuour to shew it Sir, with more then 
common regarde Sir.

                  <p>Both your desert, and your endeuors are plentifull, 
suspect them not:  but your sweete disposition to trauaile (I 
assure you) hath made you another My-self in mine eye, and 
strooke me enamour'd on your beauties. 
</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>F</speaker>
                  <p>I would I were the fairest Lady of Fraunce for your

                  <p>O you should digresse from yourself els:  for (beleeue 
it) your Trauaile is your only thing that rectifies, or (as the Italian 
says) 8vi 8rendi 8pronto 8all' 8Attioni, makes you fit for Action.

                  <p>Charge?  why it is nothing for a gentleman that goes 
priuate, as yourself, or so; my Intelligence shall quitt my 
charge at all times:  Good faith, this Hat hath possest mine eye 
exceedingly; it is so prettie, and fantastique; what?  is it a Beauer.

company of this scholler here?  I will bring you knowne to 
gallants as Anaides, Hedon the courtier, and others, whose societie 
shall render you grac'de, and respected; this is a triuiall

                  <p>Sir, shall I say to you for that Hat?  be not so sad, 
be not so sad; it is a Relique I could not so easily have departed 
with, but as the Hierogliphick of my affection; you shall alter it 
to what forme you please, it will take any block; I have varied 
it myself to the three thousandth time, and not so few:  It 
hath these vertues beside; your head shall not ake under it; nor 
your braine leaue you, without licence; It will preserue your 
complexion to eternitie; for no beame of the Sunne (should 
you weare it der Zona Torrida) hath force to approch it by 
two ells.  It is proofe against thunder, and enchantment:  and 
was given me by a great man (in Russia) as an especially-priz'd 
present; and constantly affirm'd to be the hat that accompanied 
the politique Vlisses, in his tedious, and ten yeares Trauailes.

his graces:  he doth (besides me) keepe a Barbar, and a Monkey: 
He has a ritch wrought Waste-coate to intertaine his visitants 
in, with a Cap almost sutable:  His Curtaines and Bedding are 
thought to be his owne; his bathing Tub is not suspected.  He 
loues to have a Fencer, a Pedant, and a Musitian seene in his 
lodging a mornings.

                  <p>Fye no:  himself is a Rimer, and that is a thought better 
then a Poet:  he is not lightly within to his Mercer, no, 
though he come when he takes Phisique, which is commonly 
after his play.  He beates a Tayler very well, but a Stocking-seller 
admirably; and so consequently any one he owes money 
to, that dares not resist him.  He neuer makes generall inuitement, 
but against the publishing of a new Sute, mary then, you 
shall have more drawne to his lodging, then come to the launching 
of some three ships; especially if he be furnishd with 
supplies for the retiring of his olde Ward-robe from pawne; 
if not, he does hire a stock of Apparell, and some forty or fiftie 
pound in Gould for that forenoone to shew:  He is thought 
a very necessary Perfume for the Presence, and for that only 
cause welcome thither:  six Millaners shops affoorde you not 
the like sent.  He courts Ladies with how many great Horse he 
hath rid that morning, or how oft he has done the whole, or 
the halfe Pommado in a seuen-night before; and sometime 
venters so far upon the vertue of his Pomander, that he dares 
tell them, how many shirts he has sweat at Tennis that weeke, 
but wiselye conceales so many dozen of Balls he is on the 
score.  Here he comes that is all this.

Sence with the Lillies of your hand; but now I will taste the Roses of 
your lip; and (withall) kisse her:  to which she cannot but blushingly 
answeare:  Nay now you are too Ambitious.  And then

thus:  I do wish myself one of my Mistris Ciopino's.  Another 
demaunds:  Why would he be one of his Mistris Ciopinos?  A third 
answeres, Because he would make her higher.  A fourth shall say, 
That will make her proud.  And a fifth shall conclude:  Then do I 
prophesie, Pride will have a fall:  and he shall give it her.

Pride and Ignorance (I meane of such a Courtier, who is (indeed) 
but the Zani to an exact Courtier) mary, the rest come somwhat 
after the Ordinary Gallant.  It is Impudence itself Anaides; one, 
that speakes all that comes in his cheekes, and will blush no more 
then a Sackbut.  He lightly occupies the Iesters roome at the 
table, and keeps laughter,  Gelaia (a wench in pages atire) following 
him in place of a Squire, whom he (now and then) tickles with 
some strange ridiculous stuffe, vttered (as his land came to him) 
by chance:  He will censure or discourse of any thing, but as absurdly 
as you would wishe:  His fashion is not to take knowledge 
of him that is beneath him in cloathes; He neuer drinkes 
below the Salt:  He does naturally admire his wit, that weares 
Gold-lace, or Tissue; Stabs any man that speakes more contemptibly 
of the Scholler then he.  He is a great proficient in all 
the illiberall Sciences, as Cheating, Drinking, Swaggering, 
Whoring, and such like; neuer kneeles, but to pledge Health's; 
nor praies, but for a Pipe of pudding Tabaco.  He will blaspheame 
in his shirt; The oaths which he vomits at one supper, 
would maintain a Towne of garrison in good swearing a twelue-moneth: 
One other geniune quality he has, which crownes 
all these; and that is this; to a Friend in want, he will not depart 
with the weight of a soldard Groat, least the world might 
censure him prodigall, or report him a Gull:  Mary, to his Cocatrice 
or Punquetto; halfe a dozen Taffata gownes or Sattin Kirtles, 
in a paire or two of moneth's, why they are nothing.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>E</speaker>
                  <p>Plant yourself there Sir:  And obserue me.  You shall 
now, as well be the Ocular as the Eare-witnesse, how clearely 
I can resell that Paradox, or rather Pseudodoxe of those, which 
holde the face to be the Index of the minde, which (I assure 
you) is not so, in any Politique creature; for instance, I will now 
give you the particuler, and distinct face of euery your most 
noted Species of persons; As your Marchant, your Scholler, your 
Soldier, your Lawyer, Courtier, &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi>.  And each of these so truly, as 
you would sweare (but that your eye sees the variation of the 
lineament) it were my most proper, and Genuine aspect: First, 
for your Marchants, or Citty face; It is thus:  a dull plodding 
face; still looking in a direct line, forward:  There is no great 
matter in this face.  Then have you your Students, or Academique 
face, which is here, an honest, simple, and Methodicall 
face; But somewhat more spread then the former.  The third 
is your Soldiers face:  A menacing, and astounding face, that 
lookes broade, and bigge:  the grace of this face consists much 
in a Beard.  The Anti face to this, is your Lawyers face; a contracted, 
subtile, and Intricate face:  full of quirkes, and turnings; 
A Labyrinthæan face, now angularly, now circularly, euery way 
aspected.  Next is your Statists face, a serious, solempne, and 
supercilious face, ful of formall, and square grauity, the eye (for 
the most part) arteficially and deeply shadow'd, there is great 
iudgment requir'd in the making of this face.  But now to come 
to your face of faces; or Courtiers face:  it is of three sorts; (according 
to our subdiuision of a Courtier; Elementary, Practique, 
and Theorique:  your Courtier Theorique, is he that hath arriu'd 
to his fardest, and doth now know the Court rather by speculation, 
then practise; and this is his face:  A fastidious, and oblique 
face; that lookes, as it went with a Vice, and were screw'd thus. 
Your Courtier Practique is he that is yet in his Path, his Course, 
his Way, and hath not toucht the Puntillio or point of hopes; this 
face is here:  A most promising, open, smooth, and ouerflowing 
face, that seemes as it would runne, and powre itself into you; 
your Courtier Elementary is one but newly entered, or as it were 
in the Alphabet Vt-re-mi-fa-sol-la, of Courtship:  Note well this 
face, for it is this you must practise.

                  <speaker>E</speaker>
                  <p>Aye; here after you may:  and it will not be altogether an 
vngratfull study.  For let your soule be assur'd of this (in any 
Ranke or profession whatsoeuer) the most generall, or Maior 
part of Opinion, goes with the face, and (simply) respects nothing 
else.  Therefore:  if that can be made, exactly, curiously, exquisitely, 
thoroughly, It is enough:  But (for the present) you shall 
only apply yourself to this face of the Elementary Courtier, A 
light, reuelling, and protesting face, now blushing, now smiling 
which you may helpe much with a wanton wagging of your 
head, thus; (a feather will teach you) or with kissing your finger 
that hath the Ruby, or playing with some string of your band, 
which is a most quaint kinde of Melancholy besides.  Where is 
your Page?  call for your Casting Bottle, and place your Mirror 
in your Hat, as I tolde you; so.  Come, looke not pale, obserue 
me:  set your face, and enter. 
O for some excellent Painter, to have ta'ne the copye 
of all these faces.

                  <p>A notable Finch.  One that hath newly entertain'd the 
Beggar to follow him, but cannot get him to wait neer inough. 
It is Asotus the heire of Philargirus:  but first I will give you the 
others Caracter, which may make his the clearer?  He that is 
with him is Amorphus, A Traueller, One so made out of the 
mixture and shreds of formes, that himself is truely deformed: 
He walkes most commonlye with a Cloue or Pick-toothe 
in his mouth, He is the very Minte of Complement; 
All his behauiours are printed, his face is another volume of 
Essayes; and his beard an Aristarchus.  He speakes all creame, 
skimd, and more affected then a dozen of waiting women; He is 
his owne promooter in euery place:  The wife of the Ordinary 
gives him his diet to maintaine her table in discourse, which 
(indeed) is a meere Tiranny over her other guests:  for he will 
vsurp all the talke:  Ten Cunstables are not so tedious.  He is no 
great shifter; once a yeare his Apparell is ready to reuolt;  He 
doth vse much to arbitrate quarrells, and fights himself exceeding 
well (out at a window.) He will lie cheaper then any 
Begger, and lowder then most Clockes; for which he is right 
properly accommodated to the Whetstone his page.  The other 
gallant is his Zani, and doth most of these tricks after him; sweats 
to imitate him in euery thing (to a haire) except a Beard, which 
is not yet extant:  he doth learne to eat Anchoues, and Caueare because 
he loues them, speakes as he speakes; lookes, walkes, goes 
so in Cloathes and fashion, is in all, as he were moulded of him. 
Marry (before they met) he had other very pretty sufficiencies, 
which yet he retaines some light Impression of:  As frequenting 
a dauncing schoole, and grieuously torturing strangers, 
with inquisition after his grace in his Galliard; He buyes a fresh 
acquaintance at any rate; his Eye, and his Raiment confer much 
together as he goes in the street; He treads nicely, like a fellow 
that walkes upon ropes, especially the first Sunday of his Silk-stockings, 
and when he is most neate and new, you shall stripp 
him with commendations.

                  <p>Criticus.  A creature of a most perfect and diuine temper; 
One, in whom the Humors and Elements are peaceably met, 
without æmulation of Precedencie: he is neither too fantastickly 
Melancholy; too slowly Plegmatick, too lightly Sanguine, 
or too rashly Cholerick, but in all, so composd and order'd; as it is 
cleare, Nature was about some full worke, she did more then 
make a man when she made him; His discourse is like his behauiour, 
vncommon, but not vnpleasing; he is prodigall of neither: 
He striues rather to be (that which men call) Iudicious, 
then to be thought so; and is so truely learned that he affects 
not to shew it:  He will think, and speak his thought, both freely; 
but as distant from deprauing any other mans Merrit, as proclaiming 
his owne:  For his valor, it is such, that he dares as little to 
offer an Iniury, as receiue one.  In sum, he hath a most Ingenious 
and sweet spirit, a sharp and season'd wit, a streight iudgement, 
and a stronge minde; constant and vnshaken:  Fortune 
could neuer breake him, or make him lesse, he counts it his 
pleasure to despise pleasures, and is more delighted with good 
deedes then Goods,  It is a competencie to him that he can be 
vertuous.  He doth neither couet, nor feare; he hath too much 
reason to do either:  and that commends all things to him.

                  <p>The fame:  A Nimph of a most wandering and giddy 
disposition, humourous as the Ayre, she will run from Gallant to 
Gallant (as they sit at Primero in the Presence) most strangely, 
and seldome stayes with any; She spreades as she goes:  To day 
you shall have her looke as cleare and fresh as the morning 
and to morrow as Melancholy as midnight.  She takes speciall 
pleasure in a close, obscure lodging, and for that cause visits 
the Cittie so often, where she has many secret and true concealing 
fauorites.  When she comes abroad she is more loose 
and scattering then dust, and will fly from place to place, as she 
were rapt with a whirle-winde.  Your young Student (for the 
most part) she affects not, onley salutes him, and away:  A Poet 
or a Philosopher she is hardly brought to take any notice of, no, 
though he be some part of an Alchimist.  She loues a Player, 
well; and a Lawyer infinitly:  but your Foole above all.  She can 
do much in the Court for the obtaining of any sute whatsoeuer, 
no doore but flies open to her; her presence is above a 
Charme:  The woorst in her is want of keeping state, and too 
much descending into inferior and base offices, She is for any 
course Imployment you will put upon her, as to be your 
Procurer or Pandar.

admires not herself for any one particularity, but for all; She 
is faire, and she knowes it; She has a pretty light wit too, and she 
knowes it;  She can daunce, and she knowes that too; play at 
Shittle-cock, and that too:  No quality she has, but she shall 
take a very particuler knowledge of, and most Lady-like 
commend it to you; you shall have her at any time read you 
the History of herself, and very subtilly runne over another 
Ladies sufficiences to come to her owne. 
She has a good superficiall iudgement in Painting; and would 
seeme to have so in Poetry.  A most compleate Lady in the opinion 
of some three beside herself.

Thauma, and others of that high sort.  These are priuately 
brought in by Moria in this licencious time, against her knowledge; 
and (like so many Meteors) will vanish when she 
appeares.

Haruest, sighing one to another, and gasping, as if each of them 
expected a Cock from the Fountaine, to be brought into his 
mouth; and (without we returne quickly) they are all (as a youth 
would say) no better then a few Trowts cast a shore, or a dish 
of Eeles in a Sand-bag.

                  <p>Sir, let not this discountenance, or dis-gallant you a 
whit, you must not sinke under the first disaster; It is with your 
young Grammattical Courtier, as with your Neophyte-Player, 
a thing vsuall to be daunted at the first presence, or enter-viewe: 
you saw, there was Hedon and Anaides, (far more practisd gallants 
then yourself) who were both out, to comfort you:  It is no 
disgrace, no more, then for your aduenturous Reueller to fall 
by some in-auspicious chance in his Galliard, or for some subtill 
Politician to vndertake the Bastinado, that the State might 
think worthely of him, and respect him as a man well beaten 
to the world.  What?  hath your Tayler prouided the property 
(we spake of) at your Chamber, or no?

of slic'd Caueare, or so, and after you shall practise an hower 
at your lodging, some fewe formes that I have remembred; If 
you had but (so farre) gathered your spirits to you, as to have 
taken up a Rushe (when you were out) and wagd it, thus; or 
clensde your teeth with it, or but turn'de aside, and fainde 
some businesse to whisper with your Page, till you had 
recouer'd yourself, or but found some slight staine in your

hath sufficiently whited your Face?  then (stifling a sigh or two, 
and closing your lippes) with a trembling boldnesse, and bolde

most elegant I warrant you:  O, I do fancie this geare that is 
long a comming, with an vnmeasurable strayne.

                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Yes faith:  me thinks thy seruant Hedon is nothing so 
obsequious to thee, as he was wont to be; I know not how, 
He is growne out of his Garbe a-late, he is warp't. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B</speaker>
                  <p>In truenesse, and so me thinks too, he is much conuerted. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P</speaker>
                  <p>Tut; let him be what he will, it is an Animall  I 
dreame not of.  This tire (me thinks) makes me looke very Ingenuously, 
quick, and spirited:  I should be some Laura, or some 
Delia me thinks.

               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>As I am wise (faire honors) that title she gaue him, to 
be her Ambition, spoild him:  Before, he was the most propitious, 
and obseruant young Nouice. —

the swaggering tilt-horse Anaides drawes with him there, has 
been the diuerter of him.

neuer dare to looke in a Mirror againe, if I respect ere a Marmaset 
of them all, otherwise, then I would a Fether, or my Shittle-cock, 
to make sport with, now and then.

                  <p>O fie on him:  he lookes like a Dutch Trumpetter in the 
battell of Lepanto, in the gallery yonder; and speakes to the tune 
of a country Lady, that comes euer in the rere ward, or traine of 
a Fashion.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Anaides?  you talk't of a tune Philautia, there is one 
speakes in a Key:  like the opening of some Iustices gate, or a 
Post-Boyes horne, as if his voyce fear'd an Arrest for some ill 
words it should give, and were loath to come forth. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, and he has a very imperfect face.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Like a squeez'd Orenge, sower, sower.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P</speaker>
                  <p>His Hand is too great too; by at least a strawes breadth. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Nay he has a woorse fault then that too. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P</speaker>

                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>That were a fault in a Lady rather then him:  No, they

the rest?

                  <p>Troth I made the motion to her Lady-ship for one to day

                  <speaker>Q</speaker>
                  <p>Mary the little, poore, plaine Gentleman in the black there. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Who?  Criticus?

                  <speaker>O</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, aye, he; A fellow that no body so much as lookt upon, 
or regarded, and she would have had me done him particuler 
grace. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>That was a true trick of yourself Moria, to perswade 
Argurion affect the scholler. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>O</speaker>
                  <p>Tut; but she shall be no chooser for me.  In good faith I 
like the Citizens sonne there Asotus, me thinks, none of 
them all come neare him. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Not Hedon? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>O</speaker>
                  <p>Hedon, in troth no.  Hedon is a pretty slight Courtier, 
and he weares his clothes well, and sometimes in fashion; marry 
his face is but indifferent, and he has no such excellent body. 
No; the other is a most delicate youth, a sweete face, a streight 
body, a well proportion'd legge, and foote, a white hand, a tender 
voyce. 
</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>P</speaker>
                  <p>How now Argurion? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>O you should have let her alone, she was bestowing a 
Coppy of him upon us. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P</speaker>
                  <p>Why she doates more palpably upon him, then ere his 
Father did upon her. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Beleeue me, the young gentleman deserues it; if she 
could doate more it were not amisse:  He is an exceeding proper 
youth, and would have made a most neate Barber-surgeon, 
if he had been put to it in time. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P</speaker>
                  <p>Say you so?  me thinks, he lookes like a Taylor already.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, that had said on one of his Customers suites. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>O</speaker>

of such a seruant.

                  <speaker>Q</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, I will be sworne would they:  go to Beauties, make much 
of Time, and Place, and Occasion, and Opportunity, and Fauorites, 
and things that belong to them; for I will ensure you, they will all 
relinquish; they cannot endure above another yeere; I know it 
out of future experience, and therefore take exhibition, and 
warning:  I was once a Reueller myself, and though I speake 
it (as mine owne Trumpet) I was then esteemd —

such attendants as she shall think meete for her turne; and 
therefore there is more respect requirable, how soeuer you 
seeme to conniue: Hearke you Sir, let me discourse a sillable 
with you.  I am to say to you, these Ladyes are not of that close,

your long die-Note did arride me most, but it was somwhat 
too long:  I can shew one, almost of the same nature, but

                  <p>Yes there is the Note; and all the parts if I mis-thinke 
not.  I will reade the Ditty to your Beauties here, but first I am 
to make you familiar with the occasion, which presents itself 
thus.  upon a time, going to take my leaue of the Emperour, 
and kisse his great handes; there being then present, the 
Kings of Fraunce, and Arragon, the Dukes of Sauoy, Florence, 
Orleance, Bourbon, Brunswick, the Lantgraue, Count Palatine, all 
which had seuerally feasted me; besides infinite more of inferiour 
persons, as Earles, and others:  it was my chance (the Emperour 
detain'd by some other affayre) to waite him the fifth 
part of an houre, or much near it.  In which time (retiring myself 
into a Bay-window) I encountred the Lady Annabel neice 
to the Empresse, and sister to the king of Arragon; who (hauing 
neuer before eyde me, but only heard the common report of 
my Vertue, Learning, and Trauaile) fell into that extremity of 
passion, for my loue, that she there immediatly sounded:  Phisitians 
were sent for; she had to her chamber; so to her bed; where 
(languishing some few daies) after many times calling upon 
me, with my name in her mouth, she expirde.  As that (I must 
needes say) is the only fault of my Fortune, that as it hath euer 
been my hap to be sew'd to by all Ladies, and Beauties where 
I have come, so, I neuer yet soiourn'd, or rested in that place, 
or part of the world, where some great and admirable faire 
Creature died not for my loue.

gaue me, and I reciprocally (out of the same bounty) gaue it to

gift of the deceasde Lady, upon which I compos'd this Ode,

get him to argue with me, but once, and then because I could 
not construe, a peece of Horace at first sighte, he went awaye

One (at least) studious, of deseruing well: 
And (to speake truth) indeed deseruing well, 
Potentiall merit stands for actuall, 
Where only Opportunity doth want, 
Not Will, nor Power:  both which in him abound, 
One whom the Muses, and Minerua loue; 
For whom should they more loue then Criticus, 
Whom Pho ebus (though not Fortune) holdeth deare? 
And (which conuinceth excellence in him,) 
A principall admirer of yourself: 
Even, through the vngentle iniuries of Fate, 
And difficulties, which do vertue choake, 
Thus much of him appeares.  What other things 
Of farther note, do lye vnborne in him, 
Them I do leaue for cherishment to shew. 
And for a Goddesse graciously to iudge.

                  <p>Cleare Pearle of Heauen, and not to be farther ambitious in 
titles Cynthia.  The fame of this illustrious night, among others 
hath also drawne these foure faire Virgins from the Pallace of their 
Queene Perfection (a word, which makes no sufficient difference, 
twixt hers, and thine) to visit thy Imperiall Court:  for she their Soueraigne 
Lady, not finding where to dwel among men, before her returne 
to heauen:  aduised them wholy to consecrate themselves to thy Co elestiall 
seruice, as in whose cleare Spirit (the proper Element, and Sphare 
of vertues) they should behould not her alone, (their euer honor'd 
Mistresse) but themselves (more truely themselves) to liue enthronised. 
Herself would have commended them vnto thy fauour 
more particularly, but that she knowes no commendation is more auailable 
with thee then that of proper vertue:  Neuerthelesse, she wilde 
them to present this Christall Mound, a note of Monarchy, and 
Symbole of Perfection, to thy more worthy Deity; which as here by 
me they most humbly do, so amongst the Rarities thereof, that is the 
chiefe, to shew whatsoeuer the world hath excellent, howsoeuer remote 
and various.  But your irradiate iudgement will soone discouer 
the secrets of this little Christall world.  Themselves (to appeare 
the more plainly) because they know nothing more odious then false 
pretexts: have chosen to expresse their seuerall qualities thus in seuerall 
coulors. 
1  The first in Citron coullour is naturall Affection, which given 
us to procure our good, is sometime called Storge, and as euery one is 
neerest to himself, so this Hand-maid of Reason, allowable Selfe-loue, 
as it is without harme, so are none without it:  Her place in the Court 
of Perfection was to quicken mindes in the pursute of Honor.  her 
deuice is a Perpendicular Leuell upon a, Cube or Square.  The 
word, SE SVO MODVLO:  alluding to that true measure 
of ones self, which as euery one ought to make, so is it most conspicuous 
in thy diuine example. 
2  The second in Greene is Aglaia, delectable and pleasant Conuersation, 
whose property it is to mooue a kindly delight, and sometime 
not without laughter:  Her office to entertaine assemblies, and keepe 
societies together with fayre familliarity.  Her deuice within a Ring 
of clouds, a Heart with shine about it, the worde, CVRARVM NVBILA PELLO. 
An Allegory of Cynthias light, 
which no lesse cleares the Skie, then her fayre Mirthe the heart. 
3  The third, in discoulour'd Mantle spangled all over, is Euphantaste, 
a well conceited Wittinesse, and imployde in honouring 
the Courte with the ritches of her pure Inuention.  Her deuice upon 
a Petasus, or Mercuriall Hat, a Crescent.  The worde; SIC LAVS INGENII: 
Inferring that the praise and glory of 
Wit, doth euer increase, as doth thy growing Moone. 
4  The fourth in White is Apheleia, a Nymph as pure and simple 
as the Soule, or as an abrase Table, and is therefore called Symplicity; 
without foulds, without pleights, without coullour, without counterfeit; 
and (to speake plainely) Plainenesse itself.  Her deuice is no Deuice. 
The word under her siluer Shield:  OMNIS ABEST FVCVS, 
alluding to thy spotlesse self, who art as farre from Impurity, 
as from Mortality. 
Myself (Co elestiall Goddesse) more fit for the Court of Cynthia, 
then the Arbors of Cythere, am call'd Anteros, or Loues enemy; 
the more welcome therefore to thy Court, and the fitter to conduct 
this Quaternio, who as they are thy professed Votaries, and for that 
cause aduersaries to Loue, yet thee (perpetuall Virgin) they both 
loue, and vow to loue eternally.

                  <p>Sister of Pho ebus to whose bright Orbe we owe, that we not 
complaine of his Absence; These foure Brethren (for they are Brethren 
and sonnes of Eutaxia, a Lady knowne, and highly belou'd of your 
resplendent Deity) not able to be absent, when Cynthia held a solemnity, 
officiously insinuate themselves into thy presence:  For as there are 
foure Cardinall vertues, upon which the whole Frame of the Court 
doth mooue, so are these the foure Cardinall properties without which 
the Body of Complement mooueth not.  With those foure siluer Iauelins 
(which they beare in their hands) they support in Princes Courts the 
state of the Presence, as by office they are obliged; which though here 
they may seeme superfluous, yet for Honors sake they thus presume to 
visite thee, hauing also been imployde in the Pallace of Queene Perfection. 
And though to them, that would make themselves gratious 
to a Goddesse, Sacrifices were fitter then Presents or Impresses, yet 
they both hope thy fauor, and (in place of either) vse seuerall Symboles 
containing the titles of thy imperiall Dignity. 
1  The hithermost in the changeable blew, and greene Roabe, is 
the commendably-fashionate Gallant Eucosmos, whose Courtly Habit 
is the grace of the Presence, and delight of the surueying eye:  whom 
Ladies vnderstand by the names of Neate, and Elegant.  His Symbol 
is DIVA E VIRGINI, in which he would expresse thy Deities 
principall glory, which hath euer been Virginity. 
2  The second in the ritch Acoutrement, and Roabe of Purple 
empaled with Gold, is Eupathes; who intertaines his minde with an 
harmlesse, but not incurious variety:  All the Obiects of his sences are 
Sumptuous, himself a Gallant, that without excesse can make vse of 
superfluities:  go ritchly in Imbroyders, Iewels, (and what not?) without 
Vanity; and fare delicately without Gluttony:  and therefore (not 
without cause) is vniuersally thought to be of fine humor. His Symbole 
is DIVA E OPTIMA E.  An attribute to expresse thy 
Goodnesse in which thou so resemblest Ioue thy father. 
3.  The third in the blush-collourd Sute is Eutolmos, as duly 
respecting others, as neuer neglecting himself; commonly knowne by 
the title of Good Audacitie, to Courts and courtly assemblies, a guest 
most acceptable.  His Simbole is DIVA E VIRAGINI, To
