                  <head>Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy.</head>
                  <p>TRagedy, as it was antiently compos'd, hath been ever held the
gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems: therefore
said by <hi>Aristotle</hi> to be of power by raising pity and fear, or
terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is to
temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirr'd
up by read<g ref="#rehy"/>ing  or seeing those passions well imitated.  Nor is
Nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for so in
Physic things of melancholic hue and quality are us'd against
melancholy, sowr against sowr, salt to remove salt humours.  Hence
Philosophers and other gravest Writers, as <hi>Cicero</hi>,
<hi>Plutarch</hi> and others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both
to adorn and illustrate thir discourse. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
himself thought it not unworthy to insert a verse of <hi>Euripedes</hi>
into the Text of Holy Scripture, <bibl>I <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33.</bibl> 
and <hi>Paræus</hi> commenting on the <hi>Revelation</hi>,
divides the whole Book as a Tra<g ref="#rehy"/>gedy,  into Acts distinguisht each
by a Chorus of Heavenly Harpings and Song between.  Hereto<g ref="#rehy"/>fore
<milestone n="I2" unit="sig"/>
                     <pb n="4"/> Men in highest dignity have labour'd not a little to be
thought able to compose a Tragedy. Of that honour <hi>Dionysius</hi>
the elder was no less am<g ref="#rehy"/>bitious, then before of his attaining to the
Tyranny.  <hi>Augustus Cæsar</hi> also had begun his <hi>Ajax</hi>,
but unable to please his own judgment with what he had be<g ref="#rehy"/>gun, left
it unfinisht.  <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher is by some thought the
Author of those Tragedies (at lest the best of them) that go under
that name.  <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> a Father of the Church, thought
it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a Tragedy,
which he entitl'd, <hi>Christ suffering</hi>. This is mention'd to
vindicate Tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which in
the account of many it undergoes at this day with other com<g ref="#rehy"/>mon
Interludes; hap'ning through the Poets error of intermixing Comic
stuff with Tragic sadness and gravity; or introducing trivial and
vulgar persons, which by all judicious hath bin counted absurd; and
brought in without discretion, corruptly to gra<g ref="#rehy"/>tifie the people.
And though antient Tragedy use no Prologue, yet using sometimes, in
case of self defence, or explanation, that which <hi>Martial</hi>
calls an Epistle; in behalf of this Tragedy coming forth af<g ref="#rehy"/>ter the
antient manner, much different from what among us passes for best,
thus much before-hand may be Epistl'd; that <hi>Chorus</hi> is here
introduc'd after the Greek manner, not antient only but modern, and
still in use among the <hi>Italians</hi>.  In the modelling therefore
of this Poem, with good reason, the An<g ref="#rehy"/>tients and <hi>Italians</hi>
are rather follow'd, as of much <pb n="5"/> more authority and fame.
The measure of Verse us'd in the Chorus is of all sorts, call'd by the
Greeks <term>Monostrophic</term>, or rather <term>Apolelymenon</term>,
without regard had to <term>Strophe</term>, <term>Antistrophe</term>
or <term>Epod</term>, which were a kind of Stanza's fram'd only for
the Music, then us'd with the Chorus that sung; not essential to the
Poem, and therefore not material; or being divided into Stanza's or
Pauses, they may be call'd <term>Allæostropha</term>.  Division into
Act and Scene re<g ref="#rehy"/>ferring chiefly to the Stage (to which this work
never was intended) is here omitted.</p>
                  <p>It suffices if the whole Drama be found not pro<g ref="#rehy"/>duc't  beyond
the fift Act, of the style and unifor<g ref="#rehy"/>mitie,  and that commonly
call'd the Plot, whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed
but such œconomy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best
with verisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not
unacquainted with
<hi>Æschulus</hi>, <hi>Sophocles</hi>, and <hi>Euripedes</hi>,
the three Tra<g ref="#rehy"/>gic  Poets unequall'd yet by any, and the best rule
to all who endeavour to write Tragedy.  The cir<g ref="#rehy"/>cumscription  of
time wherein the whole Drama be<g ref="#rehy"/>gins  and ends, is according to
antient rule, and best example, within the space of 24 hours. </p>

the Lords and People, to play or shew his strength in thir presence; he
at first refuses, dismissing the publick Officer with absolute denyal to
come; at length perswaded inwardly that this was from God, he yields to
go along with him, who came now the second time with great threatnings
