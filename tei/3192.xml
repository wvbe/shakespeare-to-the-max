               <l>Are coming to attend their Fathers state, </l>
               <l>And new-entrusted Scepter, but their way </l>
               <l>Lies through the perplex't paths of this drear Wood, </l>

               <l>What never yet was heard in Tale or Song </l>
               <l>From old, or modern Bard in Hall, or Bowr. </l>

               <l>The daughter of the Sun? Whose charmed Cup </l>
               <l>Whoever tasted, lost his upright shape, </l>
               <l>And downward fell into a groveling Swine) </l>

               <l>With Ivy berries wreath' d, and his blithe youth, </l>
               <l>Had by him, ere he parted thence, a Son </l>
               <l>Much like his Father, but his Mother more, </l>
               <l>Whom therfore she brought up and Comus nam'd, </l>
               <l>Who ripe, and frolick of his full grown age, </l>
               <l>Roaving the <hi>Celtick</hi>, and <hi>Iberian</hi> fields, </l>
               <l>At last betakes him to this ominous Wood, </l>
               <l>And in thick shelter of black shades imbowr'd, </l>
               <l>Excells his Mother at her mighty Art, </l>
               <l>Offring to every weary Travailer, </l>
               <l>His orient liquor in a Crystal Glasse, </l>
               <l>To quench the drouth of <hi>Phoebus</hi>, which as they taste </l>
               <l>(For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst) </l>
               <l>Soon as the Potion works, their human count'nance, </l>
               <l>Th' express resemblance of the gods, is chang'd </l>
               <l>Into som brutish form of Woolf, or Bear, </l>
               <l>Or Ounce, or Tiger, Hog, or bearded Goat, </l>
               <l>All other parts remaining as they were, </l>
               <l>And they, so perfect is their misery, </l>
               <l>Not once perceive their foul disfigurement, </l>
               <l>But boast themselves more comely then before </l>
               <l>And all their friends, and native home forget </l>
               <l>To roule with pleasure in a sensual stie. </l>
               <l>Therfore when any favour'd of high <hi>Jove</hi>, </l>
               <l>Chances to pass through this adventrous glade, </l>
               <l>Swift as the Sparkle of a glancing Star, </l>

               <l>And take the Weeds and likenes of a Swain, </l>
               <l>That to the service of this house belongs, </l>
               <l>Who with his soft Pipe, and smooth-dittied Song, </l>
               <l>Well knows to still the wilde winds when they roar, </l>
               <l>And hush the waving Woods, nor of lesse faith, </l>

               <l>In wanton dance they praise the bounteous <hi>Pan</hi>, </l>
               <l>And thank the gods amiss. I should be loath </l>

               <l>Of such late Wassailers; yet O where els </l>
               <l>Shall I inform my unacquainted feet </l>
               <l>In the blind mazes of this tangl'd Wood? </l>
               <l>My Brothers when they saw me wearied out </l>
               <l>With this long way, resolving here to lodge </l>
               <l>Under the spreading favour of these Pines, </l>
               <l>Stept as they se'd to the next Thicket side </l>
               <l>To bring me Berries, or such cooling fruit </l>
               <l>As the kind hospitable Woods provide. </l>
               <l>They left me then, when the gray-hooded Eev'n </l>
               <l>Like a sad Votarist in Palmers weed </l>
               <l>Rose from the hindmost wheels of <hi>Phoebus</hi> wain. </l>
               <l>But where they are, and why they came not back, </l>
               <l>Is now the labour of my thoughts, 'tis likeliest </l>
               <l>They had ingag'd their wandring steps too far, </l>
               <l>And envious darknes, e're they could return, </l>
               <l>Had stole them from me, els O theevish Night </l>
               <l>Why shouldst thou, but for som fellonious end, </l>
               <l>In thy dark lantern thus close up the Stars, </l>
               <l>That nature hung in Heav'n, and fill'd their Lamps </l>
               <l>With everlasting to give due light </l>
               <l>To the misled and lonely Travailer? </l>
               <l>This is the place, as well as I may guess, </l>
               <l>Whence eev'n now the tumult of loud Mirth </l>

               <l>Yet nought but single darknes do I find. </l>
               <l>What might this be? A thousand fantasies </l>

               <l>Of calling shapes, and beckning shadows dire, </l>
               <l>And airy tongues, that syllable mens names </l>
               <l>On Sands, and Shoars, and desert Wildernesses. </l>
               <l>These thoughts may startle well, but not astound </l>
               <l>The vertuous mind, that ever walks attended </l>

               <l>And thou unblemish't form of Chastity, </l>
               <l>I see ye visibly, and now beleeve </l>

               <l>Was I deceiv'd, or did a sable cloud </l>
               <l>Turn forth her silver lining on the night? </l>
               <l>I did not err, there does a sable cloud </l>
               <l>Turn forth her silver lining on the night </l>
               <l>And casts a gleam over this tufted Grove. </l>
               <l>I cannot hallow to my Brothers, but </l>

               <l>And run to meet what he would most avoid? </l>
               <l>Or if they be but false alarms of Fear, </l>

               <l>And the sweet peace that goodnes boosoms ever, </l>
               <l>As that the single want of light and noise </l>
               <l>(Not being in danger, as I trust she is not) </l>
               <l>Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts, </l>

               <l>And fill'd the Air with barbarous dissonance, </l>

               <l>Where day never shuts his eye, </l>
               <l>Up in the broad fields of the sky: </l>
               <l>There I suck the liquid ayr </l>
               <l>All amidst the Gardens fair </l>
               <l>Of <hi>Hesperus</hi>, and his daughters three </l>
               <l>That sing about the golden tree: </l>
               <l>Along the crisped shades and bowres </l>
               <l>Revels the spruce and jocond Spring, </l>
               <l>The Graces, and the rosie-boosom'd Howres, </l>
               <l>Thither all their bounties bring, </l>
               <l>That there eternal Summer dwels, </l>
               <l>And West winds, with musky wing </l>
               <l>About the cedar'n alleys fling </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nard</hi>, and <hi>Cassia's</hi> balmy smels. </l>

               <l>(List mortals, if your ears be true) </l>
               <l>Beds of Hyacinth, and roses </l>
               <l>Where young <hi>Adonis</hi> oft reposes, </l>
               <l>Waxing well of his deep wound </l>
               <l>In slumber soft, and on the ground </l>
               <l>Sadly sits th' <hi>Assyrian</hi> Queen; </l>
               <l>But far above in spangled sheen </l>
               <l>Celestial <hi>Cupid</hi> her fam'd son advanc't, </l>
               <l>Holds his dear <hi>Psyche</hi> sweet intranc't </l>
               <l>After her wandring labours long, </l>
               <l>Till free consent the gods among </l>
               <l>Make her his eternal Bride, </l>
               <l>And from her fair unspotted side </l>
               <l>Two blissful twins are to be born, </l>
               <l>Youth and Joy; so <hi>Jove</hi> hath sworn. </l>
               <l>  But now my task is smoothly don, </l>
               <l>I can fly, or I can run </l>
               <l>Quickly to the green earths end, </l>
               <l>Where the bow'd welkin slow doth bend, </l>
               <l>And from thence can soar as soon </l>
               <l>To the corners of the Moon. </l>
               <l>  Mortals that would follow me, </l>
               <l>Love vertue, she alone is free, </l>
               <l>She can teach ye how to clime </l>
               <l>Higher then the Spheary chime; </l>
               <l>Or if Vertue feeble were, </l>
               <l>Heav'n it self would stoop to her. </l>
