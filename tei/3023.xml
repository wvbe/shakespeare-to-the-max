            <head rend="roman">THE VERSE</head>
            <p>THE Measure is <hi>English</hi> Heroic Verse without
            Rime, as that of <hi>Homer</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> and of
            <hi>Virgil</hi> in <hi>Latin;</hi> Rime being no necessary
            Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer
            Works especially, but the Invention of a bar<g ref="#rehy"/>barous Age, to set off wretched matter and
            lame Meeter; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous
            modern Poets, carri<g ref="#rehy"/> ed away by Custom, but
            much to thir own vexation, hindrance, and constraint to
            ex<g ref="#rehy"/>press many things otherwise, and for the
            most part worse then else they would have exprest them.
            Not without cause therefore some both <hi>Italian</hi> and
            <hi>Spanish</hi> Poets of prime note have rejected Rime
            both in longer and shorter Works, as have also long since
            our best <hi>English</hi> Trage<g ref="#rehy"/>dies, as a
            thing of it self, to all judicious ears, triveal and of no
            true musical delight; which consists onely in apt Numbers,
            fit quantity of Syllables, and the sense variously drawn
            out from one Verse into another, not in the jingling sound
            of like endings, a fault avoyded by <pb/> the learned
            Ancients both in Poetry and all good Oratory.  This
            neglect then of Rime so little is to be taken for a
            defect, though it may seem so perhaps to vulgar Readers,
            that it ra<g ref="#rehy"/>ther is to be esteem'd an
            example set, the first in <hi>English,</hi> of ancient
            liberty recover'd to He<g ref="#rehy"/>roic Poem from the
            troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.</p>

            <head rend="roman">THE ARGUMENT.</head>
            <p>This first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole Subject, 
<hi>Mans disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein  he
was plac't:</hi> Then touches <hi>the prime cause of his fall,  the
Serpent, or rather <hi>Satan</hi> in the Serpent; who revolting from 
God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels, was by the  command
of God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the  great Deep.</hi>
 Which action past over, the Poem hasts into the  midst of things,
presenting <hi>Satan</hi> 
               <hi> with his Angels now  fallen into Hell,</hi>
describ'd here, <hi>not in the Center</hi>  (for Hea<g ref="#rehy"/>ven and Earth
may be suppos'd as yet not made,  certainly not yet accurst) <hi>but in
a place of utter darkness,  fitliest call'd  <hi>Chaos</hi>: Here <hi>Satan</hi>
with his Angels  lying onthe burning Lake, thunder-struck and astonisht,
after a certain  space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who
next in Order  and Dignity lay by him; they confer of thir mi<g ref="#rehy"/>serable
fall. 
<hi>Satan</hi> awakens all his Legions, who <pb n="2"/> lay till then
in the same manner confounded; They rise, thir Numbers,  array of
Battel, thir chief Leaders nam'd, according to the Idols  known af<g ref="#rehy"/>terwards
in <hi>Canaan</hi> and the Countries adjoyning. To  these <hi>Satan</hi>directs
his Speech, comforts them with hope yet of  regaining Heaven, but tells
them lastly of a new World and new  kind of Creature to be created,
according to an ancient Prophesie  or report in Heaven</hi>; for that

            <p>God sitting on his Throne sees <hi>Satan</hi> flying towards this
world,  then newly created; shews him to the Son who sat at his right 
hand; foretells the success of <hi>Satan</hi> in perverting mankind; 
clears his own Justice and Wisdom from all imputation, having  created
Man free and able enough to have withstood his  Temp<g ref="#rehy"/>ter; yet
declares his purpose of grace towards him, in  regard he fell not of his
own malice; as did <hi>Satan</hi>, but by him  seduc't.  The Son of God
renders praises to his Father for the  manifestation of his gracious pur<g ref="#rehy"/>pose
towards Man; but God  again declares, that Grace cannot be extended
towards Man without  the satisfaction of divine Justice; Man hath
offended the majesty  of God by aspiring to God-head, and there<g ref="#rehy"/>fore
with all his  Progeny devoted to death must dye, unless some one can be
found  sufficient to answer for his offence, and undergo his Punishment.
  The Son of God freely offers himself a Ransome for Man: the <pb n="61"/>
 Father accepts him, ordains his incarnation,  pronoun<g ref="#rehy"/>ces
his exaltation above all Names in Heaven and  Earth; commands all the
Angels to adore him; they obey, and  hymning to thir Harps in full
Quire, celebrate the Father and the  Son.  Mean while  <hi>Sa<g ref="#rehy"/>tan</hi>
alights upon the bare Convex of  this Worlds outer<g ref="#rehy"/>most Orb; where
wandring he first finds a  place since call'd The Lymbo of Vanity; what
persons and things  fly up thither; thence comes to the Gate of Heaven,
describ'd  ascending by staires, and the wa<g ref="#rehy"/>ters above the Firmament
 that flow about it: His passage thence to the Orb of the Sun; he  finds
there <hi>Uriel</hi> the Regient of that Orb, but first changes 
himself into the shape of a meaner Angel; and pre<g ref="#rehy"/>tending a  zealous
desire to behold the new Creation and Man whom God had  plac't here,
inquires of him the place of his habitation, and is  directed; alights
first on <name>Mount</name>

Engines, which in the  second dayes Fight put <hi>Michael</hi> and his
Angels to some disorder;   but they at length pulling up Mountains
overwhelm'd both the  force and Machins of <hi>Satan</hi>: Yet the
Tumult not so ending, God  on the third day sends <hi>Messiah</hi> his
Son, for whom he had  reserv'd the glory of that Victory: Hee in the
Power of his  Father coming to the place, and causing all his Legions to
stand  still on either side, with his Chariot and Thunder driving into 
the midst of his Enemies, pursues them unable to resist towards  the
wall of Heaven;  which opening, they leap down with horrour  and
confusion into the place of punishment prepar'd for them in  the Deep:
<hi>Messiah</hi> returns with triumph to his Father.</p>

<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the Morning go forth to thir
labours, which 
<hi>Eve</hi> proposes to divide in several places, each labouring
apart: 
<hi>Adam</hi> con<g ref="#rehy"/>sents not, alledging the danger, lest that Enemy,
 of whom they were forewarn'd, should attempt her found alone:  
<hi>Eve</hi> loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough, urges 
her going apart, the rather desi<g ref="#rehy"/>rous to make tryal of her 
strength; <hi>Adam</hi> at last yields: The Serpent finds her alone;
his  subtle ap<g ref="#rehy"/>roach, first gazing, then speaking, with much  flat<g ref="#rehy"/>tery
extolling <hi>Eve</hi> above all other Creatures. <hi>Eve</hi> 
wondring to hear the Serpent speak, asks how he at<g ref="#rehy"/>tain'd to  human
speech and such understanding not till now; the Serpent  answers, that
by tasting of a certain Tree in the Garden he  attain'd both to Speech
and Reason, till then void of each;  
<hi>Eve</hi> requires him <pb n="214"/> to bring her to that  Tree, and
finds it to be the Tree of Knowledge forbidden: The  Serpent now grow
bolder, with many wiles and arguments induces  her at length to eat; she
pleas'd with the taste deliberates a  while whether to impart thereof to
<hi>Adam</hi> or not, at last brings  him of the Fruit, relates what
perswaded her to eat thereof: 
<hi>Adam</hi> at first amaz'd, but per<g ref="#rehy"/>ceiving her lost, resolves 
through vehemence of love to perish with her; and extenuating the 
trespass eats also of the Fruit: The Effects thereof in them  both; they
seek to cover thir nakedness; then fall to  vari<g ref="#rehy"/>ance and accusation

in pity cloaths them both, and reascends. <hi>Sin</hi>  and <hi>Death</hi>
sitting till then at the Gates of Hell, by wondrous  sym<g ref="#rehy"/>pathie
feeling the success of <hi>Satan</hi> in this new World,  and the sin
by Man there committed, resolve to sit no longer  confin'd in Hell, but
to follow <hi>Satan</hi> thir Sire up to the place  of Man: To make the
way easier from Hell to this World to and  fro, they pave a broad High<g ref="#rehy"/>way

chew dust and bitter ashes.  The  proceedings of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi>
God foretels the final Victory  of his Son over them, and the renewing
of all things; but for the  present commands his Angels to make several
altera<g ref="#rehy"/>tions in  the Heavens and Elements. <hi>Adam</hi> more and
more perceiving his  fall'n condition heavily bewailes, rejects the
consolement of 
<hi>Eve;</hi> she persists and at length appeases him: then to evade
the  Curse likely to fall on thir Ofspring, proposes to <hi>Adam</hi>
violent  wayes which he approves not, but conceiving better hope, puts
her  in mind of the late Promise made them, that her Seed should be 
reveng'd on the Serpent, and exhorts her with him to seek Peace  of the
offended Deity, by repentance and supplication.</p>
