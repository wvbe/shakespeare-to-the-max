            <note>
               <p>This text is created direct from the earliest printed
	     text — the small, cheap books in quarto format sold by
	     the booksellers of St Paul's Churchyard for around
	     sixpence. It has not been edited, and so you can
	     experience the idiosyncrasies of early modern print. In
	     an age when spelling was not standardised, a range of
	     ways of spelling even quite simple words was usual. Often
	     homophones — words such as <q>to</q> and
	     <q>too</q> which sound the same but are distinguished in
	     modern spelling — are not clear, and this is one
	     of the great sources of puns for early modern
	     writers. Speech prefixes and stage directions are also
	     not presented in the form readers of modern playtexts are
	     used to, and nor did these early texts include a list of
	     characters or an index of acts and scenes. Some features
	     of early modern printing may also be unfamiliar —
	     the interchangeability of the letters <q>u</q> and
	     <q>v</q>, for example, or <q>i</q> and <q>y</q>. There
	     was no letter <q>j</q> in the sets of type used by
	     printers, so that letter is signalled with the letter
	     <q>i</q> or <q>I</q>. </p>
               <p>To find out more about
	     early modern print and how and why plays were printed see
	     the Furness Collection, University of Pennsylvania's
	     multimedia online tutorials at <ptr target="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/sceti/furness/eric/teach/index.cfm"/>

Men (who neuer saw the<lb/>

fame arriued at my knowledge, receiuing it from some<lb/>
of worth, who both in contemplation, and practise, <lb/>
owe to your Honour their clearest service. I do not<lb/>
altogether look up at your title: The ancien'st<lb/>
Nobility, being but a rellique of time past, and the<lb/>
truest Honor indeede being for a man to conferre<lb/>
Honor on himself, which your Learning stiues to<lb/>
Propagate, and shall make you arrive at the Dignity<lb/>
of a great Example. I am confident this worke is<lb/>
no unworthy your Honors perusal for by such <lb/>
Poems as this, Poets haue kist the hands of Great<lb/>
Princes, and drawne their gentle eyes to looke downe<lb/>
upon their sheets of paper, when the Poets them<lb type="hyphenInWord"/>selves <lb/>
were bound up in their wining-sheets. The<lb/>
like curtesie from your Lordship, shall make you liue<lb/>
in your graue, and laurell spring out of it when the <lb/>
ignorant scorners of the Muses (that like a wormes in<lb/>
Libraries, seem to liue only, to destroy learning)<lb/>
shall wither, neglected, and forgotten. This worke <lb/>
and my selfe I humbly present to your approued<lb/>
censure. It being the utmost of my wishes, to have your <lb/>
