               <l>"Of pleaſure and fun I will ſtill have my fill;</l>

               <l>"'Rejoice, O young man, in the days of thy youth'—</l>
               <l>"I am glad" (anſwer'd Bob) "you're of Solomon's creed,</l>
               <l>"But I beg if you quote him you'll pleaſe to proceed;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"For God" (as the wiſe man continues to ſing)</l>
               <l>"Thy ſoul into Judgment for all this will bring.</l>
               <l>"Thus a man may get plung'd in a woeful abyſs,</l>
               <l>"By chuſing to ſay, <hi>Pray what harm is in this?</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Come, Come" (ſays gay Richard) "don't grudge me a "Cup;</l>
               <l>I'm reſolv'd, while I'm able, I'll ſtill keep it up;</l>
               <l>"Let old Greybeards deny that in frolic's there's bliſs;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Says Robert, "I grant if you live for to-day,</l>
               <l>"You may game, love, and drink, and may frolic away;</l>
               <l>"But then, my dear Dick, I again muſt contend,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Says Richard, "when ſickneſs or peeviſh old age,</l>
               <l>"Shall advance to diſmiſs me from life's merry ſtage;</l>
               <l>"Repentance juſt then, Boy, may not be amiſs,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>They parted—and Richard his paſtimes begun,</l>
               <l>'Twas Richard the Jovial, the ſoul of all fun;</l>
               <l>Each dancing bout, drinking bout, Dick would attend,</l>
               <l>And he ſung and he ſwore—<hi>nor once thought of the End.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Young Molly he courted, the pride of the plain,</l>
               <l>He promis'd her marriage, but promis'd in vain;</l>
               <l>She truſted his vows, but ſhe ſoon was undone,</l>
               <l>And when ſhe fell weeping he thought it good fun.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus ſcorn'd by her Richard ſad Molly run wild,</l>
               <l>And roam'd thro' the woods with her deſtitute child;</l>
               <l>'Till poor Molly and Molly's poor Baby were found</l>
               <l>One evening in Richard's own mill pond both drown'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then his conſcience grew troubl'd by night and by day,</l>
               <l>But it's clamour he drown'd in more drink and more play;</l>
               <l>Still Robert exhorted, and like a true friend,</l>
               <l>He warn'd him he pray'd him—<hi>to think on the End.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now diſturb'd in his dreams poor Molly each night</l>
               <l>With her babe ſtood before him; how ſad was the ſight!</l>
               <l>O how ghaſtly ſhe look'd as ſhe bade him attend,</l>
               <l>And ſo awfully told him—<hi>"Remember the End."</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She talk'd of the woes and unquenchable fire</l>
               <l>Which await the gay Sinner, the Drunkard, and Liar;</l>
               <l>How he ruin'd more maidens ſhe bade him beware,</l>
               <l>Then ſhe wept, and ſhe groan'd, and ſhe vaniſh'd in air.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now beggar'd by Gaming, diſtemper'd by Drink,</l>
               <l>Death ſtar'd in his face, yet he dar'd not to think;</l>
               <l>Deſpairing of mercy, deſpiſing all truth,</l>
               <l>He dy'd of old age in the prime of his youth.</l>
