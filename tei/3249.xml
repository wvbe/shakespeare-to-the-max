                  <p>Gentlemen, have a little patience, they are 
e'en upon comming, instantly.  He that 
should beginne the Play, Master Littlewit, 
the Proctor, has a stitch new falne, in his 
black silk stocking; it will be drawn up ere 
you can tell twenty.  He playes one of the Arches, that dwels 
about the Hospitall, and he has a very pretty part.  But for 
the whole Play, will you have the truth of it?  (I am looking, 
lest the Poet heare me, or his man, Master Broome, behind 
the Arras) it is like to be a very conceited scuruy one, in 
plaine English.  When it comes to the Fayre, once:  you 
Were e'en as good go to Virginia, for any thing there is of 
Smith-field.  He has not hit the humors, he does not know 
them; he has not conuers'd with the Bartholomew-birds, 
as they say; he has ne'er a Sword, and Buckler man in 
his Fayre, nor a little Dauy, to take toll of the Bawds there, 
as in my time, nor a Kind-heart, if any bodies teeth should 
chance to ake in his Play.  Nor a Iugler with a wel-educated 
Ape to come ouer the chaine, for the King of England, 
and backe againe for the Prince, and sit still on his arse for 
the Pope; and the King of Spaine!  None of these fine sights! 
Nor has he the Canuas-cut in the night, for a Hobby-horseman 
to creepe into his she-neighbour, and take his leap, 
there!  Nothing!  No, if some writer (that I know) had 
had but the penning of this matter, he would have made 
you such a Iig-ajogge in the boothes, you should have thought 
an earthquake had been in the Fayre!  But these Master-Poets, 
they will have their owne absurd courses; they will 
be inform'd of nothing!  He has (sirreuerence) kick'd me 
three, or foure times about the Tyring-house, I thanke 
him, for but offering to putt in, with my experience.  I will 
be iudg'd by you, Gentlemen, now, but for one conceit of 
mine!  would not a fine Pumpe upon the Stage have done 
well, for a property now?  and a Punque set vnder upon 
her head, with her Sterne upward, and have beene sous'd 
by my wity young masters of the Innes of Court?  what 
thinke you of this for a shew, now?  he will not heare 
of this!  I am an Asse!  I!  and yet I kept the Stage in Master Tarletons 
time, I thanke my starres.  Ho!  if that man 
had liu'd to have play'd in Bartholomew Fayre, you should 
have seene him have come in, and have been coozened in the 
Cloath-quarter, so finely!  And Adams, the Rogue, ha 
leap'd and caper'd upon him, and have dealt his vermine 
about, as though they had cost him nothing.  And then 
a substantiall watch to have stolne in upon them, and taken 
them away, with mistaking words, as the fashion is, in 
the Stage-practice.

                  <speaker>W</speaker>
                  <p>How now?  what rare discourse are you falne 
upon?  ha?  have you found any familiars here, that you 
are so free?  what is the businesse? 
Nothing, but the vnderstanding Gentlemen of 
the ground here, ask'd my iudgement. 
Your iudgement, Rascall?  for what?  sweeping 
the Stage?  or gathering up the broken Apples for the beares 
within?  Away Rogue, it is come to a fine degree in these 
spectacles when such a youth as you pretend to a iudgement. 
And yet he may, in the most of this matter i'faith: 
For the Author hath writ it iust to his Meridian, and the 
Scale of the grounded Iudgements here, his Play-fellowes 
in wit.  Gentlemen; not for want of a Prologue, but by 
way of a new one, I am sent out to you here, with a Scriuener, 
and certaine Articles drawne out in hast betweene 
our Author, and you; which if you please to heare, and as 
they appeare reasonable, to approue of; the Play will follow 
presently.  Read, Scribe, give me the Counterpaine. 
ARTICLES of Agreement, intended, between the 
Spectators or Hearers, at the Hope on the Bankeside, in 
the County of Surrey on the one party; And the Author of 
Bartholomew Fayre in the said place, and County on the other 
party:  the one and thirtieth day of O<hi rend="sup">ctob</hi> 1614 and in 
the twelfth yeere of the Raigne of our Soueragine Lord, 
IAMES by the grace of God King of England, France, and Ireland; 
Defender of the faith.  And of Scotland the seauen 
and fortieth. 
</p>
                  <p>INPRIMIS, It is couenanted and agreed, by and betweene 
the parties abouesaid, and the said Spectators, and 
Hearers, as well the curious and enuious, as the sauouring 
and iudicious, as also the grounded Iudgements and vnderstandings, 
do for themselues seuerally Couenant, and 
agree to remaine in the places, their money or friends have 
put them in, with patience, for the space of two houres 
and a halfe, and somewhat more.  In which time the 
Author promiseth to present them by us, with a new sufficient 
Play called BARTHOLOMEW FAYRE, merry, and 
as full of noise, as sport:  made to delight all, and to offend 
none.  Prouided they have either, the wit or the honesty 
to thinke well of themselues. 
</p>
                  <p>It is further agreed that euery person here, have his or 
their free-will of censure, to like or dislike at their owne 
charge, the Author hauing now departed with his right: 
It shall be lawfull for any man to iudge his six pen'orth 
his twelue pen'orth, so to his eighteene pence, 2. shillings, 
halfe a crowne, to the value of his place:  Prouided alwaies 
his place get not aboue his wit.  And if he pay for halfe a dozen, 
he may censure for all them too, so that he will 
vndertake that they shall be silent.  He shall put in for 
Censures here, as they do for lots at the lottery:  mary if he 
drop but sixe pence at the doore, and will censure a 
crownes worth, it is thought there is no conscience, or 
iustice in that. 
</p>
                  <p>It is also agreed, that euery man here, exercise his 
owne Iudgement, and not censure by Contagion, or upon 
trust, from anothers voice, or face, that sits by him, 
be he neuer so first, in the Commission of Wit:  As also, 
that he be fixt and settled in his censure, that what 
he approues, or not approues to day, he will do 
the same to morrow, and if to morrow, the next day, 
and so the next weeke (if neede be:)  and not to be 
brought about by any that sits on the Bench with him, 
though they indite, and arraigne Playes daily.  He 
that will sweare, Ieronimo, or Andronicus are the best 
playes, yet, shall passe vnexcepted at, here, as a man 
whose Iudgement shewes it is constant, and hath stood 
still, these fiue and twentie, or thirtie yeeres.  Though it 
be an Ignorance, it is a vertuous and stay'd ignorance; 
and next to truth, a confirm'd errour does well; such 
a one the Author knowes where to finde him. 
</p>
                  <p>It is further couenanted, concluded and agreed, that 
how great soeuer the expectation be, no person here, 
is to expect more then he knowes, or better ware 
then a Fayre will affoord:  neyther to looke backe to 
the sword and buckler-age of Smithfield, but content 
himselfe with the present. In stead of a little Dauy; to 
take toll of the Bawds, the Author doth promise a strutting 
Horse-courser, with a leere-Drunkard, two or three 
to attend him, in as good Equipage as you would wish. 
And then for Kinde-heart, the Tooth-drawer, a fine oyly 
Pig-woman with her Tapster, to bid you welcome, and 
a consort of Roarers for musique.  A wise Iustice of Peace 
meditant, in stead of a Iugler, with an Ape.  A 
ciuill Cutpurse searchant.  A sweete Singer of new Ballads 
allurant:  and as fresh as Hypocrite, as euer was 
broach'd rampant.  If there be neuer a Seruant-monster 
in the Fayre, who can helpe it?  he sayes; nor a nest of 
Antiques?  He is loth to make Nature afraid in his 
Playes, like those that beget Tales, Tempests, and such like 
Drolleries, to mixe his head with other mens heeles; let 
the concupisence of Iigges and Dances, raigne as strong 
as it will amongst you:  yet if the Puppets will please 
any body, they shall be entreated to come in. 
</p>
                  <p>In consideration of which, it is finally agreed, by the foresaid 
hearers, and spectators, that they neyther in themselues 
conceale, nor suffer by them to be concealed any State-decipherer, 
or politique Picklocke of the Scene, so solemnly 
ridiculous, as to search out, who was meant by the 
Ginger-bread-woman, who by the Hobby-horse-man, who 
by the Costard-monger, nay, who by their Wares.  Or that 
will pretend to affirme (on his owne inspired ignorance) 
what Mirror of Magistrates is meant by the Iustice, 
what great Lady by the Pigge-woman, what conceal'd States-man, 
by the Seller of Mouse-trappes, and so 
of the rest.  But that such person, or persons so found, 
be left discouered to the mercy of the Author, as a forfeiture 
to the Stage, and your laughter, aforesaid.  As also, 
such as shall so desperately, or ambitiously, play 
the foole by his place aforesaid, to challenge the Author 
of scurrilitie, because the language some where 
fauours of Smithfield, the Booth, and the Pig-broath, 
or of prophanenesse, because a Mad-man cryes, God 
quit you, or blesse you.  In witnesse whereof, as you have 
preposterously put to your Seales already (which is 
your money) you will now adde the other part of 
suffrage, your hands, The Play shall presently begin. 
And though the Fayre be not kept in the same Region, 
that some here, perhaps, would have it, yet thinke; 
that therein the Author hath obseru'd a speciall Decorum, 
the place being as durty as Smithfield, and as stinking 
euery whit. 
</p>
                  <p>Howsoeuer, he prayes you to beleeue, this Ware is still 
the same, else you will make him iustly suspect that 
he that is so loth to looke on a Baby, or an Hobby-horse, 
here, would be glad to take up a Commodity of them, at any laughter, 
or losse, in another place.

                  <p>A pretty conceit, and worth the finding!  I have 
such lucke to spinne out these fine things still, 
and like a Silke-worme, out of my selfe.  Here is 
Master Bartholomew Cokes, of Harrow o'th hill, 
in the County of Middlesex, Esquire, takes forth 
his Licence, to marry Mistress Grace Wel-borne 
of the said place and County:  and when does 
he take it foorth?  to day!  the foure and twentieth of August! 
Bartholmew day!  Bartholmew upon Bartholmew!  there is the deuice! 
who would have mark'd such a leap-frogge chance now?  A 
very lesse then Ames-ace, on two Dice!  well, go thy wayes Iohn Little-wit, 
Proctor Iohn Little-wit:  One of the pretty wits of Pauls, 
the Little wit of London (so thou art call'd) and some thing beside. 
When a quirk, or a quiblin does scape thee, and thou dost not watch, 
and apprehend it, and bring it afore the Constable of conceit: 
(there now, I speake quib too) let them carry thee out of the Arch-deacons 
Court, into his Kitchin, and make a Iack of thee, in stead 
of a Iohn.  (There I am againe la!)  Win, Good morrow, Win.  I 
marry Win!  Now you looke finely indeed, Win!  this Cap does 
conuince!  you would not have worne it, Win, not have had it veluet, but 
a rough countrey Beauer, with a copper-band, like the Conney-skinne 
woman of Budge-row?  Sweete Win, let me kisse it!  And. 
her fine high shooes, like the Spanish Lady!  Good Win, go a litle 
I would faine see thee pace, pretty Win!  By this fine Cap, I could 
neuer leaue kissing of it.

and wife make one foole, Win.  (Good!)  Is there the Proctor, or 
Doctor indeed, in the Diocesse, that euer had the fortune to win him 
such a Win!  (There I am againe!)  I do feele conceits comming 
upon me, more then I am able to turne tongue to.  A poxe on 
these pretenders, to wit!  your Three Cranes, Miter, and Mermaid 
men!  Not a corne of true salt, nor a graine of right mustard 
amongst them all.  They may stand for places or so, againe the next 
Wit fall, and pay two pence in a quart more for their Canary, then 
other men.  But give me the man, can start up a Iustice of Wit out of 
six-shillings beare, and give the law to all the Poets, and Poet-suckers 
in the Towne, because they are the Players Gossips?  'Slid, other 
men have wiues as fine as the Players, and as well drest.  Come 
hither, Win.

                  <p>But my taste, Master Little-wit, tends to fruict of a 
later kinde:  the sober Matron, your wiues mother.

                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>Aye!  we know you are a Suitor, Sir.  Win, and I both, wish 
you well:  by this Licence here, would you had her, that your two 
names were as fast in it, as here are a couple.  Win would faine 
have a fine young father i' law, with a fether:  that her mother 
might hood it, and chaine it, with Mistris Ouer-doo.  But, you do 
not take the right course, Master Win-wife.

                  <p>Sir, my mother has had her natiuity-water cast lately 
by the Cunning men in Cow lane, and they have told her her fortune, 
and do ensure her, she shall neuer have happy houre; vnlesse 
she marry within this sen'night, and when it is, it must be 
a Madde-man, they say.

                  <speaker>A</speaker>

                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, and has beene at Bedlem twice since, euery day, to

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>E</speaker>
                  <p>Why, this is a confederacy, a meere piece of practice 
upon her, by these Impostors?

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>I tell her so; or else say I, that they meane some young, 
Madcap-Gentleman (for the diuell can equiuocate, as well as a 
Shop-keeper) and therefore would I aduise you, to be a little madder, 
then Master Quarlous, hereafter.

Banbury, a Suite that puts in here at meale-tyde, to praise the 
painefull brethren, or pray that the sweet fingers may be restor'd; 
Sayes a grace as long as his breath lasts him!  Some time the spirit 
is so strong with him, it gets quite out of him, and then my mother, 
or Win, are faine to fetch it againe with Malmesey, or Aqua 
cælestis.

None but a scatterd couey of Fidlers, or one of these Rag-rakers

                  <p>Hoy-day!  how respectiue you are become of the sudden! 
I feare this family will turne you reformed too, pray you 
come about againe.  Because she is in possibility to be your daughter in Law, 
and may aske you blessing hereafter, when she courts it 
to Totnam to eat creame.  Well, I will forbeare, Sir, but i'faith, 
would thou wouldst leaue thy exercise of widdow-hunting once! 
this drawing after an old reuerend Smocke by the splay-foote: 
There cannot be an ancient Tripe or Trillibub in the Towne, but thou 
art straight nosing it, and it is a fine occupation thou wilt confine thy selfe 
to when thou hast got one; scrubbing a piece of Buffe, as if 
thou hadst the perpetuity of Pannyer-alley to stinke in; or perhaps, 
worse, currying a carkasse, that thou hast bound thy selfe to aliue. 
I will be sworne, some of them, (that thou art, or hast beene a Suitor 
to) are so old, as no chast or marryed pleasure can euer become 
them:  the honest Instrument or procreation, has (forty yeeres 
since) left to belong to them, thou must visit them, as thou wouldst 
do a Tombe, with a Torch, or three hand-fulls of Lincke, flaming 
hot, and so thou maist hap to make them feele thee, and after, 
come to inherit according to thy inches.  A sweet course for a man 
to waste the brand of life for, to be still raking himselfe a fortune 
in an old womans embers; we shall have thee after thou hast beene 
but a moneth marryed to one of them, looke like the quartane ague, 
and the black Iaundise met in a face, and walke as if thou hadst borrow'd 
legges of a Spinner, and voyce of a Cricket.  I would endure 
to heare fifteene Sermons a weeke for her, and such course, and 
lowd one's, as some of them must be; I would een desire of Fate, I 
might dwell in a drumme, and take in my sustenance, with an old 
broken Tobacco-pipe and a Straw.  Dost thou euer thinke to 
bring thine eares or stomack, to the patience of a drie grace, as long 
as thy Tablecloth?  and droan'd out by thy sonne, here, (that might 
be thy father;) till all the meat of thy board has forgot, it was that 
day in the Kitchin?  Or to brooke the noise made, in a question of 
Predestination, by the good labourers and painefull eaters, assembled 
together, put to them by the Matron, your Spouse; who moderates 
with a cup of wine, euer and anone, and a Sentence out of 
Knoxe between?  or the perpetuall spitting, before, and after a sober 
drawne exhortation of six houres, whose better part was the hum-ha-hum? 
Or to heare prayers groan'd out, ouer thy iron-chests, as if 
they were charmes to breake them?  And all this for the hope of 
two Apostle-spoones, to suffer!  and a cup to eate a cawdle in!  For 
that will be thy legacy.  She will have conuey'd her state, safe enough 
from thee, if she be a right widdow.

(in spic'd conscience) those Cakes he made, were seru'd to Bridales, 
May-poles, Morrisses, and such prophane feasts and meetings;

                  <p>Aye, for there was a Blew-starch-woman of the name, at 
the same time.  A notable hypocriticall vermine it is; I know him. 
One that stands upon his face, more then his faith, at all times; 
Euer in seditious motion, and reprouing for vaine-glory:  of a 
most lunatique conscience, and splene, and affects the violence of 
Singularity in all he does:  (He has vndone a Grocer here, in Newgate-market, 
that broke with him, trusted him with Currans, as 
errant a Zeale as he, that is by the way:  by his profession, he will 
euer be in the state of Innocence, though; and child-hood; derides 
all Antiquity; defies any other Learning, then Inspiration; and 
what discretion soeuer, yeeres should afford him, it is all preuented 
in his Originall ignorance; have not to do with him:  for he is 
a fellow of a most arrogant, and inuincible dulnesse, I assure you; 
who is this?

eight pence for the boxe; I could have sau'd two pence in that, if I had

                  <p>Pardon me, Sir, neither they nor you, can apprehend 
me, yet.  (you are an Asse) I have a young Master, he is now 
upon his making and marring; the whole care of his well doing, 
is now mine.  His foolish scholemasters have done nothing, but 
runne up and downe the Countrey with him, to beg puddings, and 
cake-bread, of his tennants, and almost spoyled him, he has learn'd 
nothing, but to sing Catches, and repeat rattle bladder rattle, and 
O, Madge.  I dare not let him walke alone, for feare of learning 
of vile tunes, which he will sing at supper, and in the 
sermon-times!  if he meete but a Carman in the streete, and I 
finde him not talke to keepe him off of him, he will whistle 
him, and all his tunes ouer, at night in his sleepe!  he has a head ful 
of Bees!  I am faine now (for this little time I am absent) to leaue 
him in charge with a Gentlewoman; It is true, she is a Iustice of Peace 
his wife, and a Gentlewoman of the hood, and his naturall 
sister; But what may happen, vnder a womans gouernment, 
there is the doubt.  Gentlemen, you do not know him:  he is another 
manner of peece then you think for!  but nineteen yeere old, 
and yet he is taller then either of you, by the head, God 
blesse him.

it is true; and yesterday in the afternoone, we walk'd London, to shew 
the City to the Gentlewoman, he shall marry, Mistresse Grace; but, 
afore I will endure such another halfe day, with him, I will be drawne 
with a good Gib-cat, through the great pond at home, as his vncle 
Hodge was!   why, we could not meet the heathen thing, all day, but 
stayd him:  he would name you all the Signes ouer, as he went, 
aloud:  and where he spi'd a Parrat, or a Monkey, there he was 
pitch'd, with all the littl-long-coats about him, male and female; 
no getting him away!  I thought he would have runne madde of the 
blacke boy in Bucklers-bury, that takes the scury, roguy tobacco, 
there.

I neuer saw a Licence.

               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>If you loue me, good Numpes.

                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I loue you, and yet I do not loue you, in these fooleries, 
set your heart at rest; there is nothing in it, but hard words: 
and what would you see it for? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>I would see the length and the breadth of it, that is all; 
and I will see it now, so I will. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H</speaker>

                  <speaker>G</speaker>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>Why, do so, a man must give way him a little in 
trifles:  Gentlemen.  These are errors, diseases of youth:  which 
he will mend, when he comes to iudgement, and knowledge of 
matters.  I pray you conceiue so, and I thanke you.  And I pray 
you pardon him, and I thanke you againe.

                  <speaker>F</speaker>
                  <p>Accuse him?  it confesses him one without accusing.

                  <p>Well, Numpes, I am now for another piece of businesse 
more, the Fayre, Numpes, and then — 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>Blesse me!  deliuer me, helpe, hold me!  the Fayre!

               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, neuer fidge up and downe, Numpes, and vexe it selfe. 
I am resolute Bartholmew, in this; 	I will make no suite of it to 
you; it was all the end of my journey, indeed, to shew Mistris Grace 
my Fayre:  I call it my Fayre, because of Bartholmew:  you know my 
name is Bartholmew, and Bartholmew Fayre.

                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>That was mine afore, Gentlemen:  this morning, I had 
that i'faith, upon his Licence, beleeue me, there he comes, after me. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F</speaker>
                  <p>Come, Iohn, this ambitious wit of yours, (I am afraid) 
will do you no good in the end. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A</speaker>

                  <speaker>F</speaker>
                  <p>You grow so insolent with it, and ouerdoing, Iohn:  that 
if you looke not to it, and tie it up, it will bring you to some obscure 
place in time, and there it will leaue you. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>E</speaker>
                  <p>Do not trust it too much, Iohn, be more sparing, and 
vse it, but now and then; a wit is a dangerous thing, in this age; 
do not ouer buy it. 
</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>A prety little soule, this same Mistris Little-wit!  would

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>Numps, I will see it, Numpes, it is decreed:  neuer be melancholy 
for the matter.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>Why, see it, Sir, see it, do see it!  who hinders you? 
why do you not go see it?  'Slid see it. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>The Fayre, Numps, the Fayre.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>Would the Fayre and all the drums, and Rattles in it, 
were in your belly for me:  they are already in your braine:  he that 
had the meanes to trauell you head, now, should meet finer sights 
then any are in the Fayre; and make a finer voyage of it; to see it 
all hung with cockle-shels, pebbles, fine wheat-strawes, and here 
and there a chicken's feather, and a cob-web.

                  <p>Goodfaith, he lookes, me thinkes if you marke him, 
like one that were made to catch flies, with his Sir Cranion legs.

                  <p>God, be with you, Sir, there is your Bee in a box, and much 
good do it, you.

                  <speaker>J</speaker>
                  <p>You will not let him go, Brother, and loose him? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>Who can hold that will away?  I had rather loose him 
then the Fayre, I wusse.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>You do not know the inconuenience, Gentlemen, 
you perswade to:  nor what trouble I have with him in these humours. 
If he go to the Fayre, he will buy of euery thing, to a Baby 
there; and houshold-stuffe for that too.  If a legge or an arme 
on him did not grown on, he would lose it in the presse.  Pray heauen 
I bring him off with one stone!  And then he is such a Rauener 
after fruite!  you will not beleeue what a coyle I had, the other day, 
to compound a businesse betweene a Katerne-peare-woman, and 
him, about snatching!  it is intolerable, Gentlemen. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>E</speaker>
                  <p>O!  but you must not leaue him, now, to these hazards, 
Numpes.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, he knowes too well, I will not leaue him, and 
that makes him presume:  well, Sir, will you go now?  if you 
have such an itch in your feete, to foote it to the Fayre, why do 
you stop, am I your Tarriars?  go, will you go?  Sir, why do 
you not go? 
</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>O Numps!  have I brought you about?  come Mistresse Grace, 
and Sister, I am resolute Batt i'faith, still.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>K</speaker>
                  <p>Truely, I have no such fancy to the Fayre; nor ambition 
to see it; there is none goes thither of any quality or fashion.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>O Lord, Sir!  you shall pardon me, Mistris Grace, we are 
inow of our selues to make it a fashion:  and for qualities, let 
Numps alone, he will find qualities.

                  <speaker>E</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, and offer to marry to her?  well, I will leaue the chase 
of my widdow, for to day, and directly to the Fayre.  These flies

Win, a Puppet-play of mine owne making, say nothing, that I writ 
for the motion man, which you must see, Win.

at a pinch, good Wit come, come, good Wit, if it be thy will.)  I 
have it, Win, I have it 'i faith, and it is a fine one.  Win, long to eate 
of a Pigge, sweet Win, in the Fayre; do you see?  in the heart of the 
Fayre; not at Pye-Corner.  Your mother will do any thing, Win, 
to satisfie your longing, you know, pray thee long, presently, and 
be sicke on the sudden, good Win. I will go in and tell her, cut thy 
lace in the meane time, and play the Hypocrite, sweet Win.

                  <p>Presently, mother, as soone as he had cleans'd his beard. 
I found him, fast by the teeth, in the cold Turkey-pye, in the cupbord, 
with a great white loafe on his left hand, and a glasse of Malmesey 
on his right.

                  <p>O brother Busy!  your helpe here to edifie, and raise us 
up in a scruple; my daughter Win-the-fight is visited with a naturall 
disease of women; call'd, A longing to eate Pigge. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>Aye Sir, a Bartholmew pigge:  and in the Fayre. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C</speaker>
                  <p>And I would be satisfied from you, Religiously-wise, 
whether a widdow of the sanctified assembly, or a widdowes 
daughter, may commit the act, without offence to the weaker 
sisters. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D</speaker>
                  <p>Verily, for the disease of longing, it is a disease, a carnall 
disease, or appetite, incident to women:  and as it is carnall, and 
incident, it is naturall, very naturall:  Now Pigge, it is a meat, and 
a meat that is nourishing, and may be long'd for, and so consequently 
eaten; it may be eaten; very exceeding well eaten:  but in 
the Fayre, and as a Bartholmew-pig, it cannot be eaten, for the very 
calling it a Bartholmew-pigge, and to eat it so, is a spice of Idolatry, 
and you make the Fayre, no better then one of the high Places.  This 
I take it, is the state of the question.  A high place. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, but in state of necessity:  Place should give place, Mr Busy, 
(I have a conceit left, yet.) 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C</speaker>
                  <p>Good Brother, Zeale-of-the-land, thinke to make it as 
lawfull as you can. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>Yes Sir, and as soone as you can:  for it must be Sir; 
you see the danger my little wife is in, Sir. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C</speaker>
                  <p>Truely, I do loue my child dearely, and I would not 
have her miscarry, or hazard her first fruites, if it might be otherwise. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D</speaker>
                  <p>Surely, it may be otherwise, but it is subiect, to construction, 
subiect, and hath a face of offence, with the weake, a great 
face, a foule face, but that face may have a vaile put ouer it, and be 
shaddowed, as it were, it may be eaten, and in the Fayre, I take it, 
in a Booth, the tents of the wicked:  the place is not much, not very 
much, we may be religious in midst of the prophane, so it be eaten 
with a reformed mouth, with sobriety, and humblenesse; not 
gorg'd in with gluttony, or greedinesse; there is the feare:  for, 
should she go there, as taking pride in the place, or delight in the 
vncleane dressing, to feed the vanity of the eye, or the lust of the 
palat, it were not well, it were not fit, it were abominable, and 
not good.

               </sp>

                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I knew that afore, and told her of it, but courage, 
Win, we will be humble enough; we will seeke out the homeliest Booth 
in the Fayre, that is certaine, rather then faile, we will eate it on the 
ground. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>C</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, and I will go with you my selfe, Win-the-fight, and my 
brother, Zeale-of-the-Land, shall go with us too, for our better consolation.

                  <p>Aye, and Salomon too, Win, (the more the merrier) Win, 
we will leave Rabby Busy in a Booth.  Salomon, my cloake.

                  <speaker>D</speaker>
                  <p>In the way of comfort to the weake, I will go, and eat. 
I will eate exceedingly, and prophesie; there may be a good vse 
made of it, too, now I thinke of it:  by the publike eating of Swines 
flesh, to professe our hate, and loathing of Iudaisme, whereof the 
brethren stand taxed.  I will therefore eate, yet, I will eate exceedingly.

no Iew, I could neuer away with that stiffenecked generation:  and 
truely, I hope my little one will be like me, that cries for Pigge so, 
in the mothers belly.

                  <p>Well, in Iustice name, and the Kings; and 
for the common-wealth!  defie all the 
world, Adam Ouerdoo, for a disguise, and 
all story; for thou hast fitted thy selfe, 
I sweare; faine would I meet the Linceus 
now, that Eagles eye, that peircing Epidaurian 
serpent (as my Q<hi rend="sup">uint</hi> Horace cal's 
him) that could discouer a Iustice of Peace, 
(and lately of the Quorum) vnder 
this couering.  They may have seene many 
a foole in the habite of a Iustice; but neuer till now, a Iustice in 
the habit of a foole.  Thus must we do, though, that wake for 
the publike good:  and thus hath the wise Magistrate done in all 
ages.  There is a doing of right out of wrong, if the way be found. 
Neuer shall I enough commend a worthy worshipfull man, sometime 
a capitall member of this City, for his high wisdome, in this 
point, who would take you, now the habit of a Porter; now of a 
Carman; now of the Dog-killer, in this moneth of August; and in 
the winter, of a Seller of tinder-boxes; and what would he do in 
all these shapes?  mary go you into euery Alehouse, and down into 
euery Celler; measure the length of puddings, take the gage of 
blacke pots, and cannes, Aye, and custards with a sticke; and their 
circumference, with a third; weigh the loaues of bread on his 
middle-finger; then would he send for them, home; give the puddings 
to the poore, the bread to the hungry, the custards to his 
children; breake the pots, and burne the cannes, himselfe; he 
Would not trust his corrupt officers; he would do it himselfe. 
would all men in authority would follow this worthy president! 
For (alas) as we are publike persons, what do we know?  nay, 
what can we know?  we heare with other mens eares; we see 
with other mens eyes?  a foolish Constable, of a sleepy Watchman, 
is all our information, he slanders a Gentleman, by the vertue 
of his place, (as he calls it) and we by the vice of ours, must beleeue 
him.  As a while agone, they made me, yea me, to mistake 
an honest zealous Pursiuant, for a Seminary:  and a proper yong 
Batcheler of Musicke, for a Bawd.  This we are subiect to, that 
liue in high place, all our intelligence is idle, and most of our 
intelligencers, knaues:  and by your leaue, our selues, thought 
little better, if not errant fooles, for beleeuing them.  I Adam Ouerdoo, 
am resolu'd therefore, to spare spy-money hereafter, and 
make mine owne discoueries.  Many are the yeerely enormities 
of this Fayre, in whose courts of Pye-pouldres I have had the honour 
during the three dayes sometimes to sit as Iudge.  But this 
is the speciall day for detection of those foresaid enormities.  Here 
is my blacke booke, for the purpose; this the cloud that hides me: 
vnder this couert I shall see, and not be seene.  On Iunius Brutus. 
And as I began, so I will end:  in Iustice name, and the Kings; 
and for the Common-wealth.

I am, I feele my selfe dropping already, as fast as I can:  two stone of 
sewet aday is my proportion:  I can but hold life and soule together, 
with this (here is to you, Nightingale) and a whiffe of tobacco, 
at most.  Where is my pipe now?  not fill'd?  thou errant Incubee.

trust, Tapster, a man of reckoning vnder me, that remembers nothing 
I say to him?  but looke to it, sirrah, you were best, three 
pence a pipe full, I will have made, of all my whole halfe pound of 
tabacco, and a quarter of a pound of Colesfoot, mixt with it too, to 
itch it out.  I that have dealt so long in the fire, will not be to seek in 
smoak, now.  Then 6. and 20. shillings a barrell I will aduance on my 
Beere; and fifty shillings a hundred on my bottle-ale, I have told you 
the waies how to raise it.  Froth your cannes well in the filling, at 
length Rogue, and iogge your bottles on the buttocke, Sirrah, then 
skinke out the first glasse, euer, and drinke with all companies, 
though you be sure to be drunke; you will mis-reckon the better, 
and be lesse asham'd of it.  But your true tricke, Rascall, must be, to 
be euer busie, and mis-take away the bottles and cannes, in hast, before 
they be halfe drunke off, and neuer heare any body call, (if 
they should chance to marke you) till you have brought fresh, and 
be able to forsweare them.  Give me a drinke of Ale.

are still bottle ale and tabacco, for which the Lecturer reads, and 
the Nouices pay.  Thirty pound a weeke in bottle ale!  forty in tabacco! 
and ten more in Ale againe.  Then for a sute to drinke in, 
so much, and (that being slauer'd) so much for another sute, and 
then a third sute, and a fourth sute!  and still the bottle ale slauereth,

                  <p>Nay it is all gone, now!  this it is, when 
thou wilt not be phitin call, Master Offisher, 
what is a man the better to lishen 
out noyshes for thee, if thou art in an oder 'orld, 
being very shuffishient noyshes 
and gallantsh too, one of their brabblesh 
would have fed us all this fortnight, but 
thou art so bushy about beggersh stil, thou 
hast no leshure to intend thentlemen, 
if it be. 
Why, I told you, Dauy Bristle. 
Come, come, you told me a pudding, Toby Haggise; A 
matter of nothing; I am sure it came to nothing!  you said, let us 
go to Vrsla's, indeede; but then you met the man with the monsters, 
and I could not get you from him.  An old foole, not leaue 
seeing yet? 
Why, who would have thought any body would have quarrell'd 
so earely?  or that the ale of the Fayre would have beene 
up so soone. 
Why?  what a clocke toest thou tinke it is, man? 
I cannot tell. 
Thou art a vishe vatchman, in the meane teeme. 
Why?  should the watch go by the clocke, or the clock 
by the watch, I pray? 
One should go by another, if they did well. 
Thou art right now!  when didst thou euer know, or heare 
of a shuffishient vatchman, but he did tell the clocke, what bushinesse 
soeuer he had? 
Nay, that is most true, a sufficient watchman knowes 
what a clocke it is. 
Shleeping, or vaking!  as well as the clocke himshelfe, or 
the lack that shtrikes him! 
Let us enquire of Master Leatherhead, or Ione Trash here. 
Master Leatherhead, do you heare, Master Leatherhead?

you?  as in Lubberland?  and cry, wee, wee?

offer it selfe, by other meanes, to the sense, as by way of steeme, 
which I thinke it doth, here in this place,

and it were a sinne of obstinacy, great obstinacy, high and horrible

satisfie your wiues frailty.  Let your fraile wife be satisfied:  your 
zealous mother, and my suffering selfe, will also be satisfied.

Hundred:  if I had but as much Title to her, as to have breath'd 
once on that streight stomacher of hers, I would now assure my selfe 
to carry her, yet, ere she went out of Smithfield. Or she should 
carry me, which were the fitter sight, I confesse. But you are a modest 
vndertaker, by circumstances, and degrees; come, it is Disease 
in thee, not Iudgement, I should offer at all together.  Looke, here is 
the poore foole, againe, that was flung by the waspe, ere while.

                  <p>I will make no more orations, shall draw on these tragicall conclusions. 
And I begin now to thinke, that by a spice of collaterall 
Iustice, Adam Ouerdoo, deseru'd this beating; for I the said Adam, 
was one cause (a by-cause) why the purse was lost:  and my wiues 
brothers purse too, which they know not of yet.  But I shall make 
very good mirth with it, at supper, (that will be the sport) and put 
my little friend, Mr Humphrey Wasp's choler quite out of countenance. 
When, sitting at the upper end of my Table, as I vse, and drinking 
to my brother Cokes, and M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Alice Ouerdoo, as I will, my wife, for 
their good affection to old Bradley, I deliuer to them, it was I, that was 
cudgell'd, and shew them the marks.  To see what bad euents may 
peepe out of the taile of good purposes!  the care I had of that ciuil 
yong man, I tooke fancy to this morning, (and have not left it yet) 
drew me to that exhortation, which drew the company, indeede, 
which drew the cut-purse; which drew the money; which drew 
my brother Cokes his losse; which drew on Wasp's anger; which 
drew on my beating:  a pretty gradation!  And they shall have it 
in their dish, i'faith, at night for fruit:  I loue to be merry at my Table. 
I had thought once, at one speciall blow he ga' me, to have reuealed 
my selfe?  but then (I thank thee fortitude) I remembered 
that a wise man (and who is euer so great a part, of the Common-wealth 
in himselfe) for no particular disaster ought to abandon a 
publike good designe.  The husbandman ought not for one vnthankful 
yeer, to forsake the plough; The Shepheard ought not, for 
one scabb'd sheep, to throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot ought not 
for one leake in the poope, to quit the Helme; Nor the Alderman 
ought not for one custerd more, at a meale, to give up his cloake; 
The Constable ought not to breake his staffe, and forsweare the 
watch, for one roaring night; Nor the Piper of the Parish (Vt paruis 
componere magna solebam) to put up his pipes, for one rainy 
Sunday.  These are certaine knocking conclusions; out of which, 
I am resolu'd, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come 
the hurdle, (welcome all) I will not discouer who I am, till my 
due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I said euer, in Iustice name, 
and the King's, and for the Common-wealth.

your great citty-suppers, to put downe Coriat, and Cokeley, and bin

                  <p>To have my peneworths out on you:  Bud.  No lesse then 
two purses a day, serue you?  I thought you a simple fellow, 
when my man Numpes beate you, in the morning, and pittied 
you —

                  <p>So did I, I will be sworne, brother; but now I see he is

                  <p>Sir, Sir, keepe your debauch, and your fine Bartholmew-termes 
to your selfe; and make as much on them as you please.  But 
give me this from you, in the meane time:  I beseech you, see if I can 
looke to this.

                  <speaker>H</speaker>
                  <p>Why?  because you are an Asse, Sir, there is a reason 
the shortest way, and you will need have it; now you have got the 
trick of losing, you would lose your breech, if it it were loose.  I know 
you, Sir, come, deliuer, you will go and cracke the vermine, you 
breed now, will you?  it is very fine, will you have the truth of it? 
they are such retchlesse flies as your are, that blow cutpurses abroad 
in euery corner; your foolish hauing of money, makes them. 
If there were no wiser then I, Sir, the trade should lye open for 
you, Sir, it should i'faith, Sir.  I would teach your wit to come to 
your head, Sir, as well as your land to come into your hand, I assure 
you, Sir.

                  <p>Do not deny it. You are a cutpurse, Sir, this Gentleman 
here, and I, saw you, nor do we meane to detect you (though 
we can sufficiently informe our selues, toward the danger of concealing 
you) but you must do us a piece of seruice.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, your beginning shall bring on your ending, for us. 
We are no Catchpoles nor Constables.  That you are to vndertake, 
is this; you saw the old fellow, with the blacke boxe, here? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>N</speaker>

                  <p>That same:  I see, you have flowne him to a marke already. 
I would have you get away that boxe from him, and bring 
it us. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Would you have the boxe and all, Sir?  or onely that, 
that is in it?  I will get you that, and leaue him the boxe, to play with 
still:  (which will be the harder of the two) because I would gaine 
your worships good opinion of me.

                  <speaker>N</speaker>

neuer read word at my need.  Where shall I find you? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F</speaker>
                  <p>Some-where in the Fayre, heereabouts.  Dispatch it 
quickly.  I would faine see the carefull foole deluded!  of all Beasts, 
I loue the serious Asse.  He that takes paines to be one, and playes 
the foole, with the greatest diligence that can be.

                  <p>Then you would not chose, Sir, but loue my Guardian, 
Iustice Ouerdoo, who is answerable to that description, in euery 
haire of him.

                  <speaker>K</speaker>
                  <p>Faith, through a common calamity, he bought me, Sir; 
and now he will marry me to his wiues brother, this wise Gentleman, 
that you see, or else I must pay value of my land.

with some crafty fellow, some picklocke of the Law!  Would I had 
studied a yeere longer in the Innes of Court, if it had beene but 
in your case.

Whit, and very Vrsla, her selfe, is all vanity.

the rest were.  For long haire, it is an Ensigne of pride, a banner, 
and the world is full of those banners, very full of Banners.  And, 
bottle-ale is a drinke of Sathan's, a diet-drinke of Sathans, deuised 
to puffe us up, and make us swell in this latter age of vanity, 
as the smoake of tabacco, to keepe us in mist and error:  But the 
fleshly woman, (which you call Vrsla) is aboue all to be auoyded, 
hauing the marks upon her, of the three enemies of Man, the 
World, as being in the Faire; the Deuill, as being in the fire; and 
and the Flesh, as being her selfe.

                  <p>Sure you thinke me a woman of an extreme leuity, Gentlemen, 
or a strange fancy, that (meeting you by chance in such a 
place, as this, both at one instant, and not yet of two hours acquaintance, 
neither of you deseruing afore the other, of me) I should so 
forsake my modesty (though I might affect one more particularly) 
as to say, This is he, and name him. 
</p>

you?

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>K</speaker>
                  <p>If you would not give it to my modesty, allow it yet to 
my wit; give me so much of woman, and cunning, as not to betray 
my selfe impertinently.  How can I iudge of you, so farre as to 
a choyse, without knowing you more?  you are both equall, and 
alike to me, yet:  and so indifferently affected by me, as each of 
you might be the man, if the other were away.  For you are reasonable 
creatures, you have vnderstanding, and discourse.  And 
if fate send me an vnderstanding husband, I have no feare at all, but 
mine owne manners shall make him a good one.

write either of you, here, a word, or a name, what you like best; 
but of two, or three syllables at most:  and the next person that 
comes this way (because Destiny has a high hand in businesse of 
this nature) I will demand, which of the two words, he, or she doth 
approue; and according to that sentence, fixe my resolution, and 
affection, without change.

tender my selfe.

see it, it is not worth speaking on.  The act is nothing, without a 
witnesse.  Yonder he is, your man with the boxe falne into the finest 
company, and so transported with vapours, they have got in a 
Northren Clothier, and one Puppy, a Westerne man, that is come 
to wrastle before my Lord Maior, anone, and Captaine Whit, and 
one Val Cutting, that helpes Captaine Iordan to roare, a circling 
boy:  with whom your Numps, is so taken, that you may strip him 
of his cloathes, if you will.  I will vndertake to geld him for you; if 
you had but a Surgeon, ready, to seare him.  And Mistresse Iustice, 
there, is the goodest woman!  she does so loue them all ouer, in

that I beseech you come away Gentlemen, and see it.

are great dunghills.  Euery Pettifoggers wife, has them, for first he 
buyes a Coach, that he may marry, and then he marries that he 
may be made Cuckold in it:  For if their wiues ride not to their 
Cuckolding, they do them no credit.  Hide, and be hidden; ride, 
and be ridden, sayes the vapours of experience.

to whom you made your offers.  But go your wayes, talke 
not to me, the hangman is onely fit to discourse with you; the 
hand of Beadle is too mercifull a punishment for your Trade of 
life.  I am sorry I employ'd this fellow; for he thinks me such: Facinus 
quos inquinat, æquat.  But, it was for sport.  And would I make 
it serious, the getting of this Licence is nothing to me, without other 
circumstances concurre.  I do thinke how impertinently I labour, 
if the word be not mine, that the ragged fellow mark'd: 
And what aduantage I have giuen Ned Win-wife in this time now, 
of working her, though it be mine.  He will go neare to forme to her 
what a debauch'd Rascall I am, and fright her out of all good conceipt 
of me:  I should do so by him, I am sure, if I had the opportunity. 
But my hope is in her temper, yet; and it must needs be 
next to despaire, that is grounded on any part of a woman's discretion. 
I would give by my troth, now, all I could spare (to my 
cloathes, and my sword) to meete my tatter'd sooth-sayer againe, 
who was my iudge in the question, to know certainly whose word 
he has damn'd or sau'd.  For, till then, I liue but vnder a Repreiue. 
I must seeke him.  Who be these?

him, for all the cunning mens promises.  Good Sir, heare me, I am 
worth sixe thousand pound, my loue to you, is become my racke, 
I will tell you all, and the truth:  since you hate the hyporisie of the 
party-coloured brother-hood.  These seuen yeeres, I have beene a 
wilfull holy widdow, onely to draw feasts, and gifts from my intangled 
suitors:  I am also by office, an assisting sister of the Deacons, 
and a deuourer, in stead of a distributer of the alms.  I am a speciall 
maker of marriages for our decayed Brethren, with our rich widdowes; 
for a third part of their wealth, when they are marryed, 
for the reliefe of the poore elect:  as also our poore handsome yong 
Virgins, with our wealthy Batchelors, or Widdowers; to make 
them steale from their husbands, when I have confirmed them in 
the faith, and got all put into their custodies.  And if I have not 
my bargaine, they may sooner turne a scolding drab, in to a silent 
Minister, then make me leaue pronouncing reprobation, and damnation 
vnto them.  our elder, Zeale-of-the-land, would have had me, 
but I know him to be the capitall Knaue of the land, making himselfe 
riche, by being made Feoffee in trust to deceased Brethren, and 
coozning their heyres, by swearing the absolute gift of their inheritance. 
And thus hauing eas'd my conscience, and vtter'd my 
heart, with the tongue of my loue:  enioy all my deceits together. 
I beseech you.  I should not have reuealed this to you, but that in 
time I thinke you are mad, and I hope you will thinke me so too, 
Sir?

sure of; there is no expectation for me there!  here I may make my selfe 
some sauer, yet, if she continue mad, there is the question. 
It is money that I want, why should I not marry the money, when 
it is offer'd me?  I have a License and all, it is but razing out one 
name, and putting in another.  There is no playing with a man's

                  <p>Well, my conscience is much eas'd; I have done my part, 
though it doth him no good, yet Adam hath offer'd satisfaction! 
The sting is remoued from hence:  poore man, he is much alter'd 
with his affliction, it has brought him low!  Now, for my other 
worke, reducing the young man (I have follow'd so long in loue) 
from the brinke of his bane, to the center of safety.  Here, or in some 
such like vaine place, I shall be sure to finde him.  I will waite the 
good time.

                  <p>This is he, that acts young Leander, Sir.  He is extreamly 
belou'd of the womenkind, they do so affect his action, the 
green gamesters, that come here, and this is louely Hero; this with 
the beard, Damon; and this pretty Pythias:  this is the ghost of 
King Dionysius in the habit of a scriuener:  as you shall see anone, at 
large.

                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>Well they are a ciuill company, I like them for that; 
they offer not to fleere, nor geere, nor breake iests, as the great 
Players do:  And then, there goes not so much charge to the feasting 
of them, or making them drunke, as to the other, by reason 
of their littlenesse.  Do they vse to play perfect?  Are they neuer 
fluster'd? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L</speaker>
                  <p>No, Sir.  I thanke my industry, and policy for it; they 
are as well gouern'd a company, though I say it — And here is 
young Leander, is as proper an Actor of his inches; and shakes 
his head like an hostler. 
</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L</speaker>
                  <p>By no meanes, Sir. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>No?  How then?

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L</speaker>
                  <p>A better way, Sir, that is too learned, and poeticall for 
our audience; what do they know what Hellespont is?  Guilty of 
true loues blood?  or what Abidos is?  or the other Sestos hight?

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L</speaker>
                  <p>No, I have entreated Master Littewit, to take a little 
paines to reduce it to a more familiar straine for our people. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>How, I pray thee, good M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Litlewit? 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A</speaker>
                  <p>It pleases him to make a matter of it, Sir.  But there is no 
such matter I assure you:  I have onely made it a little easie, and 
moderne for the times, Sir, that is all; As, for the Hellespont I imagine 
our Thames here; and then Leander, I make a Diers sonne, about 
Puddle-wharfe:  and Hero a wench of the Banke-side, who going 
ouer one morning, to old fish-street; Leander spies her land 
at Trigsstayers, and falls in loue with her:  Now do I introduce Cupid, 
hauing Metamorphos'd himselfe into a Drawer, and he strikes 
Hero in loue with a pint of Sherry, and other pretty passages there 
are, of the friendship, that will delight you, Sir, and please you of 
iudgement. 
</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G</speaker>
                  <p>I will be sworne they shall; I am in loue with the Actors already, 
and I will be allyed to them presently.  (They respect gentlemen, 
these fellowes)  Hero shall be my fayring:  But, which of my 
fayrings?  (le' me see) i'faith, my fiddle!  and Leander my fiddle-sticke: 
Then Damon, my drum; and Pythias, my Pipe and the 
ghost of Dionysius, my hobby-horse.  All fitted.

If you have, I will examine the possibility of it, at fit leasure.  Now, 
to my enormities:  looke upon me, O London!  and see me, O 
Smithfield; the example of Iustice, and Mirror of Magistrates:  the 
true top of formality, and scourge of enormity.  Harken vnto my 
labours, and but obserue my discoueries; and compare Hercules with 
me, if thou dar'st, of old; or Columbus; Magellan; or our countrey man 
Drake of later times:  stand forth you weedes of enormity, 
and spread.
