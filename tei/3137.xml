            <p>Something must now be said of this poem, but chiefly, as has 
been done through the whole of these notes, with reference to my 
personal friends, and especially to her who has perseveringly 
taken them down from my dictation. Towards the close of the first 
book stand the lines that were first written, beginning, “Nine 
tedious years,” and ending, “Last human tenant of these ruined 
walls.” These were composed in '95 at Racedown; and for several 
passages describing the employment and demeanour of Margaret 
during her affliction, I was indebted to observations made in 
Dorsetshire, and afterwards at Alfoxden in Somersetshire, where I 
resided in '97 and '98. The lines towards the conclusion of the 
fourth book—beginning, “For, the man, who, in this spirit,” to 
the words “intellectual soul”—were in order of time composed the 
next, either at Racedown or Alfoxden, I do not remember which. The 
rest of the poem was written in the vale of Grasmere, chiefly 
during our residence at Allan Bank. The long poem on my own 
education was, together with many minor poems, composed while we 
lived at the cottage at Town-end. Perhaps my purpose of giving an 
additional interest to these my poems in the eyes of my nearest 
and dearest friends may be promoted by saying a few words upon the 
character of the Wanderer, the Solitary, and the Pastor, and some 
other of the persons introduced. And first, of the principal one, 
the Wanderer. My lamented friend Southey (for this is written a 
month after his decease) used to say that had he been born a 
papist, the course of life which would in all probability have 
been his was the one for which he was most fitted and most to his 
mind,—that of a Benedictine monk in a convent, furnished, as many 
once were and some still are, with an inexhaustible library. 
'Books', as appears from many passages in his writings, and as was 
evident to those who had opportunities of observing his daily 
life, were in fact 'his passion'; and 'wandering', I can with 
truth affirm, was 'mine'; but this propensity in me was happily 
counteracted by inability from want of fortune to fulfil my 
wishes. But, had I been born in a class which would have deprived 
me of what is called a liberal education, it is not unlikely that, 
being strong in body, I should have taken to a way of life such as 
that in which my Pedlar passed the greater part of his days. At 
all events, I am here called upon freely to acknowledge that the 
character I have represented in his person is chiefly an idea of 
what I fancied my own character might have become in his 
circumstances. Nevertheless, much of what he says and does had an 
external existence that fell under my own youthful and subsequent 
observation. An individual named Patrick, by birth and education a 
Scotchman, followed this humble occupation for many years, and 
afterwards settled in the town of Kendal. He married a kinswoman 
of my wife's, and her sister Sarah was brought up from her ninth 
year under this good man's roof. My own imaginations I was happy 
to find clothed in reality, and fresh ones suggested, by what she 
reported of this man's tenderness of heart, his strong and pure 
imagination, and his solid attainments in literature, chiefly 
religious whether in prose or verse. At Hawkshead also, while I 
was a schoolboy, there occasionally resided a Packman (the name 
then generally given to persons of this calling) with whom I had 
frequent conversations upon what had befallen him, and what he had 
observed, during his wandering life; and, as was natural, we took 
much to each other: and, upon the subject of “Pedlarism” in 
general, as 'then' followed, and its favourableness to an intimate 
knowledge of human concerns, not merely among the humbler classes 
of society, I need say nothing here in addition to what is to be 
found in the “Excursion,” and a note attached to it. Now for the 
Solitary. Of him I have much less to say. Not long after we took 
up our abode at Grasmere, came to reside there, from what motive I 
either never knew or have forgotten, a Scotchman a little past the 
middle of life, who had for many years been chaplain to a Highland 
regiment. He was in no respect as far as I know, an interesting 
character, though in his appearance there was a good deal that 
attracted attention, as if he had been shattered in fortune and 
not happy in mind. Of his quondam position I availed myself, to 
connect with the Wanderer, also a Scotchman, a character suitable 
to my purpose, the elements of which I drew from several persons 
with whom I had been connected, and who fell under my observation 
during frequent residences in London at the beginning of the 
French Revolution. The chief of these was, one may 'now' say, a 
Mr. Fawcett, a preacher at a dissenting meeting-house at the Old 
Jewry. It happened to me several times to be one of his 
congregation through my connection with Mr. Nicholson of Cateaton 
Street, who at that time, when I had not many acquaintances in 
London, used often to invite me to dine with him on Sundays; and I 
took that opportunity (Mr. N. being a dissenter) of going to hear 
Fawcett, who was an able and eloquent man. He published a poem on 
war, which had a good deal of merit, and made me think more about 
him than I should otherwise have done. But his Christianity was 
probably never very deeply rooted; and, like many others in those 
times of like showy talents, he had not strength of character to 
withstand the effects of the French Revolution, and of the wild 
and lax opinions which had done so much towards producing it, and 
far more in carrying it forward in its extremes. Poor Fawcett, I 
have been told, became pretty much such a person as I have 
described; and early disappeared from the stage, having fallen 
into habits of intemperance, which I have heard (though I will not 
answer for the fact) hastened his death. Of him I need say no 
more: there were many like him at that time, which the world will 
never be without, but which were more numerous then for reasons 
too obvious to be dwelt upon. 
</p>
            <p>To what is said of the Pastor in the poem I have little to add, 
but what may be deemed superfluous. It has ever appeared to me 
highly favourable to the beneficial influence of the Church of 
England upon all gradations and classes of society, that the 
patronage of its benefices is in numerous instances attached to 
the estates of noble families of ancient gentry; and accordingly I 
am gratified by the opportunity afforded me in the “Excursion,” to 
pourtray the character of a country clergyman of more than 
ordinary talents, born and bred in the upper ranks of society so 
as to partake of their refinements, and at the same time brought 
by his pastoral office and his love of rural life into intimate 
connection with the peasantry of his native district. To 
illustrate the relation which in my mind this Pastor bore to the 
Wanderer, and the resemblance between them, or rather the points 
of community in their nature, I likened one to an oak and the 
other to a sycamore; and, having here referred to this comparison, 
I need only add, I had no one individual in my mind, wishing 
rather to embody this idea than to break in upon the simplicity of 
it, by traits of individual character or of any peculiarity of 
opinion. 
</p>
            <p>And now for a few words upon the scene where these interviews 
and conversations are supposed to occur. The scene of the first 
book of the poem is, I must own, laid in a tract of country not 
sufficiently near to that which soon comes into view in the second 
book, to agree with the fact. All that relates to Margaret and the 
ruined cottage, etc., was taken from observations made in the 
south-west of England, and certainly it would require more than 
seven-league boots to stretch in one morning from a common in 
Somersetshire or Dorsetshire to the heights of Furness Fells and 
the deep valleys they embosom. For thus dealing with space I need 
make, I trust, no apology, but my friends may be amused by the 
truth. In the poem, I suppose that the Pedlar and I ascended from 
a plain country up the vale of Langdale, and struck off a good way 
above the chapel to the western side of the vale. We ascended the 
hill and thence looked down upon the circular recess in which lies 
Blea-Tarn, chosen by the Solitary for his retreat. After we quit 
his cottage, passing over a low ridge we descend into another 
vale, that of Little Langdale, towards the head of which stands, 
embowered or partly shaded by yews and other trees, something 
between a cottage and a mansion or gentleman's house such as they 
once were in this country. This I convert into the Parsonage, and 
at the same time, and as by the waving of a magic wand, I turn the 
comparatively confined vale of Langdale, its Tarn, and the rude 
chapel which once adorned the valley, into the stately and 
comparatively spacious vale of Grasmere, its Lake, and its ancient 
Parish Church; and upon the side of Loughrigg Fell, at the foot of 
the Lake, and looking down upon it and the whole vale and its 
encompassing mountains, the Pastor is supposed by me to stand, 
when at sunset he addresses his companions in words which I hope 
my readers will remember, or I should not have taken the trouble 
of giving so much in detail the materials on which my mind 
actually worked. Now for a few particulars of 'fact' respecting 
the persons whose stories are told or characters are described by 
the different speakers. To Margaret I have already alluded. I will 
add here, that the lines beginning, “She was a woman of a steady 
mind,” faithfully delineate, as far as they go, the character 
possessed in common by many women whom it has been my happiness to 
know in humble life; and that several of the most touching things 
which she is represented as saying and doing are taken from actual 
observation of the distresses and trials under which different 
persons were suffering, some of them strangers to me, and others 
daily under my notice. I was born too late to have a distinct 
remembrance of the origin of the American war, but the state in 
which I represent Robert's mind to be I had frequent opportunities 
of observing at the commencement of our rupture with France in 
'93, opportunities of which I availed myself in the story of the 
Female Vagrant as told in the poem on “Guilt and Sorrow.” The 
account given by the Solitary towards the close of the second 
book, in all that belongs to the character of the Old Man, was 
taken from a Grasmere pauper, who was boarded in the last house 
quitting the vale on the road to Ambleside: the character of his 
hostess, and all that befell the poor man upon the mountain, 
belong to Paterdale: the woman I knew well; her name was 
——— J———, and she was exactly such a person as I describe. The ruins of 
the old chapel, among which the man was found lying, may yet be 
traced, and stood upon the ridge that divides Paterdale from 
Boardale and Martindale, having been placed there for the 
convenience of both districts. The glorious appearance disclosed 
above and among the mountains was described partly from what my 
friend Mr. Luff, who then lived in Paterdale, witnessed upon that 
melancholy occasion, and partly from what Mrs. Wordsworth and I 
had seen in company with Sir George and Lady Beaumont above 
Hartshope Hall on our way from Paterdale to Ambleside. 
</p>
            <p>And now for a few words upon the Church, its Monuments, and the 
Deceased who are spoken of as lying in the surrounding churchyard. 
But first for the one picture, given by the Pastor and the 
Wanderer, of the Living. In this nothing is introduced but what 
was taken from nature and real life. The cottage is called Hacket, 
and stands as described on the southern extremity of the ridge 
which separates the two Langdales: the pair who inhabited it were 
called Jonathan and Betty Yewdale. Once when our children were 
ill, of whooping-cough I think, we took them for change of air to 
this cottage, and were in the habit of going there to drink tea 
upon fine summer afternoons, so that we became intimately 
acquainted with the characters, habits, and lives of these good, 
and, let me say, in the main, wise people. The matron had, in her 
early youth, been a servant in a house at Hawkshead, where several 
boys boarded, while I was a schoolboy there. I did not remember 
her as having served in that capacity; but we had many little 
anecdotes to tell to each other of remarkable boys, incidents and 
adventures which had made a noise in their day in that small town. 
These two persons afterwards settled at Rydal, where they both 
died. 
</p>
            <p>The church, as already noticed, is that of Grasmere. The 
interior of it has been improved lately—made warmer by under- 
drawing the roof and raising the floor—but the rude and antique 
majesty of its former appearance has been impaired by painting the 
rafters; and the oak benches, with a simple rail at the back 
dividing them from each other, have given way to seats that have 
more the appearance of pews. It is remarkable that, excepting only 
the pew belonging to Rydal Hall, that to Rydal Mount, the one to 
the Parsonage, and I believe another, the men and women still 
continue, as used to be the custom in Wales, to sit separate from 
each other. Is this practice as old as the Reformation? and when 
and how did it originate? In the Jewish synagogues and in Lady 
Huntingdon's chapels the sexes are divided in the same way. In the 
adjoining churchyard greater changes have taken place. It is now 
not a little crowded with tombstones; and near the school-house 
which stands in the churchyard is an ugly structure, built to 
receive the hearse, which is recently come into use. It would not 
be worth while to allude to this building or the hearse-vehicle it 
contains, but that the latter has been the means of introducing a 
change much to be lamented in the mode of conducting funerals 
among the mountains. Now, the coffin is lodged in the hearse at 
the door of the house of the deceased, and the corpse is so 
conveyed to the churchyard gate: all the solemnity which formerly 
attended its progress, as described in the poem, is put an end to. 
So much do I regret this, that I beg to be excused for giving 
utterance here to a wish that, should it befall me to die at Rydal 
Mount, my own body may be carried to Grasmere church after the 
manner in which, till lately, that of every one was borne to that 
place of sepulture, namely, on the shoulders of neighbours, no 
house being passed without some words of a funeral psalm being 
sung at the time by the attendants. When I put into the mouth of 
the Wanderer, “Many precious rites and customs of our rural 
ancestry are gone or stealing from us; this I hope will last for 
ever,” and what follows, little did I foresee that the observance 
and mode of proceeding, which had often affected me so much, would 
so soon be superseded. Having said much of the injury done to this 
churchyard, let me add that one is at liberty to look forward to a 
time when, by the growth of the yew-trees, thriving there, a 
solemnity will be spread over the place that will in some degree 
make amends for the old simple character which has already been so 
much encroached upon, and will be still more every year. I will 
here set down, more at length, what has been mentioned in a 
previous note, that my friend Sir George Beaumont, having long ago 
purchased the beautiful piece of water called Loughrigg Tarn, on 
the Banks of which he intended to build, I told him that a person 
in Kendal who was attached to the place wished to purchase it. Sir 
George, finding the possession of no use to him, consented to part 
with it, and placed the purchase-money—twenty pounds—at my 
disposal for any local use which I thought proper. Accordingly I 
resolved to plant yew-trees in the churchyard, and had four pretty 
strong large oak enclosures made, in each of which was planted, 
under my own eye, and principally if not entirely by my own hand, 
two young trees, with the intention of leaving the one that throve 
best to stand. Many years after, Mr. Barber, who will long be 
remembered in Grasmere; Mr. Greenwood, the chief landed 
proprietor; and myself, had four other enclosures made in the 
churchyard at our own expense, in each of which was planted a tree 
taken from its neighbour, and they all stand thriving admirably, 
the fences having been removed as no longer necessary. May the 
trees be taken care of hereafter when we are all gone, and some of 
them will perhaps at some far distant time rival in majesty the 
yew of Lorton and those which I have described as growing in 
Borrowdale, where they are still to be seen in grand assemblage. 
</p>
            <p>And now for the persons that are selected as lying in the 
churchyard. But first for the individual whose grave is prepared 
to receive him. His story is here truly related: he was a school- 
fellow of mine for some years. He came to us when he was at least 
seventeen years of age, very tall, robust, and full-grown. This 
prevented him from falling into the amusements and games of the 
school: consequently he gave more time to books. He was not 
remarkably bright or quick, but by industry he made a progress 
more than respectable. His parents not being wealthy enough to 
send him to college, when he left Hawkshead he became a 
schoolmaster, with a view to prepare himself for holy orders. 
About this time he fell in love as related in the poem, and 
everything followed as there described, except that I do not know 
when and where he died. The number of youths that came to 
Hawkshead school, from the families of the humble yeomanry, to be 
educated to a certain degree of scholarship as a preparation for 
the church, was considerable, and the fortunes of these persons in 
after life various of course, and of some not a little remarkable. 
I have now one of this class in my eye who became an usher in a 
preparatory school and ended in making a large fortune. His 
manners when he came to Hawkshead were as uncouth as well could 
be; but he had good abilities, with skill to turn them to account; 
and when the master of the school, to which he was usher, died, he 
stept into his place and became proprietor of the establishment. 
He contrived to manage it with such address, and so much to the 
taste of what is called high society and the fashionable world, 
that no school of the kind, even till he retired, was in such high 
request. Ministers of state, the wealthiest gentry, and nobility 
of the first rank, vied with each other in bespeaking a place for 
their sons in the seminary of this fortunate teacher. In the 
solitude of Grasmere, while living as a married man in a cottage 
of eight pounds per annum rent, I often used to smile at the tales 
which reached me of his brilliant career. Not two hundred yards 
from the cottage in Grasmere, just mentioned, to which I retired, 
this gentleman, who many years afterwards purchased a small estate 
in the neighbourhood, is now erecting a boat-house, with an upper 
story, to be resorted to as an entertaining-room when he and his 
associates may feel inclined to take their pastime on the lake. 
Every passenger will be disgusted with the sight of this edifice, 
not merely as a tasteless thing in itself, but as utterly out of 
place, and peculiarly fitted, as far as it is observed (and it 
obtrudes itself on notice at every point of view), to mar the 
beauty and destroy the pastoral simplicity of the vale. For my own 
part and that of my household it is our utter detestation, 
standing by a shore to which, before the highroad was made to pass 
that way, we used daily and hourly to repair for seclusion and for 
the shelter of a grove under which I composed many of my poems, 
the “Brothers” especially, and for this reason we gave the grove 
that name. 
<q>
                  <l>“That which each man loved </l>
                  <l>And prized in his peculiar nook of earth </l>
                  <l>Dies with him, or is changed.” </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So much for my old school-fellow and his exploits. I will only 
add that the foundation has twice failed, from the lake no doubt 
being intolerant of the intrusion. 
</p>
            <p>The Miner, next described as having found his treasure after 
twice ten years of labour, lived in Paterdale, and the story is 
true to the letter. It seems to me, however, rather remarkable 
that the strength of mind which had supported him through this 
long unrewarded labour did not enable him to bear its successful 
issue. Several times in the course of my life I have heard of 
sudden influxes of great wealth being followed by derangement, and 
in one instance the shock of good fortune was so great as to 
produce absolute idiocy: but these all happened where there had 
been little or no previous effort to acquire the riches, and 
therefore such a consequence might the more naturally be expected 
than in the case of the solitary Miner. In reviewing his story, 
one cannot but regret that such perseverance was not sustained by 
a worthier object. Archimedes leapt out of his bath and ran about 
the streets proclaiming his discovery in a transport of joy, but 
we are not told that he lost either his life or his senses in 
consequence. The next character, to whom the Priest is led by 
contrast with the resoluteness displayed by the foregoing, is 
taken from a person born and bred in Grasmere, by name Dawson; and 
whose talents, disposition, and way of life were such as are here 
delineated. I did not know him, but all was fresh in memory when 
we settled at Grasmere in the beginning of the century. From this 
point, the conversation leads to the mention of two individuals 
who, by their several fortunes, were, at different times, driven 
to take refuge at the small and obscure town of Hawkshead on the 
skirt of these mountains. Their stories I had from the dear old 
dame with whom, as a schoolboy and afterwards, I lodged for nearly 
the space of ten years. The elder, the Jacobite, was named 
Drummond, and was of a high family in Scotland: the Hanoverian 
Whig bore the name of Vandeput, and might perhaps be a descendant 
of some Dutchman who had come over in the train of King William. 
At all events his zeal was such that he ruined himself by a 
contest for the representation of London or Westminster, 
undertaken to support his party; and retired to this corner of the 
world, selected, as it had been by Drummond, for that obscurity 
which, since visiting the Lakes became fashionable, it has no 
longer retained. So much was this region considered out of the way 
till a late period, that persons who had fled from justice used 
often to resort hither for concealment; and some were so bold as 
to, not unfrequently, make excursions from the place of their 
retreat, for the purpose of committing fresh offences. Such was 
particularly the case with two brothers of the name of Weston who 
took up their abode at Old Brathay, I think about seventy years 
ago. They were highwaymen, and lived there some time without being 
discovered, though it was known that they often disappeared in a 
way and upon errands which could not be accounted for. Their 
horses were noticed as being of a choice breed, and I have heard 
from the Relph family, one of whom was a saddler in the town of 
Kendal, that they were curious in their saddles and housings and 
accoutrements of their horses. They, as I have heard, and as was 
universally believed, were in the end both taken and hanged.

This person lived at Town-end, and was almost our next neighbour. 
I have little to notice concerning her beyond what is said in the 
poem. She was a most striking instance how far a woman may surpass 
in talent, in knowledge, and culture of mind, those with and among 
whom she lives, and yet fall below them in Christian virtues of 
the heart and spirit. It seemed almost, and I say it with grief, 
that in proportion as she excelled in the one, she failed in the 
other. How frequently has one to observe in both sexes the same 
thing, and how mortifying is the reflection!

                  <l>“As, on a sunny bank, a tender lamb </l>
                  <l>Lurks in safe shelter from the winds of March.” </l>
               </q>
The story that follows was told to Mrs. Wordsworth and my sister 
by the sister of this unhappy young woman; and every particular 
was exactly as I have related. The party was not known to me, 
though she lived at Hawkshead, but it was after I left school. The 
clergyman, who administered comfort to her in her distress, I knew 
well. Her sister who told the story was the wife of a leading 
yeoman in the vale of Grasmere, and they were an affectionate pair 
and greatly respected by every one who knew them. Neither lived to 
be old; and their estate—which was perhaps the most considerable 
then in the vale, and was endeared to them by many remembrances of 
a salutary character not easily understood, or sympathised with, 
by those who are born to great affluence—passed to their eldest 
son, according to the practice of these vales, who died soon after 
he came into possession. He was an amiable and promising youth, 
but was succeeded by an only brother, a good-natured man, who fell 
into habits of drinking, by which he gradually reduced his 
property; and the other day the last acre of it was sold, and his 
wife and children and he himself, still surviving, have very 
little left to live upon, which it would not perhaps have been 
worth while to record here but that, through all trials, this 
woman has proved a model of patience, meekness, affectionate 
forbearance, and forgiveness. Their eldest son, who, through the 
vices of his father, has thus been robbed of an ancient family 
inheritance, was never heard to murmur or complain against the 
cause of their distress, and is now (1843) deservedly the chief 
prop of his mother's hopes. 
</p>
            <p>The clergyman and his family described at the beginning of the 
seventh book were, during many years, our principal associates in 
the vale of Grasmere, unless I were to except our very nearest 
neighbours. I have entered so particularly into the main points of 
their history, that I will barely testify in prose that—with the 
single exception of the particulars of their journey to Grasmere, 
which, however, was exactly copied from in another instance—the 
whole that I have said of them is as faithful to the truth as 
words can make it. There was much talent in the family: the eldest 
son was distinguished for poetical talent, of which a specimen is 
given in my notes to the sonnets to the Duddon. Once, when in our 
cottage at Town-end I was talking with him about poetry, in the 
course of conversation I presumed to find fault with the 
versification of Pope, of whom he was an enthusiastic admirer: he 
defended him with a warmth that indicated much irritation: 
nevertheless I would not abandon my point, and said, “In compass 
and variety of sound your own versification surpasses his.” Never 
shall I forget the change in his countenance and tone of voice: 
the storm was laid in a moment; he no longer disputed my judgment, 
and I passed immediately in his mind, no doubt, for as great a 
critic as ever lived. I ought to add, he was a clergyman and a 
well-educated man, and his verbal memory was the most remarkable 
of any individual I have known, except a Mr. Archer, an Irishman, 
who lived several years in this neighbourhood, and who, in this 
faculty, was a prodigy; he afterwards became deranged, and I fear 
continues so, if alive. Then follows the character of Robert 
Walker, for which see notes to the Duddon. Then that of the deaf 
man, whose epitaph may be seen in the churchyard at the head of 
Haweswater, and whose qualities of mind and heart, and their 
benign influence in conjunction with his privation, I had from his 
relatives on the spot. The blind man, next commemorated, was John 
Gough, of Kendal, a man known, far beyond his neighbourhood, for 
his talents and attainments in natural history and science. Of the 
Infant's grave, next noticed, I will only say, it is an exact 
picture of what fell under my own observation; and all persons who 
are intimately acquainted with cottage life must often have 
observed like instances of the working of the domestic affections.

                  <l>“A volley thrice repeated o'er the corse </l>

This young volunteer bore the name of Dawson, and was younger 
brother, if I am not mistaken, to the prodigal of whose character 
and fortunes an account is given towards the beginning of the 
preceding book. The father of the family I knew well; he was a man 
of literary education and of experience in society much beyond 
what was common among the inhabitants of the vale. He had lived a 
good while in the Highlands of Scotland, as a manager of iron- 
works at Bunaw, and had acted as clerk to one of my predecessors 
in the office of Distributor of Stamps, when he used to travel 
round the country collecting and bringing home the money due to 
Government, in gold, which, it may be worth while to mention for 
the sake of my friends, was deposited in the cell or iron closet 
under the west window of the long room at Rydal Mount, which still 
exists with the iron doors that guarded the property. This of 
course was before the time of Bills and Notes. The two sons of 
this person had no doubt been led by the knowledge of their father 
to take more delight in scholarship, and had been accustomed in 
their own minds to take a wider view of social interests than was 
usual among their associates. The premature death of this gallant 
young man was much lamented, and, as an attendant at the funeral, 
I myself witnessed the ceremony and the effect of it as described 
in the poem. 
<q>
                  <l>“Tradition tells </l>
                  <l>That, in Eliza's golden days, a Knight </l>
                  <l>Came on a war-horse.” </l>
                  <l>“The house is gone.” </l>
               </q>
The pillars of the gateway in front of the mansion remained when 
we first took up our abode at Grasmere. Two or three cottages 
still remain, which are called Knott-houses from the name of the 
gentleman (I have called him a knight) concerning whom these 
traditions survive. He was the ancestor of tho Knott family, 
formerly considerable proprietors in the district. What follows in 
the discourse of the Wanderer upon the changes he had witnessed in 
rural life, by the introduction of machinery, is truly described 
from what I myself saw during my boyhood and early youth, and from 
what was often told me by persons of this humble calling. Happily, 
most happily, for these mountains, the mischief was diverted from 
the banks of their beautiful streams, and transferred to open and 
flat countries abounding in coal, where the agency of steam was 
found much more effectual for carrying on those demoralising 
works. Had it not been for this invention, long before the present 
time every torrent and river in this district would have had its 
factory, large and populous in proportion to the power of the 
water that could there have been commanded. Parliament has 
interfered to prevent the night-work which was once carried on in 
these mills as actively as during the daytime, and by necessity 
still more perniciously—a sad disgrace to the proprietors, and to 
the nation which could so long tolerate such unnatural 
proceedings. Reviewing at this late period, 1843, what I put into 
the mouths of my interlocutors a few years after the commencement 
of the century, I grieve that so little progress has been made in 
diminishing the evils deplored, or promoting the benefits of 
education which the Wanderer anticipates. The results of Lord 
Ashley's labours to defer the time when children might legally be 
allowed to work in factories, and his endeavours to limit still 
farther the hours of permitted labour, have fallen far short of 
his own humane wishes, and those of every benevolent and right- 
minded man who has carefully attended to this subject: and in the 
present session of Parliament (1843) Sir James Graham's attempt to 
establish a course of religious education among the children 
employed in factories has been abandoned, in consequence of what 
might easily have been foreseen, the vehement and turbulent 
opposition of the Dissenters: so that, for many years to come, it 
may be thought expedient to leave the religious instruction of 
children entirely in the hands of the several denominations of 
Christians in the island, each body to work according to its own 
means and in its own way. Such is my own confidence, a confidence 
I share with many others of my most valued friends, in the 
superior advantages, both religious and social, which attend a 
course of instruction presided over and guided by the clergy of 
the Church of England, that I have no doubt that, if but once its 
members, lay and clerical, were duly sensible of those benefits, 
their church would daily gain ground, and rapidly, upon every 
shape and fashion of Dissent: and in that case, a great majority 
in Parliament being sensible of these benefits, the Ministers of 
the country might be emboldened, were it necessary, to apply funds 
of the State to the support of education on Church principles. 
Before I conclude, I cannot forbear noticing the strenuous efforts 
made at this time in Parliament, by so many persons, to extend 
manufacturing and commercial industry at the expense of 
agricultural, though we have recently had abundant proofs that the 
apprehensions expressed by the Wanderer were not groundless.

                  <l>With gladness, thinking that the more it spreads </l>
                  <l>The healthier, the securer, we become— </l>
                  <l>Delusion which a moment may destroy!” </l>
               </q>
The Chartists are well aware of this possibility, and cling to it 
with an ardour and perseverance which nothing but wiser and more 
brotherly dealing towards the many, on the part of the wealthy 
few, can moderate or remove.

               </q>
The point here fixed upon in my imagination is half-way up the 
northern side of Loughrigg Fell, from which the Pastor and his 
companions were supposed to look upwards to the sky and mountain- 
tops, and round the vale, with the lake lying immediately beneath 
them. 
<q>
                  <l>“But turned not without welcome promise made, </l>
                  <l>That he would share the pleasures and pursuits </l>

                  <l>In wandering with us.” </l>
               </q>
When I reported this promise of the Solitary, and long after, it 
was my wish, and I might say intention, that we should resume our 
wanderings, and pass the Borders into his native country, where, 
as I hoped, he might witness, in the society of the Wanderer, some 
religious ceremony—a sacrament, say, in the open fields, or a 
preaching among the mountains—which, by recalling to his mind the 
days of his early childhood, when he had been present on such 
occasions in company with his parents and nearest kindred, might 
have dissolved his heart into tenderness, and so have done more 
towards restoring the Christian faith in which he had been 
educated, and, with that, contentedness and even cheerfulness of 
mind, than all that the Wanderer and Pastor, by their several 
effusions and addresses, had been able to effect. An issue like 
this was in my intentions. But, alas!

            <head>PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814</head>
            <p>THE Title-page announces that this is only a portion of a poem; 
and the Reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second 
part of a long and laborious Work, which is to consist of three 
parts.—The Author will candidly acknowledge that, if the first of 
these had been completed, and in such a manner as to satisfy his 
own mind, he should have preferred the natural order of 
publication, and have given that to the world first; but, as the 
second division of the Work was designed to refer more to passing 
events, and to an existing state of things, than the others were 
meant to do, more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon 
it, and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem; 
and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree 
which will materially injure its own peculiar interest, the 
Author, complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued 
Friends, presents the following pages to the Public. 
</p>
            <p>It may be proper to state whence the poem, of which “The 
Excursion” is a part, derives its Title of THE RECLUSE.—Several 
years ago, when the Author retired to his native mountains, with 
the hope of being enabled to construct a literary Work that might 
live, it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of 
his own mind, and examine how far Nature and Education had 
qualified him for such employment. As subsidiary to this 
preparation, he undertook to record, in verse, the origin and 
progress of his own powers, as far as he was acquainted with them. 
That Work [The Prelude], addressed to a dear Friend, most 
distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to whom the 
Author's Intellect is deeply indebted, has been long finished; and 
the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a 
determination to compose a philosophical poem, containing views of 
Man, Nature, and Society; and to be entitled, “The Recluse”; as 
having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a 
poet living in retirement.—The preparatory poem 1 is 
biographical, and conducts the history of the Author's mind to the 
point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were 
sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he 
had proposed to himself; and the two Works have the same kind of 
relation to each other, if he may so express himself, as the ante- 
chapel has to the body of a Gothic church. Continuing this 
allusion, he may be permitted to add, that his minor Pieces, which 
have been long before the Public, when they shall be properly 
arranged, will be found by the attentive Reader to have such 
connection with the main Work as may give them claim to be likened 
to the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses, 
ordinarily included in those edifices. 
</p>
            <p>The Author would not have deemed himself justified in saying, 
upon this occasion, so much of performances either unfinished or 
unpublished, if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him 
upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the Public 
entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks 
necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and, he 
would hope, to benefit his countrymen.—Nothing further need be 
added, than that the first and third parts of “The Recluse” will 
consist chiefly of meditations in the Author's own person; and 
that in the intermediate part (”The Excursion”) the intervention 
of characters speaking is employed, and something of a dramatic 
form adopted. 
</p>
            <p>It is not the Author's intention formally to announce a system; 
it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course; and 
if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts, 
lively images, and strong feelings, the Reader will have no 
difficulty in extracting the system for himself. And in the 
meantime the following passage, taken from the conclusion of the 
first book of “The Recluse,” may be acceptable as a kind of 
“Prospectus” of the design and scope of the whole Poem.

            <head>ARGUMENT</head>
            <p>A summer forenoon—The Author reaches a ruined Cottage upon a 
Common, and there meets with a revered Friend, the Wanderer, of 
whose education and course of life he gives an account—The 
Wanderer, while resting under the shade of the Trees that surround 
the Cottage, relates the History of its last Inhabitant.

            <l n="1.1"> 'TWAS summer, and the sun had mounted high: </l>
            <l n="1.2"> Southward the landscape indistinctly glared </l>
            <l n="1.3"> Through a pale steam; but all the northern downs, </l>
            <l n="1.4"> In clearest air ascending, showed far off </l>
            <l n="1.5"> A surface dappled o'er with shadows flung </l>
            <l n="1.6"> From brooding clouds; shadows that lay in spots </l>
            <l n="1.7"> Determined and unmoved, with steady beams </l>
            <l n="1.8"> Of bright and pleasant sunshine interposed; </l>
            <l n="1.9"> To him most pleasant who on soft cool moss </l>
            <l n="1.10"> Extends his careless limbs along the front </l>
            <l n="1.11"> Of some huge cave, whose rocky ceiling casts </l>
            <l n="1.12"> A twilight of its own, an ample shade, </l>
            <l n="1.13"> Where the wren warbles, while the dreaming man, </l>
            <l n="1.14"> Half conscious of the soothing melody, </l>
            <l n="1.15"> With side-long eye looks out upon the scene, </l>
            <l n="1.16"> By power of that impending covert, thrown </l>
            <l n="1.17"> To finer distance. Mine was at that hour </l>
            <l n="1.18"> Far other lot, yet with good hope that soon </l>
            <l n="1.19"> Under a shade as grateful I should find </l>
            <l n="1.20"> Rest, and be welcomed there to livelier joy. </l>
            <l n="1.21"> Across a bare wide Common I was toiling </l>
            <l n="1.22"> With languid steps that by the slippery turf </l>
            <l n="1.23"> Were baffled; nor could my weak arm disperse </l>
            <l n="1.24"> The host of insects gathering round my face, </l>
            <l n="1.25"> And ever with me as I paced along. </l>
            <l n="1.26">   Upon that open moorland stood a grove, </l>
            <l n="1.27"> The wished-for port to which my course was bound. </l>
            <l n="1.28"> Thither I came, and there, amid the gloom </l>
            <l n="1.29"> Spread by a brotherhood of lofty elms, </l>
            <l n="1.30"> Appeared a roofless Hut; four naked walls </l>
            <l n="1.31"> That stared upon each other!—I looked round, </l>
            <l n="1.32"> And to my wish and to my hope espied </l>
            <l n="1.33"> The Friend I sought; a Man of reverend age, </l>
            <l n="1.34"> But stout and hale, for travel unimpaired. </l>
            <l n="1.35"> There was he seen upon the cottage-bench, </l>
            <l n="1.36"> Recumbent in the shade, as if asleep; </l>
            <l n="1.37"> An iron-pointed staff lay at his side. </l>
            <l n="1.38">   Him had I marked the day before—alone </l>
            <l n="1.39"> And stationed in the public way, with face </l>
            <l n="1.40"> Turned toward the sun then setting, while that staff </l>
            <l n="1.41"> Afforded, to the figure of the man </l>
            <l n="1.42"> Detained for contemplation or repose, </l>
            <l n="1.43"> Graceful support; his countenance as he stood </l>
            <l n="1.44"> Was hidden from my view, and he remained </l>
            <l n="1.45"> Unrecognised; but, stricken by the sight, </l>
            <l n="1.46"> With slackened footsteps I advanced, and soon </l>
            <l n="1.47"> A glad congratulation we exchanged </l>
            <l n="1.48"> At such unthought-of meeting.—For the night </l>
            <l n="1.49"> We parted, nothing willingly; and now </l>
            <l n="1.50"> He by appointment waited for me here, </l>
            <l n="1.51"> Under the covert of these clustering elms. </l>
            <l n="1.52">   We were tried Friends: amid a pleasant vale, </l>
            <l n="1.53"> In the antique market-village where was passed </l>
            <l n="1.54"> My school-time, an apartment he had owned, </l>
            <l n="1.55"> To which at intervals the Wanderer drew, </l>
            <l n="1.56"> And found a kind of home or harbour there. </l>
            <l n="1.57"> He loved me, from a swarm of rosy boys </l>

            <l n="1.59"> For my grave looks, too thoughtful for my years. </l>
            <l n="1.60"> As I grew up, it was my best delight </l>
            <l n="1.61"> To be his chosen comrade. Many a time, </l>
            <l n="1.62"> On holidays, we rambled through the woods: </l>
            <l n="1.63"> We sate—we walked; he pleased me with report </l>
            <l n="1.64"> Of things which he had seen; and often touched </l>
            <l n="1.65"> Abstrusest matter, reasonings of the mind </l>
            <l n="1.66"> Turned inward; or at my request would sing </l>
            <l n="1.67"> Old songs, the product of his native hills; </l>
            <l n="1.68"> A skilful distribution of sweet sounds, </l>
            <l n="1.69"> Feeding the soul, and eagerly imbibed </l>
            <l n="1.70"> As cool refreshing water, by the care </l>
            <l n="1.71"> Of the industrious husbandman, diffused </l>
            <l n="1.72"> Through a parched meadow-ground, in time of drought. </l>
            <l n="1.73"> Still deeper welcome found his pure discourse; </l>
            <l n="1.74"> How precious, when in riper days I learned </l>
            <l n="1.75"> To weigh with care his words, and to rejoice </l>
            <l n="1.76"> In the plain presence of his dignity! </l>
            <l n="1.77">   Oh! many are the Poets that are sown </l>
            <l n="1.78"> By Nature; men endowed with highest gifts, </l>
            <l n="1.79"> The vision and the faculty divine; </l>
            <l n="1.80"> Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse, </l>
            <l n="1.81"> (Which, in the docile season of their youth, </l>
            <l n="1.82"> It was denied them to acquire, through lack </l>
            <l n="1.83"> Of culture and the inspiring aid of books, </l>
            <l n="1.84"> Or haply by a temper too severe, </l>
            <l n="1.85"> Or a nice backwardness afraid of shame) </l>
            <l n="1.86"> Nor having e'er, as life advanced, been led </l>

            <l n="1.90"> Husbanding that which they possess within, </l>
            <l n="1.91"> And go to the grave, unthought of. Strongest minds </l>
            <l n="1.92"> Are often those of whom the noisy world </l>
            <l n="1.93"> Hears least; else surely this Man had not left </l>
            <l n="1.94"> His graces unrevealed and unproclaimed. </l>
            <l n="1.95"> But, as the mind was filled with inward light, </l>
            <l n="1.96"> So not without distinction had he lived, </l>
            <l n="1.97"> Beloved and honoured—far as he was known. </l>
            <l n="1.98"> And some small portion of his eloquent speech, </l>
            <l n="1.99"> And something that may serve to set in view </l>
            <l n="1.100"> The feeling pleasures of his loneliness, </l>
            <l n="1.101"> His observations, and the thoughts his mind </l>
            <l n="1.102"> Had dealt with—I will here record in verse; </l>
            <l n="1.103"> Which, if with truth it correspond, and sink </l>
            <l n="1.104"> Or rise as venerable Nature leads, </l>
            <l n="1.105"> The high and tender Muses shall accept </l>
            <l n="1.106"> With gracious smile, deliberately pleased, </l>
            <l n="1.107"> And listening Time reward with sacred praise. </l>
            <l n="1.108">   Among the hills of Athol he was born; </l>
            <l n="1.109"> Where, on a small hereditary farm, </l>
            <l n="1.110"> An unproductive slip of rugged ground, </l>
            <l n="1.111"> His Parents, with their numerous offspring, dwelt; </l>
            <l n="1.112"> A virtuous household, though exceeding poor! </l>
            <l n="1.113"> Pure livers were they all, austere and grave, </l>
            <l n="1.114"> And fearing God; the very children taught </l>
            <l n="1.115"> Stern self-respect, a reverence for God's word, </l>
            <l n="1.116"> And an habitual piety, maintained </l>
            <l n="1.117"> With strictness scarcely known on English ground. </l>
            <l n="1.118">   From his sixth year, the Boy of whom I speak, </l>
            <l n="1.119"> In summer, tended cattle on the hills; </l>
            <l n="1.120"> But, through the inclement and the perilous days </l>
            <l n="1.121"> Of long-continuing winter, he repaired, </l>
            <l n="1.122"> Equipped with satchel, to a school, that stood </l>
            <l n="1.123"> Sole building on a mountain's dreary edge, </l>
            <l n="1.124"> Remote from view of city spire, or sound </l>
            <l n="1.125"> Of minster clock! From that bleak tenement </l>
            <l n="1.126"> He, many an evening, to his distant home </l>
            <l n="1.127"> In solitude returning, saw the hills </l>
            <l n="1.128"> Grow larger in the darkness; all alone </l>
            <l n="1.129"> Beheld the stars come out above his head, </l>
            <l n="1.130"> And travelled through the wood, with no one near </l>
            <l n="1.131"> To whom he might confess the things he saw. </l>
            <l n="1.132">   So the foundations of his mind were laid. </l>
            <l n="1.133"> In such communion, not from terror free, </l>
            <l n="1.134"> While yet a child, and long before his time, </l>
            <l n="1.135"> Had he perceived the presence and the power </l>
            <l n="1.136"> Of greatness; and deep feelings had impressed </l>
            <l n="1.137"> So vividly great objects that they lay </l>
            <l n="1.138"> Upon his mind like substances, whose presence </l>
            <l n="1.139"> Perplexed the bodily sense. He had received </l>
            <l n="1.140"> A precious gift; for, as he grew in years, </l>
            <l n="1.141"> With these impressions would he still compare </l>
            <l n="1.142"> All his remembrances, thoughts, shapes, and forms; </l>
            <l n="1.143"> And, being still unsatisfied with aught </l>
            <l n="1.144"> Of dimmer character, he thence attained </l>
            <l n="1.145"> An active power to fasten images </l>
            <l n="1.146"> Upon his brain; and on their pictured lines </l>
            <l n="1.147"> Intensely brooded, even till they acquired </l>
            <l n="1.148"> The liveliness of dreams. Nor did he fail, </l>
            <l n="1.149"> While yet a child, with a child's eagerness </l>
            <l n="1.150"> Incessantly to turn his ear and eye </l>
            <l n="1.151"> On all things which the moving seasons brought </l>
            <l n="1.152"> To feed such appetite—nor this alone </l>
            <l n="1.153"> Appeased his yearning:—in the after-day </l>
            <l n="1.154"> Of boyhood, many an hour in caves forlorn, </l>
            <l n="1.155"> And 'mid the hollow depths of naked crags </l>
            <l n="1.156"> He sate, and even in their fixed lineaments, </l>
            <l n="1.157"> Or from the power of a peculiar eye, </l>
            <l n="1.158"> Or by creative feeling overborne, </l>
            <l n="1.159"> Or by predominance of thought oppressed, </l>
            <l n="1.160"> Even in their fixed and steady lineaments </l>
            <l n="1.161"> He traced an ebbing and a flowing mind, </l>
            <l n="1.162"> Expression ever varying! </l>
            <l n="1.163">                           Thus informed, </l>
            <l n="1.164"> He had small need of books; for many a tale </l>
            <l n="1.165"> Traditionary, round the mountains hung, </l>
            <l n="1.166"> And many a legend, peopling the dark woods, </l>
            <l n="1.167"> Nourished Imagination in her growth, </l>
            <l n="1.168"> And gave the Mind that apprehensive power </l>
            <l n="1.169"> By which she is made quick to recognise </l>
            <l n="1.170"> The moral properties and scope of things. </l>
            <l n="1.171"> But eagerly he read, and read again, </l>
            <l n="1.172"> Whate'er the minister's old shelf supplied; </l>
            <l n="1.173"> The life and death of martyrs, who sustained, </l>
            <l n="1.174"> With will inflexible, those fearful pangs </l>
            <l n="1.175"> Triumphantly displayed in records left </l>
            <l n="1.176"> Of persecution, and the Covenant—times </l>
            <l n="1.177"> Whose echo rings through Scotland to this hour! </l>
            <l n="1.178"> And there, by lucky hap, had been preserved </l>
            <l n="1.179"> A straggling volume, torn and incomplete, </l>
            <l n="1.180"> That left half-told the preternatural tale, </l>
            <l n="1.181"> Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends, </l>
            <l n="1.182"> Profuse in garniture of wooden cuts </l>
            <l n="1.183"> Strange and uncouth; dire faces, figures dire, </l>
            <l n="1.184"> Sharp-kneed, sharp-elbowed, and lean-ankled too, </l>
            <l n="1.185"> With long and ghostly shanks—forms which once seen </l>
            <l n="1.186"> Could never be forgotten! </l>
            <l n="1.187">                            In his heart, </l>
            <l n="1.188"> Where Fear sate thus, a cherished visitant, </l>
            <l n="1.189"> Was wanting yet the pure delight of love </l>
            <l n="1.190"> By sound diffused, or by the breathing air, </l>
            <l n="1.191"> Or by the silent looks of happy things, </l>
            <l n="1.192"> Or flowing from the universal face </l>
            <l n="1.193"> Of earth and sky. But he had felt the power </l>
            <l n="1.194"> Of Nature, and already was prepared, </l>
            <l n="1.195"> By his intense conceptions, to receive </l>
            <l n="1.196"> Deeply the lesson deep of love which he, </l>
            <l n="1.197"> Whom Nature, by whatever means, has taught </l>
            <l n="1.198"> To feel intensely, cannot but receive. </l>
            <l n="1.199">   Such was the Boy—but for the growing Youth </l>
            <l n="1.200"> What soul was his, when, from the naked top </l>
            <l n="1.201"> Of some bold headland, he beheld the sun </l>
            <l n="1.202"> Rise up, and bathe the world in light! He looked— </l>
            <l n="1.203"> Ocean and earth, the solid frame of earth </l>
            <l n="1.204"> And ocean's liquid mass, in gladness lay </l>
            <l n="1.205"> Beneath him:—Far and wide the clouds were touched, </l>
            <l n="1.206"> And in their silent faces could he read </l>
            <l n="1.207"> Unutterable love. Sound needed none, </l>
            <l n="1.208"> Nor any voice of joy; his spirit drank </l>
            <l n="1.209"> The spectacle: sensation, soul, and form, </l>
            <l n="1.210"> All melted into him; they swallowed up </l>
            <l n="1.211"> His animal being; in them did he live, </l>
            <l n="1.212"> And by them did he live; they were his life. </l>
            <l n="1.213"> In such access of mind, in such high hour </l>
            <l n="1.214"> Of visitation from the living God, </l>
            <l n="1.215"> Thought was not; in enjoyment it expired. </l>
            <l n="1.216"> No thanks he breathed, he proffered no request; </l>
            <l n="1.217"> Rapt into still communion that transcends </l>
            <l n="1.218"> The imperfect offices of prayer and praise, </l>
            <l n="1.219"> His mind was a thanksgiving to the power </l>
            <l n="1.220"> That made him; it was blessedness and love! </l>
            <l n="1.221">   A Herdsman on the lonely mountain tops, </l>
            <l n="1.222"> Such intercourse was his, and in this sort </l>
            <l n="1.223"> Was his existence oftentimes 'possessed'. </l>
            <l n="1.224"> O then how beautiful, how bright, appeared </l>
            <l n="1.225"> The written promise! Early had he learned </l>
            <l n="1.226"> To reverence the volume that displays </l>
            <l n="1.227"> The mystery, the life which cannot die; </l>
            <l n="1.228"> But in the mountains did he 'feel' his faith. </l>
            <l n="1.229"> All things, responsive to the writing, there </l>
            <l n="1.230"> Breathed immortality, revolving life, </l>
            <l n="1.231"> And greatness still revolving; infinite: </l>
            <l n="1.232"> There littleness was not; the least of things </l>
            <l n="1.233"> Seemed infinite; and there his spirit shaped </l>
            <l n="1.234"> Her prospects, nor did he believe,—he 'saw'. </l>
            <l n="1.235"> What wonder if his being thus became </l>
            <l n="1.236"> Sublime and comprehensive! Low desires, </l>
            <l n="1.237"> Low thoughts had there no place; yet was his heart </l>
            <l n="1.238"> Lowly; for he was meek in gratitude, </l>
            <l n="1.239"> Oft as he called those ecstasies to mind, </l>
            <l n="1.240"> And whence they flowed; and from them he acquired </l>
            <l n="1.241"> Wisdom, which works through patience; thence he learned </l>
            <l n="1.242"> In oft-recurring hours of sober thought </l>
            <l n="1.243"> To look on Nature with a humble heart. </l>
            <l n="1.244"> Self-questioned where it did not understand, </l>
            <l n="1.245"> And with a superstitious eye of love. </l>
            <l n="1.246">   So passed the time; yet to the nearest town </l>
            <l n="1.247"> He duly went with what small overplus </l>
            <l n="1.248"> His earnings might supply, and brought away </l>
            <l n="1.249"> The book that most had tempted his desires </l>
            <l n="1.250"> While at the stall he read. Among the hills </l>
            <l n="1.251"> He gazed upon that mighty orb of song, </l>
            <l n="1.252"> The divine Milton. Lore of different kind, </l>
            <l n="1.253"> The annual savings of a toilsome life, </l>
            <l n="1.254"> His Schoolmaster supplied; books that explain </l>
            <l n="1.255"> The purer elements of truth involved </l>
            <l n="1.256"> In lines and numbers, and, by charm severe, </l>
            <l n="1.257"> (Especially perceived where nature droops </l>
            <l n="1.258"> And feeling is suppressed) preserve the mind </l>
            <l n="1.259"> Busy in solitude and poverty. </l>
            <l n="1.260"> These occupations oftentimes deceived </l>
            <l n="1.261"> The listless hours, while in the hollow vale, </l>
            <l n="1.262"> Hollow and green, he lay on the green turf </l>
            <l n="1.263"> In pensive idleness. What could he do, </l>
            <l n="1.264"> Thus daily thirsting, in that lonesome life, </l>
            <l n="1.265"> With blind endeavours? Yet, still uppermost, </l>
            <l n="1.266"> Nature was at his heart as if he felt, </l>
            <l n="1.267"> Though yet he knew not how, a wasting power </l>
            <l n="1.268"> In all things that from her sweet influence </l>
            <l n="1.269"> Might tend to wean him. Therefore with her hues, </l>
            <l n="1.270"> Her forms, and with the spirit of her forms, </l>
            <l n="1.271"> He clothed the nakedness of austere truth. </l>
            <l n="1.272"> While yet he lingered in the rudiments </l>
            <l n="1.273"> Of science, and among her simplest laws, </l>
            <l n="1.274"> His triangles—they were the stars of heaven, </l>
            <l n="1.275"> The silent stars! Oft did he take delight </l>
            <l n="1.276"> To measure the altitude of some tall crag </l>
            <l n="1.277"> That is the eagle's birth-place, or some peak </l>
            <l n="1.278"> Familiar with forgotten years, that shows, </l>
            <l n="1.279"> Inscribed upon its visionary sides, </l>
            <l n="1.280"> The history of many a winter storm, </l>
            <l n="1.281"> Or obscure records of the path of fire. </l>
            <l n="1.282">   And thus before his eighteenth year was told, </l>
            <l n="1.283"> Accumulated feelings pressed his heart </l>
            <l n="1.284"> With still increasing weight; he was o'er-powered </l>
            <l n="1.285"> By Nature; by the turbulence subdued </l>
            <l n="1.286"> Of his own mind; by mystery and hope, </l>
            <l n="1.287"> And the first virgin passion of a soul </l>
            <l n="1.288"> Communing with the glorious universe. </l>
            <l n="1.289"> Full often wished he that the winds might rage </l>
            <l n="1.290"> When they were silent: far more fondly now </l>
            <l n="1.291"> Than in his earlier season did he love </l>
            <l n="1.292"> Tempestuous nights—the conflict and the sounds </l>
            <l n="1.293"> That live in darkness. From his intellect </l>
            <l n="1.294"> And from the stillness of abstracted thought </l>
            <l n="1.295"> He asked repose; and, failing oft to win </l>
            <l n="1.296"> The peace required, he scanned the laws of light </l>
            <l n="1.297"> Amid the roar of torrents, where they send </l>
            <l n="1.298"> From hollow clefts up to the clearer air </l>
            <l n="1.299"> A cloud of mist that, smitten by the sun, </l>
            <l n="1.300"> Varies its rainbow hues. But vainly thus, </l>
            <l n="1.301"> And vainly by all other means, he strove </l>
            <l n="1.302"> To mitigate the fever of his heart. </l>
            <l n="1.303">   In dreams, in study, and in ardent thought, </l>
            <l n="1.304"> Thus was he reared; much wanting to assist </l>
            <l n="1.305"> The growth of intellect, yet gaining more, </l>
            <l n="1.306"> And every moral feeling of his soul </l>
            <l n="1.307"> Strengthened and braced, by breathing in content </l>
            <l n="1.308"> The keen, the wholesome, air of poverty, </l>
            <l n="1.309"> And drinking from the well of homely life. </l>
            <l n="1.310"> —But, from past liberty, and tried restraints, </l>
            <l n="1.311"> He now was summoned to select the course </l>
            <l n="1.312"> Of humble industry that promised best </l>
            <l n="1.313"> To yield him no unworthy maintenance. </l>
            <l n="1.314"> Urged by his Mother, he essayed to teach </l>
            <l n="1.315"> A village-school—but wandering thoughts were then </l>
            <l n="1.316"> A misery to him; and the Youth resigned </l>
            <l n="1.317"> A task he was unable to perform. </l>
            <l n="1.318">   That stern yet kindly Spirit, who constrains </l>
            <l n="1.319"> The Savoyard to quit his naked rocks, </l>
            <l n="1.320"> The free-born Swiss to leave his narrow vales, </l>
            <l n="1.321"> (Spirit attached to regions mountainous </l>
            <l n="1.322"> Like their own stedfast clouds) did now impel </l>
            <l n="1.323"> His restless mind to look abroad with hope. </l>
            <l n="1.324"> —An irksome drudgery seems it to plod on, </l>
            <l n="1.325"> Through hot and dusty ways, or pelting storm, </l>
            <l n="1.326"> A vagrant Merchant under a heavy load, </l>
            <l n="1.327"> Bent as he moves, and needing frequent rest; </l>
            <l n="1.328"> Yet do such travellers find their own delight; </l>
            <l n="1.329"> And their hard service, deemed debasing now </l>
            <l n="1.330"> Gained merited respect in simpler times; </l>
            <l n="1.331"> When squire, and priest, and they who round them dwelt </l>
            <l n="1.332"> In rustic sequestration—all dependent </l>
            <l n="1.333"> Upon the PEDLAR'S toil—supplied their wants, </l>
            <l n="1.334"> Or pleased their fancies, with the wares he brought. </l>
            <l n="1.335"> Not ignorant was the Youth that still no few </l>
            <l n="1.336"> Of his adventurous countrymen were led </l>
            <l n="1.337"> By perseverance in this track of life </l>
            <l n="1.338"> To competence and ease:—to him it offered </l>
            <l n="1.339"> Attractions manifold;—and this he chose. </l>
            <l n="1.340"> —His Parents on the enterprise bestowed </l>
            <l n="1.341"> Their farewell benediction, but with hearts </l>
            <l n="1.342"> Foreboding evil. From his native hills </l>
            <l n="1.343"> He wandered far; much did he see of men, </l>
            <l n="1.344"> Their manners, their enjoyments, and pursuits, </l>
            <l n="1.345"> Their passions and their feelings; chiefly those </l>
            <l n="1.346"> Essential and eternal in the heart, </l>
            <l n="1.347"> That, 'mid the simpler forms of rural life, </l>
            <l n="1.348"> Exist more simple in their elements, </l>
            <l n="1.349"> And speak a plainer language. In the woods, </l>
            <l n="1.350"> A lone Enthusiast, and among the fields, </l>
            <l n="1.351"> Itinerant in this labour, he had passed </l>
            <l n="1.352"> The better portion of his time; and there </l>
            <l n="1.353"> Spontaneously had his affections thriven </l>
            <l n="1.354"> Amid the bounties of the year, the peace </l>
            <l n="1.355"> And liberty of nature; there he kept </l>
            <l n="1.356"> In solitude and solitary thought </l>
            <l n="1.357"> His mind in a just equipoise of love. </l>
            <l n="1.358"> Serene it was, unclouded by the cares </l>
            <l n="1.359"> Of ordinary life; unvexed, unwarped </l>
            <l n="1.360"> By partial bondage. In his steady course, </l>
            <l n="1.361"> No piteous revolutions had he felt, </l>
            <l n="1.362"> No wild varieties of joy and grief. </l>
            <l n="1.363"> Unoccupied by sorrow of its own, </l>
            <l n="1.364"> His heart lay open; and, by nature tuned </l>
            <l n="1.365"> And constant disposition of his thoughts </l>
            <l n="1.366"> To sympathy with man, he was alive </l>
            <l n="1.367"> To all that was enjoyed where'er he went, </l>
            <l n="1.368"> And all that was endured; for, in himself </l>
            <l n="1.369"> Happy, and quiet in his cheerfulness, </l>
            <l n="1.370"> He had no painful pressure from without </l>
            <l n="1.371"> That made him turn aside from wretchedness </l>
            <l n="1.372"> With coward fears. He could 'afford' to suffer </l>
            <l n="1.373"> With those whom he saw suffer. Hence it came </l>
            <l n="1.374"> That in our best experience he was rich, </l>
            <l n="1.375"> And in the wisdom of our daily life. </l>
            <l n="1.376"> For hence, minutely, in his various rounds, </l>
            <l n="1.377"> He had observed the progress and decay </l>
            <l n="1.378"> Of many minds, of minds and bodies too; </l>
            <l n="1.379"> The history of many families; </l>
            <l n="1.380"> How they had prospered; how they were o'erthrown </l>
            <l n="1.381"> By passion or mischance, or such misrule </l>
            <l n="1.382"> Among the unthinking masters of the earth </l>
            <l n="1.383"> As makes the nations groan. </l>
            <l n="1.384">                              This active course </l>
            <l n="1.385"> He followed till provision for his wants </l>
            <l n="1.386"> Had been obtained;—the Wanderer then resolved </l>
            <l n="1.387"> To pass the remnant of his days, untasked </l>
            <l n="1.388"> With needless services, from hardship free. </l>
            <l n="1.389"> His calling laid aside, he lived at ease: </l>
            <l n="1.390"> But still he loved to pace the public roads </l>
            <l n="1.391"> And the wild paths; and, by the summer's warmth </l>
            <l n="1.392"> Invited, often would he leave his home </l>
            <l n="1.393"> And journey far, revisiting the scenes </l>
            <l n="1.394"> That to his memory were most endeared. </l>
            <l n="1.395"> —Vigorous in health, of hopeful spirits, undamped </l>
            <l n="1.396"> By worldly-mindedness or anxious care; </l>
            <l n="1.397"> Observant, studious, thoughtful, and refreshed </l>
            <l n="1.398"> By knowledge gathered up from day to day; </l>
            <l n="1.399"> Thus had he lived a long and innocent life. </l>
            <l n="1.400">   The Scottish Church, both on himself and those </l>
            <l n="1.401"> With whom from childhood he grew up, had held </l>
            <l n="1.402"> The strong hand of her purity; and still </l>
            <l n="1.403"> Had watched him with an unrelenting eye. </l>
            <l n="1.404"> This he remembered in his riper age </l>
            <l n="1.405"> With gratitude, and reverential thoughts. </l>
            <l n="1.406"> But by the native vigour of his mind, </l>
            <l n="1.407"> By his habitual wanderings out of doors, </l>
            <l n="1.408"> By loneliness, and goodness, and kind works, </l>
            <l n="1.409"> Whate'er, in docile childhood or in youth, </l>
            <l n="1.410"> He had imbibed of fear or darker thought </l>
            <l n="1.411"> Was melted all away; so true was this, </l>
            <l n="1.412"> That sometimes his religion seemed to me </l>
            <l n="1.413"> Self-taught, as of a dreamer in the woods; </l>
            <l n="1.414"> Who to the model of his own pure heart </l>
            <l n="1.415"> Shaped his belief, as grace divine inspired, </l>
            <l n="1.416"> And human reason dictated with awe. </l>
            <l n="1.417"> —And surely never did there live on earth </l>
            <l n="1.418"> A man of kindlier nature. The rough sports </l>
            <l n="1.419"> And teasing ways of children vexed not him; </l>
            <l n="1.420"> Indulgent listener was he to the tongue </l>
            <l n="1.421"> Of garrulous age; nor did the sick man's tale, </l>
            <l n="1.422"> To his fraternal sympathy addressed, </l>

            <l n="1.424">                            Plain his garb; </l>
            <l n="1.425"> Such as might suit a rustic Sire, prepared </l>
            <l n="1.426"> For sabbath duties; yet he was a man </l>
            <l n="1.427"> Whom no one could have passed without remark. </l>
            <l n="1.428"> Active and nervous was his gait; his limbs </l>
            <l n="1.429"> And his whole figure breathed intelligence. </l>
            <l n="1.430"> Time had compressed the freshness of his cheek </l>
            <l n="1.431"> Into a narrower circle of deep red, </l>
            <l n="1.432"> But had not tamed his eye; that, under brows </l>
            <l n="1.433"> Shaggy and grey, had meanings which it brought </l>
            <l n="1.434"> From years of youth; which, like a Being made </l>
            <l n="1.435"> Of many Beings, he had wondrous skill </l>
            <l n="1.436"> To blend with knowledge of the years to come, </l>
            <l n="1.437"> Human, or such as lie beyond the grave. </l>

            <l n="1.439">   So was He framed; and such his course of life </l>
            <l n="1.440"> Who now, with no appendage but a staff, </l>
            <l n="1.441"> The prized memorial of relinquished toils, </l>
            <l n="1.442"> Upon that cottage-bench reposed his limbs, </l>
            <l n="1.443"> Screened from the sun. Supine the Wanderer lay, </l>
            <l n="1.444"> His eyes as if in drowsiness half shut, </l>
            <l n="1.445"> The shadows of the breezy elms above </l>
            <l n="1.446"> Dappling his face. He had not heard the sound </l>
            <l n="1.447"> Of my approaching steps, and in the shade </l>
            <l n="1.448"> Unnoticed did I stand some minutes' space. </l>
            <l n="1.449"> At length I hailed him, seeing that his hat </l>
            <l n="1.450"> Was moist with water-drops, as if the brim </l>
            <l n="1.451"> Had newly scooped a running stream. He rose, </l>
            <l n="1.452"> And ere our lively greeting into peace </l>
            <l n="1.453"> Had settled, “'Tis,” said I, “a burning day: </l>
            <l n="1.454"> My lips are parched with thirst, but you, it seems </l>

            <l n="1.456"> Pointing towards a sweet-briar, bade me climb </l>
            <l n="1.457"> The fence where that aspiring shrub looked out </l>
            <l n="1.458"> Upon the public way. It was a plot </l>
            <l n="1.459"> Of garden ground run wild, its matted weeds </l>
            <l n="1.460"> Marked with the steps of those, whom, as they passed, </l>
            <l n="1.461"> The gooseberry trees that shot in long lank slips, </l>
            <l n="1.462"> Or currants, hanging from their leafless stems, </l>
            <l n="1.463"> In scanty strings, had tempted to o'erleap </l>
            <l n="1.464"> The broken wall. I looked around, and there, </l>
            <l n="1.465"> Where two tall hedge-rows of thick alder boughs </l>
            <l n="1.466"> Joined in a cold damp nook, espied a well </l>
            <l n="1.467"> Shrouded with willow-flowers and plumy fern. </l>
            <l n="1.468"> My thirst I slaked, and, from the cheerless spot </l>
            <l n="1.469"> Withdrawing, straightway to the shade returned </l>
            <l n="1.470"> Where sate the old Man on the cottage-bench; </l>
            <l n="1.471"> And, while, beside him, with uncovered head, </l>
            <l n="1.472"> I yet was standing, freely to respire, </l>
            <l n="1.473"> And cool my temples in the fanning air, </l>
            <l n="1.474"> Thus did he speak. “I see around me here </l>

            <l n="1.481"> Lamenting the departed, call the groves, </l>
            <l n="1.482"> They call upon the hills and streams, to mourn, </l>
            <l n="1.483"> And senseless rocks; nor idly; for they speak, </l>
            <l n="1.484"> In these their invocations, with a voice </l>

            <l n="1.494"> Dislodged the natural sleep that binds them up </l>

            <l n="1.502"> Forgive them;—never—never did my steps </l>
            <l n="1.503"> Approach this door but she who dwelt within </l>
            <l n="1.504"> A daughter's welcome gave me, and I loved her </l>

            <l n="1.517"> Of virtues bloomed beneath this lonely roof. </l>
            <l n="1.518"> She was a Woman of a steady mind, </l>
            <l n="1.519"> Tender and deep in her excess of love; </l>
            <l n="1.520"> Not speaking much, pleased rather with the joy </l>
            <l n="1.521"> Of her own thoughts: by some especial care </l>
            <l n="1.522"> Her temper had been framed, as if to make </l>
            <l n="1.523"> A Being, who by adding love to peace </l>
            <l n="1.524"> Might live on earth a life of happiness. </l>
            <l n="1.525"> Her wedded Partner lacked not on his side </l>
            <l n="1.526"> The humble worth that satisfied her heart: </l>
            <l n="1.527"> Frugal, affectionate, sober, and withal </l>
            <l n="1.528"> Keenly industrious. She with pride would tell </l>
            <l n="1.529"> That he was often seated at his loom, </l>
            <l n="1.530"> In summer, ere the mower was abroad </l>
            <l n="1.531"> Among the dewy grass,—in early spring, </l>
            <l n="1.532"> Ere the last star had vanished.—They who passed </l>
            <l n="1.533"> At evening, from behind the garden fence </l>
            <l n="1.534"> Might hear his busy spade, which he would ply, </l>
            <l n="1.535"> After his daily work, until the light </l>
            <l n="1.536"> Had failed, and every leaf and flower were lost </l>
            <l n="1.537"> In the dark hedges. So their days were spent </l>
            <l n="1.538"> In peace and comfort; and a pretty boy </l>
            <l n="1.539"> Was their best hope, next to the God in heaven. </l>
            <l n="1.540">   Not twenty years ago, but you I think </l>
            <l n="1.541"> Can scarcely bear it now in mind, there came </l>
            <l n="1.542"> Two blighting seasons, when the fields were left </l>
            <l n="1.543"> With half a harvest. It pleased Heaven to add </l>
            <l n="1.544"> A worse affliction in the plague of war: </l>
            <l n="1.545"> This happy Land was stricken to the heart! </l>
            <l n="1.546"> A Wanderer then among the cottages, </l>
            <l n="1.547"> I, with my freight of winter raiment, saw </l>
            <l n="1.548"> The hardships of that season: many rich </l>
            <l n="1.549"> Sank down, as in a dream, among the poor; </l>
            <l n="1.550"> And of the poor did many cease to be, </l>
            <l n="1.551"> And their place knew them not. Meanwhile, abridged </l>
            <l n="1.552"> Of daily comforts, gladly reconciled </l>
            <l n="1.553"> To numerous self-denials, Margaret </l>
            <l n="1.554"> Went struggling on through those calamitous years </l>
            <l n="1.555"> With cheerful hope, until the second autumn, </l>
            <l n="1.556"> When her life's Helpmate on a sick-bed lay, </l>
            <l n="1.557"> Smitten with perilous fever. In disease </l>
            <l n="1.558"> He lingered long; and, when his strength returned, </l>
            <l n="1.559"> He found the little he had stored, to meet </l>
            <l n="1.560"> The hour of accident or crippling age, </l>
            <l n="1.561"> Was all consumed. A second infant now </l>
            <l n="1.562"> Was added to the troubles of a time </l>
            <l n="1.563"> Laden, for them and all of their degree, </l>
            <l n="1.564"> With care and sorrow; shoals of artisans </l>
            <l n="1.565"> From ill-requited labour turned adrift </l>
            <l n="1.566"> Sought daily bread from public charity, </l>
            <l n="1.567"> They, and their wives and children—happier far </l>
            <l n="1.568"> Could they have lived as do the little birds </l>
            <l n="1.569"> That peck along the hedge-rows, or the kite </l>
            <l n="1.570"> That makes her dwelling on the mountain rocks! </l>
            <l n="1.571">   A sad reverse it was for him who long </l>
            <l n="1.572"> Had filled with plenty, and possessed in peace, </l>
            <l n="1.573"> This lonely Cottage. At the door he stood, </l>
            <l n="1.574"> And whistled many a snatch of merry tunes </l>
            <l n="1.575"> That had no mirth in them; or with his knife </l>
            <l n="1.576"> Carved uncouth figures on the heads of sticks— </l>
            <l n="1.577"> Then, not less idly, sought, through every nook </l>
            <l n="1.578"> In house or garden, any casual work </l>
            <l n="1.579"> Of use or ornament; and with a strange, </l>
            <l n="1.580"> Amusing, yet uneasy, novelty, </l>
            <l n="1.581"> He mingled, where he might, the various tasks </l>
            <l n="1.582"> Of summer, autumn, winter, and of spring. </l>
            <l n="1.583"> But this endured not; his good humour soon </l>
            <l n="1.584"> Became a weight in which no pleasure was: </l>
            <l n="1.585"> And poverty brought on a petted mood </l>
            <l n="1.586"> And a sore temper: day by day he drooped, </l>
            <l n="1.587"> And he would leave his work—and to the town </l>
            <l n="1.588"> Would turn without an errand his slack steps; </l>
            <l n="1.589"> Or wander here and there among the fields. </l>
            <l n="1.590"> One while he would speak lightly of his babes, </l>
            <l n="1.591"> And with a cruel tongue: at other times </l>
            <l n="1.592"> He tossed them with a false unnatural joy: </l>
            <l n="1.593"> And 'twas a rueful thing to see the looks </l>
            <l n="1.594"> Of the poor innocent children. 'Every smile,' </l>
            <l n="1.595"> Said Margaret to me, here beneath these trees, </l>
            <l n="1.596"> 'Made my heart bleed.'” </l>
            <l n="1.597">                          At this the Wanderer paused; </l>
            <l n="1.598"> And, looking up to those enormous elms, </l>
            <l n="1.599"> He said, “'Tis now the hour of deepest noon. </l>
            <l n="1.600"> At this still season of repose and peace, </l>
            <l n="1.601"> This hour when all things which are not at rest </l>
            <l n="1.602"> Are cheerful; while this multitude of flies </l>
            <l n="1.603"> With tuneful hum is filling all the air; </l>
            <l n="1.604"> Why should a tear be on an old Man's cheek? </l>
            <l n="1.605"> Why should we thus, with an untoward mind, </l>
            <l n="1.606"> And in the weakness of humanity, </l>
            <l n="1.607"> From natural wisdom turn our hearts away; </l>
            <l n="1.608"> To natural comfort shut our eyes and ears; </l>
            <l n="1.609"> And, feeding on disquiet, thus disturb </l>
            <l n="1.610"> The calm of nature with our restless thoughts?” </l>
            <l n="1.611">                    _____________ </l>
            <l n="1.612"> HE spake with somewhat of a solemn tone: </l>
            <l n="1.613"> But, when he ended, there was in his face </l>
            <l n="1.614"> Such easy cheerfulness, a look so mild, </l>
            <l n="1.615"> That for a little time it stole away </l>
            <l n="1.616"> All recollection; and that simple tale </l>
            <l n="1.617"> Passed from my mind like a forgotten sound. </l>
            <l n="1.618"> A while on trivial things we held discourse, </l>
            <l n="1.619"> To me soon tasteless. In my own despite, </l>
            <l n="1.620"> I thought of that poor Woman as of one </l>
            <l n="1.621"> Whom I had known and loved. He had rehearsed </l>
            <l n="1.622"> Her homely tale with such familiar power, </l>
            <l n="1.623"> With such an active countenance, an eye </l>
            <l n="1.624"> So busy, that the things of which he spake </l>
            <l n="1.625"> Seemed present; and, attention now relaxed, </l>
            <l n="1.626"> A heart-felt chillness crept along my veins. </l>
            <l n="1.627"> I rose; and, having left the breezy shade, </l>
            <l n="1.628"> Stood drinking comfort from the warmer sun, </l>
            <l n="1.629"> That had not cheered me long—ere, looking round </l>
            <l n="1.630"> Upon that tranquil Ruin, I returned, </l>
            <l n="1.631"> And begged of the old Man that, for my sake, </l>
            <l n="1.632"> He would resume his story. </l>
            <l n="1.633">                             He replied, </l>
            <l n="1.634"> “It were a wantonness, and would demand </l>
            <l n="1.635"> Severe reproof, if we were men whose hearts </l>
            <l n="1.636"> Could hold vain dalliance with the misery </l>
            <l n="1.637"> Even of the dead; contented thence to draw </l>
            <l n="1.638"> A momentary pleasure, never marked </l>
            <l n="1.639"> By reason, barren of all future good. </l>
            <l n="1.640"> But we have known that there is often found </l>
            <l n="1.641"> In mournful thoughts, and always might be found, </l>
            <l n="1.642"> A power to virtue friendly; were't not so, </l>
            <l n="1.643"> I am a dreamer among men, indeed </l>
            <l n="1.644"> An idle dreamer! 'Tis a common tale, </l>
            <l n="1.645"> An ordinary sorrow of man's life, </l>
            <l n="1.646"> A tale of silent suffering, hardly clothed </l>
            <l n="1.647"> In bodily form.—But without further bidding </l>
            <l n="1.648"> I will proceed. </l>
            <l n="1.649">                  While thus it fared with them, </l>
            <l n="1.650"> To whom this cottage, till those hapless years, </l>
            <l n="1.651"> Had been a blessed home, it was my chance </l>
            <l n="1.652"> To travel in a country far remote; </l>
            <l n="1.653"> And when these lofty elms once more appeared </l>
            <l n="1.654"> What pleasant expectations lured me on </l>
            <l n="1.655"> O'er the flat Common!—With quick step I reached </l>
            <l n="1.656"> The threshold, lifted with light hand the latch; </l>
            <l n="1.657"> But, when I entered, Margaret looked at me </l>
            <l n="1.658"> A little while; then turned her head away </l>
            <l n="1.659"> Speechless,—and, sitting down upon a chair, </l>
            <l n="1.660"> Wept bitterly. I wist not what to do, </l>
            <l n="1.661"> Nor how to speak to her. Poor Wretch! at last </l>
            <l n="1.662"> She rose from off her seat, and then,—O Sir! </l>
            <l n="1.663"> I cannot 'tell' how she pronounced my name:— </l>
            <l n="1.664"> With fervent love, and with a face of grief </l>
            <l n="1.665"> Unutterably helpless, and a look </l>
            <l n="1.666"> That seemed to cling upon me, she enquired </l>
            <l n="1.667"> If I had seen her husband. As she spake </l>
            <l n="1.668"> A strange surprise and fear came to my heart, </l>
            <l n="1.669"> Nor had I power to answer ere she told </l>
            <l n="1.670"> That he had disappeared—not two months gone. </l>
            <l n="1.671"> He left his house: two wretched days had past, </l>
            <l n="1.672"> And on the third, as wistfully she raised </l>
            <l n="1.673"> Her head from off her pillow, to look forth, </l>
            <l n="1.674"> Like one in trouble, for returning light, </l>
            <l n="1.675"> Within her chamber-casement she espied </l>
            <l n="1.676"> A folded paper, lying as if placed </l>
            <l n="1.677"> To meet her waking eyes. This tremblingly </l>
            <l n="1.678"> She opened—found no writing, but beheld </l>
            <l n="1.679"> Pieces of money carefully enclosed, </l>
            <l n="1.680"> Silver and gold. 'I shuddered at the sight,' </l>
            <l n="1.681"> Said Margaret, 'for I knew it was his hand </l>
            <l n="1.682"> That must have placed it there; and ere that day </l>
            <l n="1.683"> Was ended, that long anxious day, I learned, </l>
            <l n="1.684"> From one who by my husband had been sent </l>
            <l n="1.685"> With the sad news, that he had joined a troop </l>
            <l n="1.686"> Of soldiers, going to a distant land. </l>
            <l n="1.687"> —He left me thus—he could not gather heart </l>
            <l n="1.688"> To take a farewell of me; for he feared </l>
            <l n="1.689"> That I should follow with my babes, and sink </l>
            <l n="1.690"> Beneath the misery of that wandering life.' </l>
            <l n="1.691">   This tale did Margaret tell with many tears: </l>
            <l n="1.692"> And, when she ended, I had little power </l>
            <l n="1.693"> To give her comfort, and was glad to take </l>
            <l n="1.694"> Such words of hope from her own mouth as served </l>
            <l n="1.695"> To cheer us both. But long we had not talked </l>
            <l n="1.696"> Ere we built up a pile of better thoughts, </l>
            <l n="1.697"> And with a brighter eye she looked around </l>
            <l n="1.698"> As if she had been shedding tears of joy. </l>
            <l n="1.699"> We parted.—'Twas the time of early spring; </l>
            <l n="1.700"> I left her busy with her garden tools; </l>
            <l n="1.701"> And well remember, o'er that fence she looked, </l>
            <l n="1.702"> And, while I paced along the foot-way path, </l>
            <l n="1.703"> Called out, and sent a blessing after me, </l>
            <l n="1.704"> With tender cheerfulness, and with a voice </l>
            <l n="1.705"> That seemed the very sound of happy thoughts. </l>
            <l n="1.706">   I roved o'er many a hill and many a dale, </l>
            <l n="1.707"> With my accustomed load; in heat and cold, </l>
            <l n="1.708"> Through many a wood and many an open ground, </l>
            <l n="1.709"> In sunshine and in shade, in wet and fair, </l>
            <l n="1.710"> Drooping or blithe of heart, as might befall; </l>
            <l n="1.711"> My best companions now the driving winds, </l>
            <l n="1.712"> And now the 'trotting brooks' and whispering trees, </l>
            <l n="1.713"> And now the music of my own sad steps, </l>
            <l n="1.714"> With many a short-lived thought that passed between, </l>
            <l n="1.715"> And disappeared. </l>
            <l n="1.716">                   I journeyed back this way, </l>
            <l n="1.717"> When, in the warmth of midsummer, the wheat </l>
            <l n="1.718"> Was yellow; and the soft and bladed grass, </l>
            <l n="1.719"> Springing afresh, had o'er the hay-field spread </l>
            <l n="1.720"> Its tender verdure. At the door arrived, </l>
            <l n="1.721"> I found that she was absent. In the shade, </l>
            <l n="1.722"> Where now we sit, I waited her return. </l>
            <l n="1.723"> Her cottage, then a cheerful object, wore </l>
            <l n="1.724"> Its customary look,—only, it seemed, </l>
            <l n="1.725"> The honeysuckle, crowding round the porch, </l>
            <l n="1.726"> Hung down in heavier tufts; and that bright weed, </l>
            <l n="1.727"> The yellow stone-crop, suffered to take root </l>
            <l n="1.728"> Along the window's edge, profusely grew, </l>
            <l n="1.729"> Blinding the lower panes. I turned aside, </l>
            <l n="1.730"> And strolled into her garden. It appeared </l>
            <l n="1.731"> To lag behind the season, and had lost </l>
            <l n="1.732"> Its pride of neatness. Daisy-flowers and thrift </l>
            <l n="1.733"> Had broken their trim border-lines, and straggled </l>
            <l n="1.734"> O'er paths they used to deck: carnations, once </l>
            <l n="1.735"> Prized for surpassing beauty, and no less </l>
            <l n="1.736"> For the peculiar pains they had required, </l>
            <l n="1.737"> Declined their languid heads, wanting support. </l>
            <l n="1.738"> The cumbrous bind-weed, with its wreaths and bells, </l>
            <l n="1.739"> Had twined about her two small rows of peas, </l>
            <l n="1.740"> And dragged them to the earth. </l>
            <l n="1.741">                                 Ere this an hour </l>
            <l n="1.742"> Was wasted.—Back I turned my restless steps; </l>
            <l n="1.743"> A stranger passed; and, guessing whom I sought, </l>
            <l n="1.744"> He said that she was used to ramble far.— </l>
            <l n="1.745"> The sun was sinking in the west; and now </l>
            <l n="1.746"> I sate with sad impatience. From within </l>
            <l n="1.747"> Her solitary infant cried aloud; </l>
            <l n="1.748"> Then, like a blast that dies away self-stilled, </l>
            <l n="1.749"> The voice was silent. From the bench I rose; </l>
            <l n="1.750"> But neither could divert nor soothe my thoughts. </l>
            <l n="1.751"> The spot, though fair, was very desolate— </l>
            <l n="1.752"> The longer I remained, more desolate: </l>
            <l n="1.753"> And, looking round me, now I first observed </l>
            <l n="1.754"> The corner stones, on either side the porch, </l>
            <l n="1.755"> With dull red stains discoloured, and stuck o'er </l>
            <l n="1.756"> With tufts and hairs of wool, as if the sheep, </l>
            <l n="1.757"> That fed upon the Common, thither came </l>
            <l n="1.758"> Familiarly, and found a couching-place </l>
            <l n="1.759"> Even at her threshold. Deeper shadows fell </l>
            <l n="1.760"> From these tall elms; the cottage-clock struck eight;— </l>
            <l n="1.761"> I turned, and saw her distant a few steps. </l>
            <l n="1.762"> Her face was pale and thin—her figure, too, </l>
            <l n="1.763"> Was changed. As she unlocked the door, she said, </l>
            <l n="1.764"> 'It grieves me you have waited here so long, </l>
            <l n="1.765"> But, in good truth, I've wandered much of late; </l>
            <l n="1.766"> And sometimes—to my shame I speak—have need </l>
            <l n="1.767"> Of my best prayers to bring me back again. </l>
            <l n="1.768"> While on the board she spread our evening meal, </l>
            <l n="1.769"> She told me—interrupting not the work </l>
            <l n="1.770"> Which gave employment to her listless hands— </l>
            <l n="1.771"> That she had parted with her elder child; </l>
            <l n="1.772"> To a kind master on a distant farm </l>
            <l n="1.773"> Now happily apprenticed.—'I perceive </l>
            <l n="1.774"> You look at me, and you have cause; today </l>
            <l n="1.775"> I have been travelling far; and many days </l>
            <l n="1.776"> About the fields I wander, knowing this </l>
            <l n="1.777"> Only, that what I seek I cannot find; </l>
            <l n="1.778"> And so I waste my time: for I am changed; </l>
            <l n="1.779"> And to myself,' said she, 'have done much wrong </l>
            <l n="1.780"> And to this helpless infant. I have slept </l>
            <l n="1.781"> Weeping, and weeping have I waked; my tears </l>
            <l n="1.782"> Have flowed as if my body were not such </l>
            <l n="1.783"> As others are; and I could never die. </l>
            <l n="1.784"> But I am now in mind and in my heart </l>
            <l n="1.785"> More easy; and I hope,' said she, 'that God </l>
            <l n="1.786"> Will give me patience to endure the things </l>
            <l n="1.787"> Which I behold at home.' </l>
            <l n="1.788">                           It would have grieved </l>
            <l n="1.789"> Your very soul to see her. Sir, I feel </l>
            <l n="1.790"> The story linger in my heart; I fear </l>
            <l n="1.791"> 'Tis long and tedious; but my spirit clings </l>
            <l n="1.792"> To that poor Woman:—so familiarly </l>
            <l n="1.793"> Do I perceive her manner, and her look, </l>
            <l n="1.794"> And presence; and so deeply do I feel </l>
            <l n="1.795"> Her goodness, that, not seldom, in my walks </l>
            <l n="1.796"> A momentary trance comes over me; </l>
            <l n="1.797"> And to myself I seem to muse on One </l>
            <l n="1.798"> By sorrow laid asleep; or borne away, </l>
            <l n="1.799"> A human being destined to awake </l>
            <l n="1.800"> To human life, or something very near </l>
            <l n="1.801"> To human life, when he shall come again </l>
            <l n="1.802"> For whom she suffered. Yes, it would have grieved </l>
            <l n="1.803"> Your very soul to see her: evermore </l>
            <l n="1.804"> Her eyelids drooped, her eyes downward were cast; </l>
            <l n="1.805"> And, when she at her table gave me food, </l>
            <l n="1.806"> She did not look at me. Her voice was low, </l>
            <l n="1.807"> Her body was subdued. In every act </l>
            <l n="1.808"> Pertaining to her house-affairs, appeared </l>
            <l n="1.809"> The careless stillness of a thinking mind </l>
            <l n="1.810"> Self-occupied; to which all outward things </l>
            <l n="1.811"> Are like an idle matter. Still she sighed, </l>
            <l n="1.812"> But yet no motion of the breast was seen, </l>
            <l n="1.813"> No heaving of the heart. While by the fire </l>
            <l n="1.814"> We sate together, sighs came on my ear, </l>
            <l n="1.815"> I knew not how, and hardly whence they came. </l>
            <l n="1.816">   Ere my departure, to her care I gave, </l>
            <l n="1.817"> For her son's use, some tokens of regard, </l>
            <l n="1.818"> Which with a look of welcome she received; </l>
            <l n="1.819"> And I exhorted her to place her trust </l>
            <l n="1.820"> In God's good love, and seek his help by prayer. </l>
            <l n="1.821"> I took my staff, and, when I kissed her babe, </l>
            <l n="1.822"> The tears stood in her eyes. I left her then </l>
            <l n="1.823"> With the best hope and comfort I could give: </l>
            <l n="1.824"> She thanked me for my wish;—but for my hope </l>
            <l n="1.825"> It seemed she did not thank me. </l>
            <l n="1.826">                                  I returned, </l>
            <l n="1.827"> And took my rounds along this road again </l>
            <l n="1.828"> When on its sunny bank the primrose flower </l>
            <l n="1.829"> Peeped forth, to give an earnest of the Spring. </l>
            <l n="1.830"> I found her sad and drooping: she had learned </l>
            <l n="1.831"> No tidings of her husband; if he lived, </l>
            <l n="1.832"> She knew not that he lived; if he were dead, </l>
            <l n="1.833"> She knew not he was dead. She seemed the same </l>
            <l n="1.834"> In person and appearance; but her house </l>
            <l n="1.835"> Bespake a sleepy hand of negligence; </l>
            <l n="1.836"> The floor was neither dry nor neat, the hearth </l>
            <l n="1.837"> Was comfortless, and her small lot of books, </l>
            <l n="1.838"> Which, in the cottage-window, heretofore </l>
            <l n="1.839"> Had been piled up against the corner panes </l>
            <l n="1.840"> In seemly order, now, with straggling leaves </l>
            <l n="1.841"> Lay scattered here and there, open or shut, </l>
            <l n="1.842"> As they had chanced to fall. Her infant Babe </l>
            <l n="1.843"> Had from his Mother caught the trick of grief, </l>
            <l n="1.844"> And sighed among its playthings. I withdrew, </l>
            <l n="1.845"> And once again entering the garden saw, </l>
            <l n="1.846"> More plainly still, that poverty and grief </l>
            <l n="1.847"> Were now come nearer to her: weeds defaced </l>
            <l n="1.848"> The hardened soil, and knots of withered grass: </l>
            <l n="1.849"> No ridges there appeared of clear black mould, </l>
            <l n="1.850"> No winter greenness; of her herbs and flowers, </l>
            <l n="1.851"> It seemed the better part was gnawed away </l>
            <l n="1.852"> Or trampled into earth; a chain of straw, </l>
            <l n="1.853"> Which had been twined about the slender stem </l>
            <l n="1.854"> Of a young apple-tree, lay at its root; </l>
            <l n="1.855"> The bark was nibbled round by truant sheep. </l>
            <l n="1.856"> —Margaret stood near, her infant in her arms, </l>
            <l n="1.857"> And, noting that my eye was on the tree, </l>
            <l n="1.858"> She said, 'I fear it will be dead and gone </l>
            <l n="1.859"> Ere Robert come again.' When to the House </l>
            <l n="1.860"> We had returned together, she enquired </l>
            <l n="1.861"> If I had any hope:—but for her babe </l>
            <l n="1.862"> And for her little orphan boy, she said, </l>
            <l n="1.863"> She had no wish to live, that she must die </l>
            <l n="1.864"> Of sorrow. Yet I saw the idle loom </l>
            <l n="1.865"> Still in its place; his Sunday garments hung </l>
            <l n="1.866"> Upon the self-same nail; his very staff </l>
            <l n="1.867"> Stood undisturbed behind the door. </l>
            <l n="1.868">                                     And when, </l>
            <l n="1.869"> In bleak December, I retraced this way, </l>
            <l n="1.870"> She told me that her little babe was dead, </l>
            <l n="1.871"> And she was left alone. She now, released </l>
            <l n="1.872"> From her maternal cares, had taken up </l>
            <l n="1.873"> The employment common through these wilds, and gained, </l>
            <l n="1.874"> By spinning hemp, a pittance for herself; </l>
            <l n="1.875"> And for this end had hired a neighbour's boy </l>
            <l n="1.876"> To give her needful help. That very time </l>
            <l n="1.877"> Most willingly she put her work aside, </l>
            <l n="1.878"> And walked with me along the miry road, </l>
            <l n="1.879"> Heedless how far; and, in such piteous sort </l>
            <l n="1.880"> That any heart had ached to hear her, begged </l>
            <l n="1.881"> That, wheresoe'er I went, I still would ask </l>
            <l n="1.882"> For him whom she had lost. We parted then— </l>
            <l n="1.883"> Our final parting; for from that time forth </l>
            <l n="1.884"> Did many seasons pass ere I returned </l>
            <l n="1.885"> Into this tract again. </l>
            <l n="1.886">                         Nine tedious years; </l>
            <l n="1.887"> From their first separation, nine long years, </l>
            <l n="1.888"> She lingered in unquiet widowhood; </l>
            <l n="1.889"> A Wife and Widow. Needs must it have been </l>
            <l n="1.890"> A sore heart-wasting! I have heard, my Friend, </l>
            <l n="1.891"> That in yon arbour oftentimes she sate </l>
            <l n="1.892"> Alone, through half the vacant sabbath day; </l>
            <l n="1.893"> And, if a dog passed by, she still would quit </l>
            <l n="1.894"> The shade, and look abroad. On this old bench </l>
            <l n="1.895"> For hours she sate; and evermore her eye </l>
            <l n="1.896"> Was busy in the distance, shaping things </l>
            <l n="1.897"> That made her heart beat quick. You see that path, </l>
            <l n="1.898"> Now faint,—the grass has crept o'er its grey line; </l>
            <l n="1.899"> There, to and fro, she paced through many a day </l>
            <l n="1.900"> Of the warm summer, from a belt of hemp </l>
            <l n="1.901"> That girt her waist, spinning the long-drawn thread </l>
            <l n="1.902"> With backward steps. Yet ever as there passed </l>
            <l n="1.903"> A man whose garments showed the soldier's red, </l>
            <l n="1.904"> Or crippled mendicant in sailor's garb, </l>
            <l n="1.905"> The little child who sate to turn the wheel </l>
            <l n="1.906"> Ceased from his task; and she with faltering voice </l>
            <l n="1.907"> Made many a fond enquiry; and when they, </l>
            <l n="1.908"> Whose presence gave no comfort, were gone by, </l>
            <l n="1.909"> Her heart was still more sad. And by yon gate, </l>
            <l n="1.910"> That bars the traveller's road, she often stood, </l>
            <l n="1.911"> And when a stranger horseman came, the latch </l>
            <l n="1.912"> Would lift, and in his face look wistfully; </l>
            <l n="1.913"> Most happy, if, from aught discovered there </l>
            <l n="1.914"> Of tender feeling, she might dare repeat </l>
            <l n="1.915"> The same sad question. Meanwhile her poor Hut </l>
            <l n="1.916"> Sank to decay; for he was gone, whose hand, </l>
            <l n="1.917"> At the first nipping of October frost, </l>
            <l n="1.918"> Closed up each chink, and with fresh bands of straw </l>
            <l n="1.919"> Chequered the green-grown thatch. And so she lived </l>
            <l n="1.920"> Through the long winter, reckless and alone; </l>
            <l n="1.921"> Until her house by frost, and thaw, and rain, </l>
            <l n="1.922"> Was sapped; and while she slept, the nightly damps </l>
            <l n="1.923"> Did chill her breast; and in the stormy day </l>
            <l n="1.924"> Her tattered clothes were ruffled by the wind, </l>
            <l n="1.925"> Even at the side of her own fire. Yet still </l>
            <l n="1.926"> She loved this wretched spot, nor would for worlds </l>
            <l n="1.927"> Have parted hence; and still that length of road, </l>
            <l n="1.928"> And this rude bench, one torturing hope endeared, </l>
            <l n="1.929"> Fast rooted at her heart: and here, my Friend,— </l>
            <l n="1.930"> In sickness she remained; and here she died; </l>
            <l n="1.931"> Last human tenant of these ruined walls!” </l>
            <l n="1.932">   The old Man ceased: he saw that I was moved; </l>
            <l n="1.933"> From that low bench, rising instinctively </l>
            <l n="1.934"> I turned aside in weakness, nor had power </l>
            <l n="1.935"> To thank him for the tale which he had told. </l>
            <l n="1.936"> I stood, and leaning o'er the garden wall </l>
            <l n="1.937"> Reviewed that Woman's sufferings; and it seemed </l>
            <l n="1.938"> To comfort me while with a brother's love </l>
            <l n="1.939"> I blessed her in the impotence of grief. </l>
            <l n="1.940"> Then towards the cottage I returned; and traced </l>
            <l n="1.941"> Fondly, though with an interest more mild, </l>
            <l n="1.942"> That secret spirit of humanity </l>
            <l n="1.943"> Which, 'mid the calm oblivious tendencies </l>
            <l n="1.944"> Of nature, 'mid her plants, and weeds, and flowers, </l>
            <l n="1.945"> And silent overgrowings, still survived. </l>
            <l n="1.946"> The old Man, noting this, resumed, and said, </l>
            <l n="1.947"> “My Friend! enough to sorrow you have given, </l>
            <l n="1.948"> The purposes of wisdom ask no more: </l>
            <l n="1.949"> Nor more would she have craved as due to One </l>
            <l n="1.950"> Who, in her worst distress, had ofttimes felt </l>
            <l n="1.951"> The unbounded might of prayer; and learned, with soul </l>
            <l n="1.952"> Fixed on the Cross, that consolation springs, </l>
            <l n="1.953"> From sources deeper far than deepest pain, </l>
            <l n="1.954"> For the meek Sufferer. Why then should we read </l>
            <l n="1.955"> The forms of things with an unworthy eye? </l>
            <l n="1.956"> She sleeps in the calm earth, and peace is here. </l>
            <l n="1.957"> I well remember that those very plumes, </l>
            <l n="1.958"> Those weeds, and the high spear-grass on that wall, </l>
            <l n="1.959"> By mist and silent rain-drops silvered o'er, </l>
            <l n="1.960"> As once I passed, into my heart conveyed </l>
            <l n="1.961"> So still an image of tranquillity, </l>
            <l n="1.962"> So calm and still, and looked so beautiful </l>
            <l n="1.963"> Amid the uneasy thoughts which filled my mind, </l>
            <l n="1.964"> That what we feel of sorrow and despair </l>
            <l n="1.965"> From ruin and from change, and all the grief </l>
            <l n="1.966"> That passing shows of Being leave behind, </l>
            <l n="1.967"> Appeared an idle dream, that could maintain, </l>
            <l n="1.968"> Nowhere, dominion o'er the enlightened spirit </l>
            <l n="1.969"> Whose meditative sympathies repose </l>
            <l n="1.970"> Upon the breast of Faith. I turned away, </l>
            <l n="1.971"> And walked along my road in happiness.” </l>
            <l n="1.972">   He ceased. Ere long the sun declining shot </l>
            <l n="1.973"> A slant and mellow radiance, which began </l>
            <l n="1.974"> To fall upon us, while, beneath the trees, </l>
            <l n="1.975"> We sate on that low bench: and now we felt, </l>
            <l n="1.976"> Admonished thus, the sweet hour coming on. </l>
            <l n="1.977"> A linnet warbled from those lofty elms, </l>
            <l n="1.978"> A thrush sang loud, and other melodies, </l>
            <l n="1.979"> At distance heard, peopled the milder air. </l>
            <l n="1.980"> The old Man rose, and, with a sprightly mien </l>
            <l n="1.981"> Of hopeful preparation, grasped his staff; </l>
            <l n="1.982"> Together casting then a farewell look </l>
            <l n="1.983"> Upon those silent walls, we left the shade; </l>
            <l n="1.984"> And, ere the stars were visible, had reached </l>
            <l n="1.985"> A village-inn,—our evening resting-place. </l>

</p>
            <l n="2.1"> IN days of yore how fortunately fared </l>
            <l n="2.2"> The Minstrel! wandering on from hall to hall, </l>
            <l n="2.3"> Baronial court or royal; cheered with gifts </l>
            <l n="2.4"> Munificent, and love, and ladies' praise; </l>
            <l n="2.5"> Now meeting on his road an armed knight, </l>
            <l n="2.6"> Now resting with a pilgrim by the side </l>
            <l n="2.7"> Of a clear brook;—beneath an abbey's roof </l>
            <l n="2.8"> One evening sumptuously lodged; the next, </l>
            <l n="2.9"> Humbly in a religious hospital; </l>
            <l n="2.10"> Or with some merry outlaws of the wood; </l>
            <l n="2.11"> Or haply shrouded in a hermit's cell. </l>
            <l n="2.12"> Him, sleeping or awake, the robber spared; </l>
            <l n="2.13"> He walked—protected from the sword of war </l>
            <l n="2.14"> By virtue of that sacred instrument </l>
            <l n="2.15"> His harp, suspended at the traveller's side; </l>
            <l n="2.16"> His dear companion wheresoe'er he went </l>
            <l n="2.17"> Opening from land to land an easy way </l>
            <l n="2.18"> By melody, and by the charm of verse. </l>
            <l n="2.19"> Yet not the noblest of that honoured Race </l>
            <l n="2.20"> Drew happier, loftier, more empassioned, thoughts </l>
            <l n="2.21"> From his long journeyings and eventful life, </l>
            <l n="2.22"> Than this obscure Itinerant had skill </l>
            <l n="2.23"> To gather, ranging through the tamer ground </l>
            <l n="2.24"> Of these our unimaginative days; </l>
            <l n="2.25"> Both while he trod the earth in humblest guise </l>
            <l n="2.26"> Accoutred with his burthen and his staff; </l>
            <l n="2.27"> And now, when free to move with lighter pace. </l>
            <l n="2.28">   What wonder, then, if I, whose favourite school </l>
            <l n="2.29"> Hath been the fields, the roads, and rural lanes, </l>
            <l n="2.30"> Looked on this guide with reverential love? </l>
            <l n="2.31"> Each with the other pleased, we now pursued </l>
            <l n="2.32"> Our journey, under favourable skies. </l>
            <l n="2.33"> Turn wheresoe'er we would, he was a light </l>
            <l n="2.34"> Unfailing: not a hamlet could we pass, </l>
            <l n="2.35"> Rarely a house, that did not yield to him </l>
            <l n="2.36"> Remembrances; or from his tongue call forth </l>
            <l n="2.37"> Some way-beguiling tale. Nor less regard </l>
            <l n="2.38"> Accompanied those strains of apt discourse, </l>
            <l n="2.39"> Which nature's various objects might inspire; </l>
            <l n="2.40"> And in the silence of his face I read </l>
            <l n="2.41"> His overflowing spirit. Birds and beasts, </l>
            <l n="2.42"> And the mute fish that glances in the stream, </l>
            <l n="2.43"> And harmless reptile coiling in the sun, </l>
            <l n="2.44"> And gorgeous insect hovering in the air, </l>
            <l n="2.45"> The fowl domestic, and the household dog— </l>
            <l n="2.46"> In his capacious mind, he loved them all: </l>
            <l n="2.47"> Their rights acknowledging he felt for all. </l>
            <l n="2.48"> Oft was occasion given me to perceive </l>
            <l n="2.49"> How the calm pleasures of the pasturing herd </l>
            <l n="2.50"> To happy contemplation soothed his walk; </l>
            <l n="2.51"> How the poor brute's condition, forced to run </l>
            <l n="2.52"> Its course of suffering in the public road, </l>
            <l n="2.53"> Sad contrast! all too often smote his heart </l>
            <l n="2.54"> With unavailing pity. Rich in love </l>
            <l n="2.55"> And sweet humanity, he was, himself, </l>
            <l n="2.56"> To the degree that he desired, beloved. </l>
            <l n="2.57"> Smiles of good-will from faces that he knew </l>
            <l n="2.58"> Greeted us all day long; we took our seats </l>
            <l n="2.59"> By many a cottage-hearth, where he received </l>
            <l n="2.60"> The welcome of an Inmate from afar, </l>
            <l n="2.61"> And I at once forgot, I was a Stranger. </l>
            <l n="2.62"> —Nor was he loth to enter ragged huts, </l>
            <l n="2.63"> Huts where his charity was blest; his voice </l>
            <l n="2.64"> Heard as the voice of an experienced friend. </l>
            <l n="2.65"> And, sometimes—where the poor man held dispute </l>
            <l n="2.66"> With his own mind, unable to subdue </l>
            <l n="2.67"> Impatience through inaptness to perceive </l>
            <l n="2.68"> General distress in his particular lot; </l>
            <l n="2.69"> Or cherishing resentment, or in vain </l>
            <l n="2.70"> Struggling against it; with a soul perplexed, </l>
            <l n="2.71"> And finding in herself no steady power </l>
            <l n="2.72"> To draw the line of comfort that divides </l>
            <l n="2.73"> Calamity, the chastisement of Heaven, </l>
            <l n="2.74"> From the injustice of our brother men— </l>
            <l n="2.75"> To him appeal was made as to a judge; </l>
            <l n="2.76"> Who, with an understanding heart, allayed </l>
            <l n="2.77"> The perturbation; listened to the plea; </l>
            <l n="2.78"> Resolved the dubious point; and sentence gave </l>
            <l n="2.79"> So grounded, so applied, that it was heard </l>
            <l n="2.80"> With softened spirit, even when it condemned. </l>
            <l n="2.81">   Such intercourse I witnessed, while we roved, </l>
            <l n="2.82"> Now as his choice directed, now as mine; </l>
            <l n="2.83"> Or both, with equal readiness of will, </l>
            <l n="2.84"> Our course submitting to the changeful breeze </l>
            <l n="2.85"> Of accident. But when the rising sun </l>
            <l n="2.86"> Had three times called us to renew our walk, </l>
            <l n="2.87"> My Fellow-traveller, with earnest voice, </l>
            <l n="2.88"> As if the thought were but a moment old, </l>
            <l n="2.89"> Claimed absolute dominion for the day. </l>
            <l n="2.90"> We started—and he led me toward the hills, </l>
            <l n="2.91"> Up through an ample vale, with higher hills </l>
            <l n="2.92"> Before us, mountains stern and desolate; </l>
            <l n="2.93"> But, in the majesty of distance, now </l>
            <l n="2.94"> Set off, and to our ken appearing fair </l>
            <l n="2.95"> Of aspect, with aerial softness clad, </l>
            <l n="2.96"> And beautified with morning's purple beams. </l>
            <l n="2.97">   The wealthy, the luxurious, by the stress </l>
            <l n="2.98"> Of business roused, or pleasure, ere their time, </l>
            <l n="2.99"> May roll in chariots, or provoke the hoofs </l>
            <l n="2.100"> Of the fleet coursers they bestride, to raise </l>
            <l n="2.101"> From earth the dust of morning, slow to rise; </l>
            <l n="2.102"> And they, if blest with health and hearts at ease, </l>
            <l n="2.103"> Shall lack not their enjoyment:—but how faint </l>
            <l n="2.104"> Compared with ours! who, pacing side by side, </l>
            <l n="2.105"> Could, with an eye of leisure, look on all </l>
            <l n="2.106"> That we beheld; and lend the listening sense </l>
            <l n="2.107"> To every grateful sound of earth and air; </l>
            <l n="2.108"> Pausing at will—our spirits braced, our thoughts </l>
            <l n="2.109"> Pleasant as roses in the thickets blown, </l>
            <l n="2.110"> And pure as dew bathing their crimson leaves. </l>
            <l n="2.111">   Mount slowly, sun! that we may journey long, </l>
            <l n="2.112"> By this dark hill protected from thy beams! </l>
            <l n="2.113"> Such is the summer pilgrim's frequent wish; </l>
            <l n="2.114"> But quickly from among our morning thoughts </l>
            <l n="2.115"> 'Twas chased away: for, toward the western side </l>
            <l n="2.116"> Of the broad vale, casting a casual glance, </l>
            <l n="2.117"> We saw a throng of people; wherefore met? </l>
            <l n="2.118"> Blithe notes of music, suddenly let loose </l>
            <l n="2.119"> On the thrilled ear, and flags uprising, yield </l>
            <l n="2.120"> Prompt answer; they proclaim the annual Wake, </l>
            <l n="2.121"> Which the bright season favours.—Tabor and pipe </l>
            <l n="2.122"> In purpose join to hasten or reprove </l>
            <l n="2.123"> The laggard Rustic; and repay with boons </l>
            <l n="2.124"> Of merriment a party-coloured knot, </l>
            <l n="2.125"> Already formed upon the village-green. </l>
            <l n="2.126"> —Beyond the limits of the shadow cast </l>
            <l n="2.127"> By the broad hill, glistened upon our sight </l>
            <l n="2.128"> That gay assemblage. Round them and above, </l>
            <l n="2.129"> Glitter, with dark recesses interposed, </l>
            <l n="2.130"> Casement, and cottage-roof, and stems of trees </l>
            <l n="2.131"> Half-veiled in vapoury cloud, the silver steam </l>
            <l n="2.132"> Of dews fast melting on their leafy boughs </l>
            <l n="2.133"> By the strong sunbeams smitten. Like a mast </l>
            <l n="2.134"> Of gold, the Maypole shines; as if the rays </l>
            <l n="2.135"> Of morning, aided by exhaling dew, </l>
            <l n="2.136"> With gladsome influence could re-animate </l>
            <l n="2.137"> The faded garlands dangling from its sides. </l>
            <l n="2.138">   Said I, “The music and the sprightly scene </l>
            <l n="2.139"> Invite us; shall we quit our road, and join </l>
            <l n="2.140"> These festive matins?”—He replied, “Not loth </l>
            <l n="2.141"> To linger I would here with you partake, </l>
            <l n="2.142"> Not one hour merely, but till evening's close, </l>
            <l n="2.143"> The simple pastimes of the day and place. </l>
            <l n="2.144"> By the fleet Racers, ere the sun be set, </l>
            <l n="2.145"> The turf of yon large pasture will be skimmed; </l>
            <l n="2.146"> There, too, the lusty Wrestlers shall contend: </l>
            <l n="2.147"> But know we not that he, who intermits </l>
            <l n="2.148"> The appointed task and duties of the day, </l>
            <l n="2.149"> Untunes full oft the pleasures of the day; </l>
            <l n="2.150"> Checking the finer spirits that refuse </l>
            <l n="2.151"> To flow when purposes are lightly changed? </l>
            <l n="2.152"> A length of journey yet remains untraced: </l>
            <l n="2.153"> Let us proceed.” Then, pointing with his staff </l>
            <l n="2.154"> Raised toward those craggy summits, his intent </l>
            <l n="2.155"> He thus imparted:— </l>
            <l n="2.156">                      “In a spot that lies </l>
            <l n="2.157"> Among yon mountain fastnesses concealed, </l>
            <l n="2.158"> You will receive, before the hour of noon, </l>
            <l n="2.159"> Good recompense, I hope, for this day's toil, </l>
            <l n="2.160"> From sight of One who lives secluded there, </l>
            <l n="2.161"> Lonesome and lost: of whom, and whose past life, </l>
            <l n="2.162"> (Not to forestall such knowledge as may be </l>
            <l n="2.163"> More faithfully collected from himself) </l>
            <l n="2.164"> This brief communication shall suffice. </l>
            <l n="2.165">   Though now sojourning there, he, like myself, </l>
            <l n="2.166"> Sprang from a stock of lowly parentage </l>
            <l n="2.167"> Among the wilds of Scotland, in a tract </l>
            <l n="2.168"> Where many a sheltered and well-tended plant, </l>
            <l n="2.169"> Bears, on the humblest ground of social life, </l>
            <l n="2.170"> Blossoms of piety and innocence. </l>
            <l n="2.171"> Such grateful promises his youth displayed: </l>
            <l n="2.172"> And, having shown in study forward zeal, </l>
            <l n="2.173"> He to the Ministry was duly called; </l>
            <l n="2.174"> And straight, incited by a curious mind </l>
            <l n="2.175"> Filled with vague hopes, he undertook the charge </l>
            <l n="2.176"> Of Chaplain to a military troop </l>
            <l n="2.177"> Cheered by the Highland bagpipe, as they marched </l>
            <l n="2.178"> In plaided vest,—his fellow-countrymen. </l>
            <l n="2.179"> This office filling, yet by native power </l>
            <l n="2.180"> And force of native inclination made </l>
            <l n="2.181"> An intellectual ruler in the haunts </l>
            <l n="2.182"> Of social vanity, he walked the world, </l>
            <l n="2.183"> Gay, and affecting graceful gaiety; </l>
            <l n="2.184"> Lax, buoyant—less a pastor with his flock </l>
            <l n="2.185"> Than a soldier among soldiers—lived and roamed </l>
            <l n="2.186"> Where Fortune led:—and Fortune, who oft proves </l>
            <l n="2.187"> The careless wanderer's friend, to him made known </l>
            <l n="2.188"> A blooming Lady—a conspicuous flower, </l>
            <l n="2.189"> Admired for beauty, for her sweetness praised; </l>
            <l n="2.190"> Whom he had sensibility to love, </l>
            <l n="2.191"> Ambition to attempt, and skill to win. </l>
            <l n="2.192">   For this fair Bride, most rich in gifts of mind, </l>
            <l n="2.193"> Nor sparingly endowed with worldly wealth, </l>
            <l n="2.194"> His office he relinquished; and retired </l>
            <l n="2.195"> From the world's notice to a rural home. </l>
            <l n="2.196"> Youth's season yet with him was scarcely past, </l>
            <l n="2.197"> And she was in youth's prime. How free their love, </l>
            <l n="2.198"> How full their joy! 'Till, pitiable doom! </l>
            <l n="2.199"> In the short course of one undreaded year </l>
            <l n="2.200"> Death blasted all. Death suddenly o'erthrew </l>
            <l n="2.201"> Two lovely Children—all that they possessed! </l>
            <l n="2.202"> The Mother followed:—miserably bare </l>
            <l n="2.203"> The one Survivor stood; he wept, he prayed </l>
            <l n="2.204"> For his dismissal, day and night, compelled </l>
            <l n="2.205"> To hold communion with the grave, and face </l>
            <l n="2.206"> With pain the regions of eternity. </l>
            <l n="2.207"> An uncomplaining apathy displaced </l>
            <l n="2.208"> This anguish; and, indifferent to delight, </l>
            <l n="2.209"> To aim and purpose, he consumed his days, </l>
            <l n="2.210"> To private interest dead, and public care. </l>
            <l n="2.211"> So lived he; so he might have died. </l>
            <l n="2.212">                                      But now, </l>
            <l n="2.213"> To the wide world's astonishment, appeared </l>
            <l n="2.214"> A glorious opening, the unlooked-for dawn, </l>
            <l n="2.215"> That promised everlasting joy to France! </l>
            <l n="2.216"> Her voice of social transport reached even him! </l>
            <l n="2.217"> He broke from his contracted bounds, repaired </l>
            <l n="2.218"> To the great City, an emporium then </l>
            <l n="2.219"> Of golden expectations, and receiving </l>
            <l n="2.220"> Freights every day from a new world of hope. </l>
            <l n="2.221"> Thither his popular talents he transferred; </l>
            <l n="2.222"> And, from the pulpit, zealously maintained </l>
            <l n="2.223"> The cause of Christ and civil liberty, </l>
            <l n="2.224"> As one, and moving to one glorious end. </l>
            <l n="2.225"> Intoxicating service! I might say </l>
            <l n="2.226"> A happy service; for he was sincere </l>
            <l n="2.227"> As vanity and fondness for applause, </l>
            <l n="2.228"> And new and shapeless wishes, would allow. </l>
            <l n="2.229">   That righteous cause (such power hath freedom) bound, </l>
            <l n="2.230"> For one hostility, in friendly league, </l>
            <l n="2.231"> Ethereal natures and the worst of slaves; </l>
            <l n="2.232"> Was served by rival advocates that came </l>
            <l n="2.233"> From regions opposite as heaven and hell. </l>
            <l n="2.234"> One courage seemed to animate them all: </l>
            <l n="2.235"> And, from the dazzling conquests daily gained </l>
            <l n="2.236"> By their united efforts, there arose </l>
            <l n="2.237"> A proud and most presumptuous confidence </l>
            <l n="2.238"> In the transcendent wisdom of the age, </l>
            <l n="2.239"> And her discernment; not alone in rights, </l>
            <l n="2.240"> And in the origin and bounds of power </l>
            <l n="2.241"> Social and temporal; but in laws divine, </l>
            <l n="2.242"> Deduced by reason, or to faith revealed. </l>
            <l n="2.243"> An overweening trust was raised; and fear </l>
            <l n="2.244"> Cast out, alike of person and of thing. </l>
            <l n="2.245"> Plague from this union spread, whose subtle bane </l>
            <l n="2.246"> The strongest did not easily escape; </l>
            <l n="2.247"> And He, what wonder! took a mortal taint. </l>
            <l n="2.248"> How shall I trace the change, how bear to tell </l>
            <l n="2.249"> That he broke faith with them whom he had laid </l>
            <l n="2.250"> In earth's dark chambers, with a Christian's hope! </l>
            <l n="2.251"> An infidel contempt of holy writ </l>
            <l n="2.252"> Stole by degrees upon his mind; and hence </l>
            <l n="2.253"> Life, like that Roman Janus, double-faced; </l>
            <l n="2.254"> Vilest hypocrisy—the laughing, gay </l>
            <l n="2.255"> Hypocrisy, not leagued with fear, but pride. </l>
            <l n="2.256"> Smooth words he had to wheedle simple souls; </l>
            <l n="2.257"> But, for disciples of the inner school, </l>
            <l n="2.258"> Old freedom was old servitude, and they </l>
            <l n="2.259"> The wisest whose opinions stooped the least </l>
            <l n="2.260"> To known restraints; and who most boldly drew </l>
            <l n="2.261"> Hopeful prognostications from a creed, </l>
            <l n="2.262"> That, in the light of false philosophy, </l>
            <l n="2.263"> Spread like a halo round a misty moon, </l>
            <l n="2.264"> Widening its circle as the storms advance. </l>
            <l n="2.265">   His sacred function was at length renounced; </l>
            <l n="2.266"> And every day and every place enjoyed </l>
            <l n="2.267"> The unshackled layman's natural liberty; </l>
            <l n="2.268"> Speech, manners, morals, all without disguise. </l>
            <l n="2.269"> I do not wish to wrong him; though the course </l>
            <l n="2.270"> Of private life licentiously displayed </l>
            <l n="2.271"> Unhallowed actions—planted like a crown </l>
            <l n="2.272"> Upon the insolent aspiring brow </l>
            <l n="2.273"> Of spurious notions—worn as open signs </l>
            <l n="2.274"> Of prejudice subdued—still he retained, </l>
            <l n="2.275"> 'Mid much abasement, what he had received </l>
            <l n="2.276"> From nature, an intense and glowing mind. </l>
            <l n="2.277"> Wherefore, when humbled Liberty grew weak, </l>
            <l n="2.278"> And mortal sickness on her face appeared, </l>
            <l n="2.279"> He coloured objects to his own desire </l>
            <l n="2.280"> As with a lover's passion. Yet his moods </l>
            <l n="2.281"> Of pain were keen as those of better men, </l>
            <l n="2.282"> Nay keener, as his fortitude was less: </l>
            <l n="2.283"> And he continued, when worse days were come, </l>
            <l n="2.284"> To deal about his sparkling eloquence, </l>
            <l n="2.285"> Struggling against the strange reverse with zeal </l>
            <l n="2.286"> That showed like happiness. But, in despite </l>
            <l n="2.287"> Of all this outside bravery, within, </l>
            <l n="2.288"> He neither felt encouragement nor hope: </l>
            <l n="2.289"> For moral dignity, and strength of mind, </l>
            <l n="2.290"> Were wanting; and simplicity of life; </l>
            <l n="2.291"> And reverence for himself; and, last and best, </l>
            <l n="2.292"> Confiding thoughts, through love and fear of Him </l>
            <l n="2.293"> Before whose sight the troubles of this world </l>
            <l n="2.294"> Are vain, as billows in a tossing sea. </l>
            <l n="2.295">   The glory of the times fading away— </l>
            <l n="2.296"> The splendour, which had given a festal air </l>
            <l n="2.297"> To self-importance, hallowed it, and veiled </l>
            <l n="2.298"> From his own sight—this gone, he forfeited </l>
            <l n="2.299"> All joy in human nature; was consumed, </l>
            <l n="2.300"> And vexed, and chafed, by levity and scorn, </l>
            <l n="2.301"> And fruitless indignation; galled by pride; </l>
            <l n="2.302"> Made desperate by contempt of men who throve </l>
            <l n="2.303"> Before his sight in power or fame, and won, </l>
            <l n="2.304"> Without desert, what he desired; weak men, </l>
            <l n="2.305"> Too weak even for his envy or his hate! </l>
            <l n="2.306"> Tormented thus, after a wandering course </l>
            <l n="2.307"> Of discontent, and inwardly opprest </l>
            <l n="2.308"> With malady—in part, I fear, provoked </l>
            <l n="2.309"> By weariness of life—he fixed his home, </l>
            <l n="2.310"> Or, rather say, sate down by very chance, </l>
            <l n="2.311"> Among these rugged hills; where now he dwells, </l>
            <l n="2.312"> And wastes the sad remainder of his hours, </l>
            <l n="2.313"> Steeped in a self-indulging spleen, that wants not </l>
            <l n="2.314"> Its own voluptuousness;—on this resolved, </l>
            <l n="2.315"> With this content, that he will live and die </l>
            <l n="2.316"> Forgotten,—at safe distance from 'a world </l>
            <l n="2.317"> Not moving to his mind.'” </l>
            <l n="2.318">                            These serious words </l>
            <l n="2.319"> Closed the preparatory notices </l>
            <l n="2.320"> That served my Fellow-traveller to beguile </l>
            <l n="2.321"> The way, while we advanced up that wide vale. </l>
            <l n="2.322"> Diverging now (as if his quest had been </l>
            <l n="2.323"> Some secret of the mountains, cavern, fall </l>
            <l n="2.324"> Of water, or some lofty eminence, </l>
            <l n="2.325"> Renowned for splendid prospect far and wide) </l>
            <l n="2.326"> We scaled, without a track to ease our steps, </l>
            <l n="2.327"> A steep ascent; and reached a dreary plain, </l>
            <l n="2.328"> With a tumultuous waste of huge hill tops </l>
            <l n="2.329"> Before us; savage region! which I paced </l>
            <l n="2.330"> Dispirited: when, all at once, behold! </l>
            <l n="2.331"> Beneath our feet, a little lowly vale, </l>
            <l n="2.332"> A lowly vale, and yet uplifted high </l>
            <l n="2.333"> Among the mountains; even as if the spot </l>
            <l n="2.334"> Had been from eldest time by wish of theirs </l>
            <l n="2.335"> So placed, to be shut out from all the world! </l>
            <l n="2.336"> Urn-like it was in shape, deep as an urn; </l>
            <l n="2.337"> With rocks encompassed, save that to the south </l>
            <l n="2.338"> Was one small opening, where a heath-clad ridge </l>
            <l n="2.339"> Supplied a boundary less abrupt and close; </l>
            <l n="2.340"> A quiet treeless nook, with two green fields, </l>
            <l n="2.341"> A liquid pool that glittered in the sun, </l>
            <l n="2.342"> And one bare dwelling; one abode, no more! </l>
            <l n="2.343"> It seemed the home of poverty and toil, </l>
            <l n="2.344"> Though not of want: the little fields, made green </l>
            <l n="2.345"> By husbandry of many thrifty years, </l>
            <l n="2.346"> Paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house. </l>
            <l n="2.347"> —There crows the cock, single in his domain: </l>
            <l n="2.348"> The small birds find in spring no thicket there </l>
            <l n="2.349"> To shroud them; only from the neighbouring vales </l>
            <l n="2.350"> The cuckoo, straggling up to the hill tops, </l>
            <l n="2.351"> Shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place. </l>
            <l n="2.352">   Ah! what a sweet Recess, thought I, is here! </l>
            <l n="2.353"> Instantly throwing down my limbs at ease </l>
            <l n="2.354"> Upon a bed of heath;—full many a spot </l>
            <l n="2.355"> Of hidden beauty have I chanced to espy </l>
            <l n="2.356"> Among the mountains; never one like this; </l>
            <l n="2.357"> So lonesome, and so perfectly secure; </l>
            <l n="2.358"> Not melancholy—no, for it is green, </l>
            <l n="2.359"> And bright, and fertile, furnished in itself </l>
            <l n="2.360"> With the few needful things that life requires. </l>
            <l n="2.361"> —In rugged arms how softly does it lie, </l>
            <l n="2.362"> How tenderly protected! Far and near </l>
            <l n="2.363"> We have an image of the pristine earth, </l>
            <l n="2.364"> The planet in its nakedness: were this </l>
            <l n="2.365"> Man's only dwelling, sole appointed seat, </l>
            <l n="2.366"> First, last, and single, in the breathing world, </l>
            <l n="2.367"> It could not be more quiet; peace is here </l>
            <l n="2.368"> Or nowhere; days unruffled by the gale </l>
            <l n="2.369"> Of public news or private; years that pass </l>
            <l n="2.370"> Forgetfully; uncalled upon to pay </l>
            <l n="2.371"> The common penalties of mortal life, </l>
            <l n="2.372"> Sickness, or accident, or grief, or pain. </l>
            <l n="2.373">   On these and kindred thoughts intent I lay </l>
            <l n="2.374"> In silence musing by my Comrade's side, </l>
            <l n="2.375"> He also silent; when from out the heart </l>
            <l n="2.376"> Of that profound abyss a solemn voice, </l>
            <l n="2.377"> Or several voices in one solemn sound, </l>
            <l n="2.378"> Was heard ascending; mournful, deep, and slow </l>
            <l n="2.379"> The cadence, as of psalms—a funeral dirge! </l>
            <l n="2.380"> We listened, looking down upon the hut, </l>
            <l n="2.381"> But seeing no one: meanwhile from below </l>
            <l n="2.382"> The strain continued, spiritual as before; </l>
            <l n="2.383"> And now distinctly could I recognise </l>
            <l n="2.384"> These words:—“Shall in the grave thy love be known, </l>
            <l n="2.385"> In death thy faithfulness?”—“God rest his soul!” </l>
            <l n="2.386"> Said the old man, abruptly breaking silence,— </l>
            <l n="2.387"> “He is departed, and finds peace at last!” </l>
            <l n="2.388">   This scarcely spoken, and those holy strains </l>
            <l n="2.389"> Not ceasing, forth appeared in view a band </l>
            <l n="2.390"> Of rustic persons, from behind the hut </l>
            <l n="2.391"> Bearing a coffin in the midst, with which </l>
            <l n="2.392"> They shaped their course along the sloping side </l>
            <l n="2.393"> Of that small valley, singing as they moved; </l>
            <l n="2.394"> A sober company and few, the men </l>
            <l n="2.395"> Bare-headed, and all decently attired! </l>
            <l n="2.396"> Some steps when they had thus advanced, the dirge </l>
            <l n="2.397"> Ended; and, from the stillness that ensued </l>
            <l n="2.398"> Recovering, to my Friend I said, “You spake, </l>
            <l n="2.399"> Methought, with apprehension that these rites </l>
            <l n="2.400"> Are paid to Him upon whose shy retreat </l>
            <l n="2.401"> This day we purposed to intrude.”—“I did so, </l>
            <l n="2.402"> But let us hence, that we may learn the truth: </l>
            <l n="2.403"> Perhaps it is not he but some one else </l>
            <l n="2.404"> For whom this pious service is performed; </l>
            <l n="2.405"> Some other tenant of the solitude.” </l>
            <l n="2.406">   So, to a steep and difficult descent </l>
            <l n="2.407"> Trusting ourselves, we wound from crag to crag, </l>
            <l n="2.408"> Where passage could be won; and, as the last </l>
            <l n="2.409"> Of the mute train, behind the heathy top </l>
            <l n="2.410"> Of that off-sloping outlet, disappeared, </l>
            <l n="2.411"> I, more impatient in my downward course, </l>
            <l n="2.412"> Had landed upon easy ground; and there </l>
            <l n="2.413"> Stood waiting for my Comrade. When behold </l>
            <l n="2.414"> An object that enticed my steps aside! </l>
            <l n="2.415"> A narrow, winding, entry opened out </l>
            <l n="2.416"> Into a platform—that lay, sheepfold-wise, </l>
            <l n="2.417"> Enclosed between an upright mass of rock </l>
            <l n="2.418"> And one old moss-grown wall;—a cool recess, </l>
            <l n="2.419"> And fanciful! For where the rock and wall </l>
            <l n="2.420"> Met in an angle, hung a penthouse, framed </l>
            <l n="2.421"> By thrusting two rude staves into the wall </l>
            <l n="2.422"> And overlaying them with mountain sods; </l>
            <l n="2.423"> To weather-fend a little turf-built seat </l>
            <l n="2.424"> Whereon a full-grown man might rest, nor dread </l>
            <l n="2.425"> The burning sunshine, or a transient shower; </l>
            <l n="2.426"> But the whole plainly wrought by children's hands! </l>
            <l n="2.427"> Whose skill had thronged the floor with a proud show </l>
            <l n="2.428"> Of baby-houses, curiously arranged; </l>
            <l n="2.429"> Nor wanting ornament of walks between, </l>
            <l n="2.430"> With mimic trees inserted in the turf, </l>
            <l n="2.431"> And gardens interposed. Pleased with the sight, </l>
            <l n="2.432"> I could not choose but beckon to my Guide, </l>
            <l n="2.433"> Who, entering, round him threw a careless glance, </l>
            <l n="2.434"> Impatient to pass on, when I exclaimed, </l>
            <l n="2.435"> “Lo! what is here?” and, stooping down, drew forth </l>
            <l n="2.436"> A book, that, in the midst of stones and moss </l>
            <l n="2.437"> And wreck of party-coloured earthen-ware, </l>
            <l n="2.438"> Aptly disposed, had lent its help to raise </l>
            <l n="2.439"> One of those petty structures. “His it must be!” </l>
            <l n="2.440"> Exclaimed the Wanderer, “cannot but be his, </l>
            <l n="2.441"> And he is gone!” The book, which in my hand </l>
            <l n="2.442"> Had opened of itself (for it was swoln </l>
            <l n="2.443"> With searching damp, and seemingly had lain </l>
            <l n="2.444"> To the injurious elements exposed </l>
            <l n="2.445"> From week to week,) I found to be a work </l>
            <l n="2.446"> In the French tongue, a Novel of Voltaire, </l>
            <l n="2.447"> His famous Optimist. “Unhappy Man!” </l>
            <l n="2.448"> Exclaimed my Friend: “here then has been to him </l>
            <l n="2.449"> Retreat within retreat, a sheltering-place </l>
            <l n="2.450"> Within how deep a shelter! He had fits, </l>
            <l n="2.451"> Even to the last, of genuine tenderness, </l>
            <l n="2.452"> And loved the haunts of children: here, no doubt, </l>
            <l n="2.453"> Pleasing and pleased, he shared their simple sports, </l>
            <l n="2.454"> Or sate companionless; and here the book, </l>
            <l n="2.455"> Left and forgotten in his careless way, </l>
            <l n="2.456"> Must by the cottage-children have been found: </l>
            <l n="2.457"> Heaven bless them, and their inconsiderate work! </l>
            <l n="2.458"> To what odd purpose have the darlings turned </l>
            <l n="2.459"> This sad memorial of their hapless friend!” </l>
            <l n="2.460">   “Me,” said I, “most doth it surprise, to find </l>
            <l n="2.461"> Such book in such a place!”—“A book it is,” </l>
            <l n="2.462"> He answered, “to the Person suited well, </l>
            <l n="2.463"> Though little suited to surrounding things: </l>
            <l n="2.464"> 'Tis strange, I grant; and stranger still had been </l>
            <l n="2.465"> To see the Man who owned it, dwelling here, </l>
            <l n="2.466"> With one poor shepherd, far from all the world!— </l>
            <l n="2.467"> Now, if our errand hath been thrown away, </l>
            <l n="2.468"> As from these intimations I forebode, </l>
            <l n="2.469"> Grieved shall I be—less for my sake than yours, </l>
            <l n="2.470"> And least of all for him who is no more.” </l>
            <l n="2.471">   By this, the book was in the old Man's hand; </l>
            <l n="2.472"> And he continued, glancing on the leaves </l>
            <l n="2.473"> An eye of scorn:—“The lover,” said he, “doomed </l>
            <l n="2.474"> To love when hope hath failed him—whom no depth </l>
            <l n="2.475"> Of privacy is deep enough to hide, </l>
            <l n="2.476"> Hath yet his bracelet or his lock of hair, </l>
            <l n="2.477"> And that is joy to him. When change of times </l>
            <l n="2.478"> Hath summoned kings to scaffolds, do but give </l>
            <l n="2.479"> The faithful servant, who must hide his head </l>
            <l n="2.480"> Henceforth in whatsoever nook he may, </l>
            <l n="2.481"> A kerchief sprinkled with his master's blood, </l>
            <l n="2.482"> And he too hath his comforter. How poor, </l>
            <l n="2.483"> Beyond all poverty how destitute, </l>
            <l n="2.484"> Must that Man have been left, who, hither driven, </l>
            <l n="2.485"> Flying or seeking, could yet bring with him </l>
            <l n="2.486"> No dearer relique, and no better stay, </l>
            <l n="2.487"> Than this dull product of a scoffer's pen, </l>
            <l n="2.488"> Impure conceits discharging from a heart </l>
            <l n="2.489"> Hardened by impious pride!—I did not fear </l>
            <l n="2.490"> To tax you with this journey;”—mildly said </l>
            <l n="2.491"> My venerable Friend, as forth we stepped </l>
            <l n="2.492"> Into the presence of the cheerful light— </l>
            <l n="2.493"> “For I have knowledge that you do not shrink </l>
            <l n="2.494"> From moving spectacles;—but let us on.” </l>
            <l n="2.495">   So speaking, on he went, and at the word </l>
            <l n="2.496"> I followed, till he made a sudden stand: </l>
            <l n="2.497"> For full in view, approaching through a gate </l>
            <l n="2.498"> That opened from the enclosure of green fields </l>
            <l n="2.499"> Into the rough uncultivated ground, </l>
            <l n="2.500"> Behold the Man whom he had fancied dead! </l>
            <l n="2.501"> I knew from his deportment, mien, and dress, </l>
            <l n="2.502"> That it could be no other; a pale face, </l>
            <l n="2.503"> A meagre person, tall, and in a garb </l>
            <l n="2.504"> Not rustic—dull and faded like himself! </l>
            <l n="2.505"> He saw us not, though distant but few steps; </l>
            <l n="2.506"> For he was busy, dealing, from a store </l>
            <l n="2.507"> Upon a broad leaf carried, choicest strings </l>
            <l n="2.508"> Of red ripe currants; gift by which he strove, </l>
            <l n="2.509"> With intermixture of endearing words, </l>
            <l n="2.510"> To soothe a Child, who walked beside him, weeping </l>
            <l n="2.511"> As if disconsolate.—“They to the grave </l>
            <l n="2.512"> Are bearing him, my Little-one,” he said, </l>
            <l n="2.513"> “To the dark pit; but he will feel no pain; </l>
            <l n="2.514"> His body is at rest, his soul in heaven.” </l>
            <l n="2.515">   More might have followed—but my honoured Friend </l>
            <l n="2.516"> Broke in upon the Speaker with a frank </l>
            <l n="2.517"> And cordial greeting.—Vivid was the light </l>
            <l n="2.518"> That flashed and sparkled from the other's eyes; </l>
            <l n="2.519"> He was all fire: no shadow on his brow </l>
            <l n="2.520"> Remained, nor sign of sickness on his face. </l>
            <l n="2.521"> Hands joined he with his Visitant,—a grasp, </l>
            <l n="2.522"> An eager grasp; and many moments' space— </l>
            <l n="2.523"> When the first glow of pleasure was no more, </l>
            <l n="2.524"> And, of the sad appearance which at once </l>
            <l n="2.525"> Had vanished, much was come and coming back— </l>
            <l n="2.526"> An amicable smile retained the life </l>
            <l n="2.527"> Which it had unexpectedly received, </l>
            <l n="2.528"> Upon his hollow cheek. “How kind,” he said, </l>
            <l n="2.529"> “Nor could your coming have been better timed; </l>
            <l n="2.530"> For this, you see, is in our narrow world </l>
            <l n="2.531"> A day of sorrow. I have here a charge”— </l>
            <l n="2.532"> And, speaking thus, he patted tenderly </l>
            <l n="2.533"> The sun-burnt forehead of the weeping child— </l>
            <l n="2.534"> “A little mourner, whom it is my task </l>
            <l n="2.535"> To comfort;—but how came ye?—if yon track </l>
            <l n="2.536"> (Which doth at once befriend us and betray) </l>
            <l n="2.537"> Conducted hither your most welcome feet, </l>
            <l n="2.538"> Ye could not miss the funeral train—they yet </l>
            <l n="2.539"> Have scarcely disappeared.” “This blooming Child,” </l>
            <l n="2.540"> Said the old Man, “is of an age to weep </l>
            <l n="2.541"> At any grave or solemn spectacle, </l>
            <l n="2.542"> Inly distressed or overpowered with awe, </l>
            <l n="2.543"> He knows not wherefore;—but the boy today, </l>
            <l n="2.544"> Perhaps is shedding orphan's tears; you also </l>
            <l n="2.545"> Must have sustained a loss.”—“The hand of Death,” </l>
            <l n="2.546"> He answered, “has been here; but could not well </l>
            <l n="2.547"> Have fallen more lightly, if it had not fallen </l>
            <l n="2.548"> Upon myself.”—The other left these words </l>
            <l n="2.549"> Unnoticed, thus continuing— </l>
            <l n="2.550">                               “From yon crag, </l>
            <l n="2.551"> Down whose steep sides we dropped into the vale, </l>
            <l n="2.552"> We heard the hymn they sang—a solemn sound </l>
            <l n="2.553"> Heard anywhere; but in a place like this </l>
            <l n="2.554"> 'Tis more than human! Many precious rites </l>
            <l n="2.555"> And customs of our rural ancestry </l>
            <l n="2.556"> Are gone, or stealing from us; this, I hope, </l>
            <l n="2.557"> Will last for ever. Oft on my way have I </l>
            <l n="2.558"> Stood still, though but a casual passenger, </l>
            <l n="2.559"> So much I felt the awfulness of life, </l>
            <l n="2.560"> In that one moment when the corse is lifted </l>
            <l n="2.561"> In silence, with a hush of decency; </l>
            <l n="2.562"> Then from the threshold moves with song of peace, </l>
            <l n="2.563"> And confidential yearnings, towards its home, </l>
            <l n="2.564"> Its final home on earth. What traveller—who— </l>
            <l n="2.565"> (How far soe'er a stranger) does not own </l>
            <l n="2.566"> The bond of brotherhood, when he sees them go, </l>
            <l n="2.567"> A mute procession on the houseless road; </l>
            <l n="2.568"> Or passing by some single tenement </l>
            <l n="2.569"> Or clustered dwellings, where again they raise </l>
            <l n="2.570"> The monitory voice? But most of all </l>
            <l n="2.571"> It touches, it confirms, and elevates, </l>
            <l n="2.572"> Then, when the body, soon to be consigned </l>
            <l n="2.573"> Ashes to ashes, dust bequeathed to dust, </l>
            <l n="2.574"> Is raised from the church-aisle, and forward borne </l>
            <l n="2.575"> Upon the shoulders of the next in love, </l>
            <l n="2.576"> The nearest in affection or in blood; </l>
            <l n="2.577"> Yea, by the very mourners who had knelt </l>
            <l n="2.578"> Beside the coffin, resting on its lid </l>
            <l n="2.579"> In silent grief their unuplifted heads, </l>
            <l n="2.580"> And heard meanwhile the Psalmist's mournful plaint, </l>
            <l n="2.581"> And that most awful scripture which declares </l>
            <l n="2.582"> We shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed! </l>
            <l n="2.583"> —Have I not seen—ye likewise may have seen— </l>
            <l n="2.584"> Son, husband, brothers—brothers side by side, </l>
            <l n="2.585"> And son and father also side by side, </l>
            <l n="2.586"> Rise from that posture:—and in concert move, </l>
            <l n="2.587"> On the green turf following the vested Priest, </l>
            <l n="2.588"> Four dear supporters of one senseless weight, </l>
            <l n="2.589"> From which they do not shrink, and under which </l>
            <l n="2.590"> They faint not, but advance towards the open grave </l>
            <l n="2.591"> Step after step—together, with their firm </l>
            <l n="2.592"> Unhidden faces: he that suffers most, </l>
            <l n="2.593"> He outwardly, and inwardly perhaps, </l>
            <l n="2.594"> The most serene, with most undaunted eye!— </l>
            <l n="2.595"> Oh! blest are they who live and die like these, </l>
            <l n="2.596"> Loved with such love, and with such sorrow mourned!” </l>
            <l n="2.597">   “That poor Man taken hence to-day,” replied </l>
            <l n="2.598"> The Solitary, with a faint sarcastic smile </l>
            <l n="2.599"> Which did not please me, “must be deemed, I fear, </l>
            <l n="2.600"> Of the unblest; for he will surely sink </l>
            <l n="2.601"> Into his mother earth without such pomp </l>
            <l n="2.602"> Of grief, depart without occasion given </l>
            <l n="2.603"> By him for such array of fortitude. </l>
            <l n="2.604"> Full seventy winters hath he lived, and mark! </l>
            <l n="2.605"> This simple Child will mourn his one short hour, </l>
            <l n="2.606"> And I shall miss him: scanty tribute! yet, </l>
            <l n="2.607"> This wanting, he would leave the sight of men, </l>
            <l n="2.608"> If love were his sole claim upon their care, </l>
            <l n="2.609"> Like a ripe date which in the desert falls </l>
            <l n="2.610"> Without a hand to gather it.” </l>
            <l n="2.611">                                At this </l>
            <l n="2.612"> I interposed, though loth to speak, and said, </l>
            <l n="2.613"> “Can it be thus among so small a band </l>
            <l n="2.614"> As ye must needs be here? in such a place </l>
            <l n="2.615"> I would not willingly, methinks, lose sight </l>
            <l n="2.616"> Of a departing cloud.”—“'Twas not for love”— </l>
            <l n="2.617"> Answered the sick Man with a careless voice— </l>
            <l n="2.618"> “That I came hither; neither have I found </l>
            <l n="2.619"> Among associates who have power of speech, </l>
            <l n="2.620"> Nor in such other converse as is here, </l>
            <l n="2.621"> Temptation so prevailing as to change </l>
            <l n="2.622"> That mood, or undermine my first resolve.” </l>
            <l n="2.623"> Then, speaking in like careless sort, he said </l>
            <l n="2.624"> To my benign Companion,—“Pity 'tis </l>
            <l n="2.625"> That fortune did not guide you to this house </l>
            <l n="2.626"> A few days earlier; then would you have seen </l>
            <l n="2.627"> What stuff the Dwellers in a solitude, </l>
            <l n="2.628"> That seems by Nature hollowed out to be </l>
            <l n="2.629"> The seat and bosom of pure innocence, </l>
            <l n="2.630"> Are made of; an ungracious matter this! </l>
            <l n="2.631"> Which, for truth's sake, yet in remembrance too </l>
            <l n="2.632"> Of past discussions with this zealous friend </l>
            <l n="2.633"> And advocate of humble life, I now </l>
            <l n="2.634"> Will force upon his notice; undeterred </l>
            <l n="2.635"> By the example of his own pure course, </l>
            <l n="2.636"> And that respect and deference which a soul </l>
            <l n="2.637"> May fairly claim, by niggard age enriched </l>
            <l n="2.638"> In what she most doth value, love of God </l>
            <l n="2.639"> And his frail creature Man;—but ye shall hear. </l>
            <l n="2.640"> I talk—and ye are standing in the sun </l>
            <l n="2.641"> Without refreshment!” </l>
            <l n="2.642">                        Quickly had he spoken, </l>
            <l n="2.643"> And, with light steps still quicker than his words, </l>
            <l n="2.644"> Led toward the Cottage. Homely was the spot; </l>
            <l n="2.645"> And, to my feeling, ere we reached the door, </l>
            <l n="2.646"> Had almost a forbidding nakedness; </l>
            <l n="2.647"> Less fair, I grant, even painfully less fair, </l>
            <l n="2.648"> Than it appeared when from the beetling rock </l>
            <l n="2.649"> We had looked down upon it. All within, </l>
            <l n="2.650"> As left by the departed company, </l>
            <l n="2.651"> Was silent; save the solitary clock </l>
            <l n="2.652"> That on mine ear ticked with a mournful sound.— </l>
            <l n="2.653"> Following our Guide we clomb the cottage-stairs </l>
            <l n="2.654"> And reached a small apartment dark and low, </l>
            <l n="2.655"> Which was no sooner entered than our Host </l>
            <l n="2.656"> Said gaily, “This is my domain, my cell, </l>
            <l n="2.657"> My hermitage, my cabin, what you will— </l>
            <l n="2.658"> I love it better than a snail his house. </l>
            <l n="2.659"> But now ye shall be feasted with our best.” </l>
            <l n="2.660">   So, with more ardour than an unripe girl </l>
            <l n="2.661"> Left one day mistress of her mother's stores, </l>
            <l n="2.662"> He went about his hospitable task. </l>
            <l n="2.663"> My eyes were busy, and my thoughts no less, </l>
            <l n="2.664"> And pleased I looked upon my grey-haired Friend, </l>
            <l n="2.665"> As if to thank him; he returned that look, </l>
            <l n="2.666"> Cheered, plainly, and yet serious. What a wreck </l>
            <l n="2.667"> Had we about us! scattered was the floor, </l>
            <l n="2.668"> And, in like sort, chair, window-seat, and shelf, </l>
            <l n="2.669"> With books, maps, fossils, withered plants and flowers, </l>
            <l n="2.670"> And tufts of mountain moss. Mechanic tools </l>
            <l n="2.671"> Lay intermixed with scraps of paper, some </l>
            <l n="2.672"> Scribbled with verse: a broken angling-rod </l>
            <l n="2.673"> And shattered telescope, together linked </l>
            <l n="2.674"> By cobwebs, stood within a dusty nook; </l>
            <l n="2.675"> And instruments of music, some half-made, </l>
            <l n="2.676"> Some in disgrace, hung dangling from the walls. </l>
            <l n="2.677"> But speedily the promise was fulfilled; </l>
            <l n="2.678"> A feast before us, and a courteous Host </l>
            <l n="2.679"> Inviting us in glee to sit and eat. </l>
            <l n="2.680"> A napkin, white as foam of that rough brook </l>
            <l n="2.681"> By which it had been bleached, o'erspread the board; </l>
            <l n="2.682"> And was itself half-covered with a store </l>
            <l n="2.683"> Of dainties,—oaten bread, curd, cheese, and cream; </l>
            <l n="2.684"> And cakes of butter curiously embossed, </l>
            <l n="2.685"> Butter that had imbibed from meadow-flowers </l>
            <l n="2.686"> A golden hue, delicate as their own </l>
            <l n="2.687"> Faintly reflected in a lingering stream. </l>
            <l n="2.688"> Nor lacked, for more delight on that warm day, </l>
            <l n="2.689"> Our table, small parade of garden fruits, </l>
            <l n="2.690"> And whortle-berries from the mountain side. </l>
            <l n="2.691"> The Child, who long ere this had stilled his sobs, </l>
            <l n="2.692"> Was now a help to his late comforter, </l>
            <l n="2.693"> And moved, a willing Page, as he was bid, </l>
            <l n="2.694"> Ministering to our need. </l>
            <l n="2.695">                           In genial mood, </l>
            <l n="2.696"> While at our pastoral banquet thus we sate </l>
            <l n="2.697"> Fronting the window of that little cell, </l>
            <l n="2.698"> I could not, ever and anon, forbear </l>
            <l n="2.699"> To glance an upward look on two huge Peaks </l>
            <l n="2.700"> That from some other vale peered into this. </l>
            <l n="2.701"> “Those lusty twins,” exclaimed our host, “if here </l>
            <l n="2.702"> It were your lot to dwell, would soon become </l>
            <l n="2.703"> Your prized companions.—Many are the notes </l>
            <l n="2.704"> Which, in his tuneful course, the wind draws forth </l>
            <l n="2.705"> From rocks, woods, caverns, heaths, and dashing shores; </l>
            <l n="2.706"> And well those lofty brethren bear their part </l>
            <l n="2.707"> In the wild concert—chiefly when the storm </l>
            <l n="2.708"> Rides high; then all the upper air they fill </l>
            <l n="2.709"> With roaring sound, that ceases not to flow, </l>
            <l n="2.710"> Like smoke, along the level of the blast, </l>
            <l n="2.711"> In mighty current; theirs, too, is the song </l>
            <l n="2.712"> Of stream and headlong flood that seldom fails; </l>
            <l n="2.713"> And, in the grim and breathless hour of noon, </l>
            <l n="2.714"> Methinks that I have heard them echo back </l>
            <l n="2.715"> The thunder's greeting. Nor have nature's laws </l>
            <l n="2.716"> Left them ungifted with a power to yield </l>
            <l n="2.717"> Music of finer tone; a harmony, </l>
            <l n="2.718"> So do I call it, though it be the hand </l>
            <l n="2.719"> Of silence, though there be no voice;—the clouds, </l>
            <l n="2.720"> The mist, the shadows, light of golden suns, </l>
            <l n="2.721"> Motions of moonlight, all come thither—touch, </l>
            <l n="2.722"> And have an answer—thither come, and shape </l>
            <l n="2.723"> A language not unwelcome to sick hearts </l>
            <l n="2.724"> And idle spirits:—there the sun himself, </l>
            <l n="2.725"> At the calm close of summer's longest day, </l>
            <l n="2.726"> Rests his substantial orb;—between those heights </l>
            <l n="2.727"> And on the top of either pinnacle, </l>
            <l n="2.728"> More keenly than elsewhere in night's blue vault, </l>
            <l n="2.729"> Sparkle the stars, as of their station proud. </l>
            <l n="2.730"> Thoughts are not busier in the mind of man </l>
            <l n="2.731"> Than the mute agents stirring there:—alone </l>
            <l n="2.732"> Here do I sit and watch——” </l>
            <l n="2.733">                               A fall of voice, </l>
            <l n="2.734"> Regretted like the nightingale's last note, </l>
            <l n="2.735"> Had scarcely closed this high-wrought strain of rapture </l>
            <l n="2.736"> Ere with inviting smile the Wanderer said: </l>
            <l n="2.737"> “Now for the tale with which you threatened us!” </l>
            <l n="2.738"> “In truth the threat escaped me unawares: </l>
            <l n="2.739"> Should the tale tire you, let this challenge stand </l>
            <l n="2.740"> For my excuse. Dissevered from mankind, </l>
            <l n="2.741"> As to your eyes and thoughts we must have seemed </l>
            <l n="2.742"> When ye looked down upon us from the crag, </l>
            <l n="2.743"> Islanders 'mid a stormy mountain sea, </l>
            <l n="2.744"> We are not so;—perpetually we touch </l>
            <l n="2.745"> Upon the vulgar ordinances of the world; </l>
            <l n="2.746"> And he, whom this our cottage hath to-day </l>
            <l n="2.747"> Relinquished, lived dependent for his bread </l>
            <l n="2.748"> Upon the laws of public charity. </l>
            <l n="2.749"> The Housewife, tempted by such slender gains </l>
            <l n="2.750"> As might from that occasion be distilled, </l>
            <l n="2.751"> Opened, as she before had done for me, </l>
            <l n="2.752"> Her doors to admit this homeless Pensioner; </l>
            <l n="2.753"> The portion gave of coarse but wholesome fare </l>
            <l n="2.754"> Which appetite required—a blind dull nook, </l>
            <l n="2.755"> Such as she had, the 'kennel' of his rest! </l>
            <l n="2.756"> This, in itself not ill, would yet have been </l>
            <l n="2.757"> Ill borne in earlier life; but his was now </l>
            <l n="2.758"> The still contentedness of seventy years. </l>
            <l n="2.759"> Calm did he sit under the wide-spread tree </l>
            <l n="2.760"> Of his old age: and yet less calm and meek, </l>
            <l n="2.761"> Winningly meek or venerably calm, </l>
            <l n="2.762"> Than slow and torpid; paying in this wise </l>
            <l n="2.763"> A penalty, if penalty it were, </l>
            <l n="2.764"> For spendthrift feats, excesses of his prime. </l>
            <l n="2.765"> I loved the old Man, for I pitied him! </l>
            <l n="2.766"> A task it was, I own, to hold discourse </l>
            <l n="2.767"> With one so slow in gathering up his thoughts, </l>
            <l n="2.768"> But he was a cheap pleasure to my eyes; </l>
            <l n="2.769"> Mild, inoffensive, ready in 'his' way, </l>
            <l n="2.770"> And helpful to his utmost power: and there </l>
            <l n="2.771"> Our housewife knew full well what she possessed! </l>
            <l n="2.772"> He was her vassal of all labour, tilled </l>
            <l n="2.773"> Her garden, from the pasture fetched her kine; </l>
            <l n="2.774"> And, one among the orderly array </l>
            <l n="2.775"> Of hay-makers, beneath the burning sun </l>
            <l n="2.776"> Maintained his place; or heedfully pursued </l>
            <l n="2.777"> His course, on errands bound, to other vales, </l>
            <l n="2.778"> Leading sometimes an inexperienced child </l>
            <l n="2.779"> Too young for any profitable task. </l>
            <l n="2.780"> So moved he like a shadow that performed </l>
            <l n="2.781"> Substantial service. Mark me now, and learn </l>
            <l n="2.782"> For what reward!—The moon her monthly round </l>
            <l n="2.783"> Hath not completed since our dame, the queen </l>
            <l n="2.784"> Of this one cottage and this lonely dale, </l>
            <l n="2.785"> Into my little sanctuary rushed— </l>
            <l n="2.786"> Voice to a rueful treble humanized, </l>
            <l n="2.787"> And features in deplorable dismay. </l>
            <l n="2.788"> I treat the matter lightly, but, alas! </l>
            <l n="2.789"> It is most serious: persevering rain </l>
            <l n="2.790"> Had fallen in torrents; all the mountain tops </l>
            <l n="2.791"> Were hidden, and black vapours coursed their sides; </l>
            <l n="2.792"> This had I seen, and saw; but, till she spake, </l>
            <l n="2.793"> Was wholly ignorant that my ancient Friend— </l>
            <l n="2.794"> Who at her bidding, early and alone, </l>
            <l n="2.795"> Had clomb aloft to delve the moorland turf </l>
            <l n="2.796"> For winter fuel—to his noontide meal </l>
            <l n="2.797"> Returned not, and now, haply, on the heights </l>
            <l n="2.798"> Lay at the mercy of this raging storm. </l>
            <l n="2.799"> 'Inhuman!'—said I 'was an old Man's life </l>
            <l n="2.800"> Not worth the trouble of a thought?—alas! </l>
            <l n="2.801"> This notice comes too late.' With joy I saw </l>
            <l n="2.802"> Her husband enter—from a distant vale. </l>
            <l n="2.803"> We sallied forth together; found the tools </l>
            <l n="2.804"> Which the neglected veteran had dropped, </l>
            <l n="2.805"> But through all quarters looked for him in vain. </l>
            <l n="2.806"> We shouted—but no answer! Darkness fell </l>
            <l n="2.807"> Without remission of the blast or shower, </l>
            <l n="2.808"> And fears for our own safety drove us home. </l>
            <l n="2.809">   I, who weep little, did, I will confess, </l>
            <l n="2.810"> The moment I was seated here alone, </l>
            <l n="2.811"> Honour my little cell with some few tears </l>
            <l n="2.812"> Which anger and resentment could not dry. </l>
            <l n="2.813"> All night the storm endured; and, soon as help </l>
            <l n="2.814"> Had been collected from the neighbouring vale, </l>
            <l n="2.815"> With morning we renewed our quest: the wind </l>
            <l n="2.816"> Was fallen, the rain abated, but the hills </l>
            <l n="2.817"> Lay shrouded in impenetrable mist; </l>
            <l n="2.818"> And long and hopelessly we sought in vain: </l>
            <l n="2.819"> Till, chancing on that lofty ridge to pass </l>
            <l n="2.820"> A heap of ruin—almost without walls </l>
            <l n="2.821"> And wholly without roof (the bleached remains </l>
            <l n="2.822"> Of a small chapel, where, in ancient time, </l>
            <l n="2.823"> The peasants of these lonely valleys used </l>
            <l n="2.824"> To meet for worship on that central height)— </l>
            <l n="2.825"> We there espied the object of our search, </l>
            <l n="2.826"> Lying full three parts buried among tufts </l>
            <l n="2.827"> Of heath-plant, under and above him strewn, </l>
            <l n="2.828"> To baffle, as he might, the watery storm: </l>
            <l n="2.829"> And there we found him breathing peaceably, </l>
            <l n="2.830"> Snug as a child that hides itself in sport </l>
            <l n="2.831"> 'Mid a green hay-cock in a sunny field. </l>
            <l n="2.832"> We spake—he made reply, but would not stir </l>
            <l n="2.833"> At our entreaty; less from want of power </l>
            <l n="2.834"> Than apprehension and bewildering thoughts. </l>
            <l n="2.835">   So was he lifted gently from the ground, </l>
            <l n="2.836"> And with their freight homeward the shepherds moved </l>
            <l n="2.837"> Through the dull mist, I following—when a step, </l>
            <l n="2.838"> A single step, that freed me from the skirts </l>
            <l n="2.839"> Of the blind vapour, opened to my view </l>
            <l n="2.840"> Glory beyond all glory ever seen </l>
            <l n="2.841"> By waking sense or by the dreaming soul! </l>
            <l n="2.842"> The appearance, instantaneously disclosed, </l>
            <l n="2.843"> Was of a mighty city—boldly say </l>
            <l n="2.844"> A wilderness of building, sinking far </l>
            <l n="2.845"> And self-withdrawn into a boundless depth, </l>
            <l n="2.846"> Far sinking into splendour—without end! </l>
            <l n="2.847"> Fabric it seemed of diamond and of gold, </l>
            <l n="2.848"> With alabaster domes, and silver spires, </l>
            <l n="2.849"> And blazing terrace upon terrace, high </l>
            <l n="2.850"> Uplifted; here, serene pavilions bright, </l>
            <l n="2.851"> In avenues disposed; there, towers begirt </l>
            <l n="2.852"> With battlements that on their restless fronts </l>
            <l n="2.853"> Bore stars—illumination of all gems! </l>
            <l n="2.854"> By earthly nature had the effect been wrought </l>
            <l n="2.855"> Upon the dark materials of the storm </l>
            <l n="2.856"> Now pacified; on them, and on the coves </l>
            <l n="2.857"> And mountain-steeps and summits, whereunto </l>
            <l n="2.858"> The vapours had receded, taking there </l>
            <l n="2.859"> Their station under a cerulean sky. </l>
            <l n="2.860"> Oh, 'twas an unimaginable sight! </l>
            <l n="2.861"> Clouds, mists, streams, watery rocks and emerald turf, </l>
            <l n="2.862"> Clouds of all tincture, rocks and sapphire sky, </l>
            <l n="2.863"> Confused, commingled, mutually inflamed, </l>
            <l n="2.864"> Molten together, and composing thus, </l>
            <l n="2.865"> Each lost in each, that marvellous array </l>
            <l n="2.866"> Of temple, palace, citadel, and huge </l>
            <l n="2.867"> Fantastic pomp of structure without name, </l>
            <l n="2.868"> In fleecy folds voluminous, enwrapped. </l>
            <l n="2.869"> Right in the midst, where interspace appeared </l>
            <l n="2.870"> Of open court, an object like a throne </l>
            <l n="2.871"> Under a shining canopy of state </l>
            <l n="2.872"> Stood fixed; and fixed resemblances were seen </l>
            <l n="2.873"> To implements of ordinary use, </l>
            <l n="2.874"> But vast in size, in substance glorified; </l>
            <l n="2.875"> Such as by Hebrew Prophets were beheld </l>
            <l n="2.876"> In vision—forms uncouth of mightiest power </l>
            <l n="2.877"> For admiration and mysterious awe. </l>
            <l n="2.878"> This little Vale, a dwelling-place of Man, </l>
            <l n="2.879"> Lay low beneath my feet; 'twas visible— </l>
            <l n="2.880"> I saw not, but I felt that it was there. </l>
            <l n="2.881"> That which I 'saw' was the revealed abode </l>
            <l n="2.882"> Of Spirits in beatitude: my heart </l>
            <l n="2.883"> Swelled in my breast—'I have been dead,' I cried, </l>
            <l n="2.884"> 'And now I live! Oh! wherefore 'do' I live?' </l>
            <l n="2.885"> And with that pang I prayed to be no more!— </l>
            <l n="2.886"> —But I forget our Charge, as utterly </l>
            <l n="2.887"> I then forgot him:—there I stood and gazed: </l>
            <l n="2.888"> The apparition faded not away, </l>
            <l n="2.889"> And I descended. </l>
            <l n="2.890">                   Having reached the house, </l>
            <l n="2.891"> I found its rescued inmate safely lodged, </l>
            <l n="2.892"> And in serene possession of himself, </l>
            <l n="2.893"> Beside a fire whose genial warmth seemed met </l>
            <l n="2.894"> By a faint shining from the heart, a gleam, </l>
            <l n="2.895"> Of comfort, spread over his pallid face. </l>
            <l n="2.896"> Great show of joy the housewife made, and truly </l>
            <l n="2.897"> Was glad to find her conscience set at ease; </l>
            <l n="2.898"> And not less glad, for sake of her good name, </l>
            <l n="2.899"> That the poor Sufferer had escaped with life. </l>
            <l n="2.900"> But, though he seemed at first to have received </l>
            <l n="2.901"> No harm, and uncomplaining as before </l>
            <l n="2.902"> Went through his usual tasks, a silent change </l>
            <l n="2.903"> Soon showed itself: he lingered three short weeks; </l>
            <l n="2.904"> And from the cottage hath been borne to-day. </l>
            <l n="2.905">   So ends my dolorous tale, and glad I am </l>
            <l n="2.906"> That it is ended.” At these words he turned— </l>
            <l n="2.907"> And, with blithe air of open fellowship, </l>
            <l n="2.908"> Brought from the cupboard wine and stouter cheer, </l>
            <l n="2.909"> Like one who would be merry. Seeing this, </l>
            <l n="2.910"> My grey-haired Friend said courteously—“Nay, nay, </l>
            <l n="2.911"> You have regaled us as a hermit ought; </l>
            <l n="2.912"> Now let us forth into the sun!”—Our Host </l>
            <l n="2.913"> Rose, though reluctantly, and forth we went. </l>

</p>
            <l n="3.1"> A HUMMING BEE—a little tinkling rill— </l>
            <l n="3.2"> A pair of falcons wheeling on the wing, </l>
            <l n="3.3"> In clamorous agitation, round the crest </l>
            <l n="3.4"> Of a tall rock, their airy citadel— </l>
            <l n="3.5"> By each and all of these the pensive ear </l>
            <l n="3.6"> Was greeted, in the silence that ensued, </l>
            <l n="3.7"> When through the cottage-threshold we had passed, </l>
            <l n="3.8"> And, deep within that lonesome valley, stood </l>
            <l n="3.9"> Once more beneath the concave of a blue </l>
            <l n="3.10"> And cloudless sky.—Anon exclaimed our Host— </l>
            <l n="3.11"> Triumphantly dispersing with the taunt </l>
            <l n="3.12"> The shade of discontent which on his brow </l>
            <l n="3.13"> Had gathered,—“Ye have left my cell,—but see </l>
            <l n="3.14"> How Nature hems you in with friendly arms! </l>
            <l n="3.15"> And by her help ye are my prisoners still. </l>
            <l n="3.16"> But which way shall I lead you?—how contrive, </l>
            <l n="3.17"> In spot so parsimoniously endowed, </l>
            <l n="3.18"> That the brief hours, which yet remain, may reap </l>
            <l n="3.19"> Some recompense of knowledge or delight?” </l>
            <l n="3.20"> So saying, round he looked, as if perplexed; </l>
            <l n="3.21"> And, to remove those doubts, my grey-haired Friend </l>
            <l n="3.22"> Said—“Shall we take this pathway for our guide?— </l>
            <l n="3.23"> Upward it winds, as if, in summer heats, </l>
            <l n="3.24"> Its line had first been fashioned by the flock </l>
            <l n="3.25"> Seeking a place of refuge at the root </l>
            <l n="3.26"> Of yon black Yew-tree, whose protruded boughs </l>
            <l n="3.27"> Darken the silver bosom of the crag, </l>
            <l n="3.28"> From which she draws her meagre sustenance. </l>
            <l n="3.29"> There in commodious shelter may we rest. </l>
            <l n="3.30"> Or let us trace this streamlet to its source; </l>
            <l n="3.31"> Feebly it tinkles with an earthy sound, </l>
            <l n="3.32"> And a few steps may bring us to the spot </l>
            <l n="3.33"> Where, haply, crowned with flowerets and green herbs, </l>
            <l n="3.34"> The mountain infant to the sun comes forth, </l>
            <l n="3.35"> Like human life from darkness.”—A quick turn </l>
            <l n="3.36"> Through a strait passage of encumbered ground, </l>
            <l n="3.37"> Proved that such hope was vain:—for now we stood </l>
            <l n="3.38"> Shut out from prospect of the open vale, </l>
            <l n="3.39"> And saw the water, that composed this rill, </l>
            <l n="3.40"> Descending, disembodied, and diffused </l>
            <l n="3.41"> O'er the smooth surface of an ample crag, </l>
            <l n="3.42"> Lofty, and steep, and naked as a tower. </l>
            <l n="3.43"> All further progress here was barred;—And who, </l>
            <l n="3.44"> Thought I, if master of a vacant hour, </l>
            <l n="3.45"> Here would not linger, willingly detained? </l>
            <l n="3.46"> Whether to such wild objects he were led </l>
            <l n="3.47"> When copious rains have magnified the stream </l>
            <l n="3.48"> Into a loud and white-robed waterfall, </l>
            <l n="3.49"> Or introduced at this more quiet time. </l>
            <l n="3.50">   Upon a semicirque of turf-clad ground, </l>
            <l n="3.51"> The hidden nook discovered to our view </l>
            <l n="3.52"> A mass of rock, resembling, as it lay </l>
            <l n="3.53"> Right at the foot of that moist precipice, </l>
            <l n="3.54"> A stranded ship, with keel upturned, that rests </l>
            <l n="3.55"> Fearless of winds and waves. Three several stones </l>
            <l n="3.56"> Stood near, of smaller size, and not unlike </l>
            <l n="3.57"> To monumental pillars: and, from these </l>
            <l n="3.58"> Some little space disjoined a pair were seen, </l>
            <l n="3.59"> That with united shoulders bore aloft </l>
            <l n="3.60"> A fragment, like an altar, flat and smooth: </l>
            <l n="3.61"> Barren the tablet, yet thereon appeared </l>
            <l n="3.62"> A tall and shining holly, that had found </l>
            <l n="3.63"> A hospitable chink, and stood upright, </l>
            <l n="3.64"> As if inserted by some human hand </l>
            <l n="3.65"> In mockery, to wither in the sun, </l>
            <l n="3.66"> Or lay its beauty flat before a breeze, </l>
            <l n="3.67"> The first that entered. But no breeze did now </l>
            <l n="3.68"> Find entrance;—high or low appeared no trace </l>
            <l n="3.69"> Of motion, save the water that descended, </l>
            <l n="3.70"> Diffused adown that barrier of steep rock, </l>
            <l n="3.71"> And softly creeping, like a breath of air, </l>
            <l n="3.72"> Such as is sometimes seen, and hardly seen, </l>
            <l n="3.73"> To brush the still breast of a crystal lake. </l>
            <l n="3.74">   “Behold a cabinet for sages built, </l>
            <l n="3.75"> Which kings might envy!”—Praise to this effect </l>
            <l n="3.76"> Broke from the happy old Man's reverend lip; </l>
            <l n="3.77"> Who to the Solitary turned, and said, </l>
            <l n="3.78"> “In sooth, with love's familiar privilege, </l>
            <l n="3.79"> You have decried the wealth which is your own. </l>
            <l n="3.80"> Among these rocks and stones, methinks, I see </l>
            <l n="3.81"> More than the heedless impress that belongs </l>
            <l n="3.82"> To lonely nature's casual work: they bear </l>
            <l n="3.83"> A semblance strange of power intelligent, </l>
            <l n="3.84"> And of design not wholly worn away. </l>
            <l n="3.85"> Boldest of plants that ever faced the wind, </l>
            <l n="3.86"> How gracefully that slender shrub looks forth </l>
            <l n="3.87"> From its fantastic birth-place! And I own, </l>
            <l n="3.88"> Some shadowy intimations haunt me here, </l>
            <l n="3.89"> That in these shows a chronicle survives </l>
            <l n="3.90"> Of purposes akin to those of Man, </l>
            <l n="3.91"> But wrought with mightier arm than now prevails. </l>
            <l n="3.92"> —Voiceless the stream descends into the gulf </l>
            <l n="3.93"> With timid lapse;—and lo! while in this strait </l>
            <l n="3.94"> I stand—the chasm of sky above my head </l>
            <l n="3.95"> Is heaven's profoundest azure; no domain </l>
            <l n="3.96"> For fickle, short-lived clouds to occupy, </l>
            <l n="3.97"> Or to pass through; but rather an abyss </l>
            <l n="3.98"> In which the everlasting stars abide; </l>
            <l n="3.99"> And whose soft gloom, and boundless depth, might tempt </l>
            <l n="3.100"> The curious eye to look for them by day. </l>
            <l n="3.101"> —Hail Contemplation! from the stately towers, </l>
            <l n="3.102"> Reared by the industrious hand of human art </l>
            <l n="3.103"> To lift thee high above the misty air </l>
            <l n="3.104"> And turbulence of murmuring cities vast; </l>
            <l n="3.105"> From academic groves, that have for thee </l>
            <l n="3.106"> Been planted, hither come and find a lodge </l>
            <l n="3.107"> To which thou mayst resort for holier peace,— </l>
            <l n="3.108"> From whose calm centre thou, through height or depth, </l>
            <l n="3.109"> Mayst penetrate, wherever truth shall lead; </l>
            <l n="3.110"> Measuring through all degrees, until the scale </l>
            <l n="3.111"> Of time and conscious nature disappear, </l>
            <l n="3.112"> Lost in unsearchable eternity!” </l>
            <l n="3.113">   A pause ensued; and with minuter care </l>
            <l n="3.114"> We scanned the various features of the scene: </l>
            <l n="3.115"> And soon the Tenant of that lonely vale </l>
            <l n="3.116"> With courteous voice thus spake— </l>
            <l n="3.117">                                    “I should have grieved </l>
            <l n="3.118"> Hereafter, not escaping self-reproach, </l>
            <l n="3.119"> If from my poor retirement ye had gone </l>
            <l n="3.120"> Leaving this nook unvisited: but, in sooth, </l>
            <l n="3.121"> Your unexpected presence had so roused </l>
            <l n="3.122"> My spirits, that they were bent on enterprise; </l>
            <l n="3.123"> And, like an ardent hunter, I forgot, </l>
            <l n="3.124"> Or, shall I say?—disdained, the game that lurks </l>
            <l n="3.125"> At my own door. The shapes before our eyes </l>
            <l n="3.126"> And their arrangement, doubtless must be deemed </l>
            <l n="3.127"> The sport of Nature, aided by blind Chance </l>
            <l n="3.128"> Rudely to mock the works of toiling Man. </l>
            <l n="3.129"> And hence, this upright shaft of unhewn stone, </l>
            <l n="3.130"> From Fancy, willing to set off her stores </l>
            <l n="3.131"> By sounding titles, hath acquired the name </l>
            <l n="3.132"> Of Pompey's pillar; that I gravely style </l>
            <l n="3.133"> My Theban obelisk; and, there, behold </l>
            <l n="3.134"> A Druid cromlech!—thus I entertain </l>
            <l n="3.135"> The antiquarian humour, and am pleased </l>
            <l n="3.136"> To skim along the surfaces of things, </l>
            <l n="3.137"> Beguiling harmlessly the listless hours. </l>
            <l n="3.138"> But if the spirit be oppressed by sense </l>
            <l n="3.139"> Of instability, revolt, decay, </l>
            <l n="3.140"> And change, and emptiness, these freaks of Nature </l>
            <l n="3.141"> And her blind helper Chance, do 'then' suffice </l>
            <l n="3.142"> To quicken, and to aggravate—to feed </l>
            <l n="3.143"> Pity and scorn, and melancholy pride, </l>
            <l n="3.144"> Not less than that huge Pile (from some abyss </l>
            <l n="3.145"> Of mortal power unquestionably sprung) </l>
            <l n="3.146"> Whose hoary diadem of pendent rocks </l>
            <l n="3.147"> Confines the shrill-voiced whirlwind, round and round </l>
            <l n="3.148"> Eddying within its vast circumference, </l>
            <l n="3.149"> On Sarum's naked plain—than pyramid </l>
            <l n="3.150"> Of Egypt, unsubverted, undissolved— </l>
            <l n="3.151"> Or Syria's marble ruins towering high </l>
            <l n="3.152"> Above the sandy desert, in the light </l>
            <l n="3.153"> Of sun or moon.—Forgive me, if I say </l>
            <l n="3.154"> That an appearance which hath raised your minds </l>
            <l n="3.155"> To an exalted pitch (the self-same cause </l>
            <l n="3.156"> Different effect producing) is for me </l>
            <l n="3.157"> Fraught rather with depression than delight, </l>
            <l n="3.158"> Though shame it were, could I not look around, </l>
            <l n="3.159"> By the reflection of your pleasure, pleased. </l>
            <l n="3.160"> Yet happier in my judgment, even than you </l>
            <l n="3.161"> With your bright transports fairly may be deemed, </l>
            <l n="3.162"> The wandering Herbalist,—who, clear alike </l>
            <l n="3.163"> From vain, and, that worse evil, vexing thoughts, </l>
            <l n="3.164"> Casts, if he ever chance to enter here, </l>
            <l n="3.165"> Upon these uncouth Forms a slight regard </l>
            <l n="3.166"> Of transitory interest, and peeps round </l>
            <l n="3.167"> For some rare floweret of the hills, or plant </l>
            <l n="3.168"> Of craggy fountain; what he hopes for wins, </l>
            <l n="3.169"> Or learns, at least, that 'tis not to be won: </l>
            <l n="3.170"> Then, keen and eager, as a fine-nosed hound, </l>
            <l n="3.171"> By soul-engrossing instinct driven along </l>
            <l n="3.172"> Through wood or open field, the harmless Man </l>
            <l n="3.173"> Departs, intent upon his onward quest!— </l>
            <l n="3.174"> Nor is that Fellow-wanderer, so deem I, </l>
            <l n="3.175"> Less to be envied, (you may trace him oft </l>
            <l n="3.176"> By scars which his activity has left </l>
            <l n="3.177"> Beside our roads and pathways, though, thank Heaven! </l>
            <l n="3.178"> This covert nook reports not of his hand) </l>
            <l n="3.179"> He who with pocket-hammer smites the edge </l>
            <l n="3.180"> Of luckless rock or prominent stone, disguised </l>
            <l n="3.181"> In weather-stains or crusted o'er by Nature </l>
            <l n="3.182"> With her first growths, detaching by the stroke </l>

            <l n="3.413"> From the unqualified disdain, that once </l>
            <l n="3.414"> Would have been cast upon them by my voice </l>
            <l n="3.415"> Delivering her decisions from the seat </l>
            <l n="3.416"> Of forward youth—that scruples not to solve </l>
            <l n="3.417"> Doubts, and determine questions, by the rules </l>
            <l n="3.418"> Of inexperienced judgment, ever prone </l>
            <l n="3.419"> To overweening faith; and is inflamed, </l>
            <l n="3.420"> By courage, to demand from real life </l>
            <l n="3.421"> The test of act and suffering, to provoke </l>
            <l n="3.422"> Hostility—how dreadful when it comes, </l>
            <l n="3.423"> Whether affliction be the foe, or guilt! </l>
            <l n="3.424">   A child of earth, I rested, in that stage </l>
            <l n="3.425"> Of my past course to which these thoughts advert, </l>
            <l n="3.426"> Upon earth's native energies; forgetting </l>
            <l n="3.427"> That mine was a condition which required </l>
            <l n="3.428"> Nor energy, nor fortitude—a calm </l>
            <l n="3.429"> Without vicissitude; which, if the like </l>
            <l n="3.430"> Had been presented to my view elsewhere, </l>
            <l n="3.431"> I might have even been tempted to despise. </l>
            <l n="3.432"> But no—for the serene was also bright; </l>
            <l n="3.433"> Enlivened happiness with joy o'erflowing, </l>
            <l n="3.434"> With joy, and—oh! that memory should survive </l>
            <l n="3.435"> To speak the word—with rapture! Nature's boon, </l>
            <l n="3.436"> Life's genuine inspiration, happiness </l>
            <l n="3.437"> Above what rules can teach, or fancy feign; </l>
            <l n="3.438"> Abused, as all possessions 'are' abused </l>
            <l n="3.439"> That are not prized according to their worth. </l>
            <l n="3.440"> And yet, what worth? what good is given to men, </l>
            <l n="3.441"> More solid than the gilded clouds of heaven? </l>
            <l n="3.442"> What joy more lasting than a vernal flower?— </l>
            <l n="3.443"> None! 'tis the general plaint of human kind </l>
            <l n="3.444"> In solitude: and mutually addressed </l>
            <l n="3.445"> From each to all, for wisdom's sake:—This truth </l>
            <l n="3.446"> The priest announces from his holy seat: </l>
            <l n="3.447"> And, crowned with garlands in the summer grove, </l>
            <l n="3.448"> The poet fits it to his pensive lyre. </l>
            <l n="3.449"> Yet, ere that final resting-place be gained, </l>
            <l n="3.450"> Sharp contradictions may arise, by doom </l>
            <l n="3.451"> Of this same life, compelling us to grieve </l>
            <l n="3.452"> That the prosperities of love and joy </l>
            <l n="3.453"> Should be permitted, oft-times, to endure </l>
            <l n="3.454"> So long, and be at once cast down for ever. </l>
            <l n="3.455"> Oh! tremble, ye, to whom hath been assigned </l>
            <l n="3.456"> A course of days composing happy months, </l>
            <l n="3.457"> And they as happy years; the present still </l>
            <l n="3.458"> So like the past, and both so firm a pledge </l>
            <l n="3.459"> Of a congenial future, that the wheels </l>
            <l n="3.460"> Of pleasure move without the aid of hope: </l>
            <l n="3.461"> For Mutability is Nature's bane; </l>
            <l n="3.462"> And slighted Hope 'will' be avenged; and, when </l>
            <l n="3.463"> Ye need her favours, ye shall find her not; </l>
            <l n="3.464"> But in her stead—fear—doubt—and agony!” </l>
            <l n="3.465">   This was the bitter language of the heart: </l>
            <l n="3.466"> But, while he spake, look, gesture, tone of voice, </l>
            <l n="3.467"> Though discomposed and vehement, were such </l>
            <l n="3.468"> As skill and graceful nature might suggest </l>
            <l n="3.469"> To a proficient of the tragic scene </l>
            <l n="3.470"> Standing before the multitude, beset </l>
            <l n="3.471"> With dark events. Desirous to divert </l>
            <l n="3.472"> Or stem the current of the speaker's thoughts, </l>
            <l n="3.473"> We signified a wish to leave that place </l>
            <l n="3.474"> Of stillness and close privacy, a nook </l>
            <l n="3.475"> That seemed for self-examination made; </l>
            <l n="3.476"> Or, for confession, in the sinner's need, </l>
            <l n="3.477"> Hidden from all men's view. To our attempt </l>
            <l n="3.478"> He yielded not; but, pointing to a slope </l>
            <l n="3.479"> Of mossy turf defended from the sun, </l>
            <l n="3.480"> And on that couch inviting us to rest, </l>
            <l n="3.481"> Full on that tender-hearted Man he turned </l>
            <l n="3.482"> A serious eye, and his speech thus renewed. </l>
            <l n="3.483">   “You never saw, your eyes did never look </l>
            <l n="3.484"> On the bright form of Her whom once I loved:— </l>
            <l n="3.485"> Her silver voice was heard upon the earth, </l>
            <l n="3.486"> A sound unknown to you; else, honoured Friend! </l>
            <l n="3.487"> Your heart had borne a pitiable share </l>
            <l n="3.488"> Of what I suffered, when I wept that loss, </l>
            <l n="3.489"> And suffer now, not seldom, from the thought </l>
            <l n="3.490"> That I remember, and can weep no more.— </l>
            <l n="3.491"> Stripped as I am of all the golden fruit </l>
            <l n="3.492"> Of self-esteem; and by the cutting blasts </l>
            <l n="3.493"> Of self-reproach familiarly assailed; </l>
            <l n="3.494"> Yet would I not be of such wintry bareness </l>
            <l n="3.495"> But that some leaf of your regard should hang </l>
            <l n="3.496"> Upon my naked branches:—lively thoughts </l>
            <l n="3.497"> Give birth, full often, to unguarded words; </l>
            <l n="3.498"> I grieve that, in your presence, from my tongue </l>
            <l n="3.499"> Too much of frailty hath already dropped; </l>
            <l n="3.500"> But that too much demands still more. </l>
            <l n="3.501">                                        You know, </l>
            <l n="3.502"> Revered Compatriot—and to you, kind Sir, </l>
            <l n="3.503"> (Not to be deemed a stranger, as you come </l>
            <l n="3.504"> Following the guidance of these welcome feet </l>
            <l n="3.505"> To our secluded vale) it may be told— </l>
            <l n="3.506"> That my demerits did not sue in vain </l>
            <l n="3.507"> To One on whose mild radiance many gazed </l>
            <l n="3.508"> With hope, and all with pleasure. This fair Bride— </l>
            <l n="3.509"> In the devotedness of youthful love, </l>
            <l n="3.510"> Preferring me to parents, and the choir </l>
            <l n="3.511"> Of gay companions, to the natal roof, </l>
            <l n="3.512"> And all known places and familiar sights </l>
            <l n="3.513"> (Resigned with sadness gently weighing down </l>
            <l n="3.514"> Her trembling expectations, but no more </l>
            <l n="3.515"> Than did to her due honour, and to me </l>
            <l n="3.516"> Yielded, that day, a confidence sublime </l>
            <l n="3.517"> In what I had to build upon)—this Bride, </l>
            <l n="3.518"> Young, modest, meek, and beautiful, I led </l>
            <l n="3.519"> To a low cottage in a sunny bay, </l>
            <l n="3.520"> Where the salt sea innocuously breaks, </l>
            <l n="3.521"> And the sea breeze as innocently breathes, </l>
            <l n="3.522"> On Devon's leafy shores;—a sheltered hold, </l>
            <l n="3.523"> In a soft clime encouraging the soil </l>
            <l n="3.524"> To a luxuriant bounty!—As our steps </l>
            <l n="3.525"> Approach the embowered abode—our chosen seat— </l>
            <l n="3.526"> See, rooted in the earth, her kindly bed, </l>
            <l n="3.527"> The unendangered myrtle, decked with flowers, </l>
            <l n="3.528"> Before the threshold stands to welcome us! </l>
            <l n="3.529"> While, in the flowering myrtle's neighbourhood, </l>
            <l n="3.530"> Not overlooked but courting no regard, </l>
            <l n="3.531"> Those native plants, the holly and the yew, </l>
            <l n="3.532"> Gave modest intimation to the mind </l>
            <l n="3.533"> How willingly their aid they would unite </l>
            <l n="3.534"> With the green myrtle, to endear the hours </l>
            <l n="3.535"> Of winter, and protect that pleasant place. </l>
            <l n="3.536"> —Wild were the walks upon those lonely Downs, </l>
            <l n="3.537"> Track leading into track; how marked, how worn </l>
            <l n="3.538"> Into bright verdure, between fern and gorse </l>
            <l n="3.539"> Winding away its never-ending line </l>
            <l n="3.540"> On their smooth surface, evidence was none; </l>
            <l n="3.541"> But, there, lay open to our daily haunt, </l>
            <l n="3.542"> A range of unappropriated earth, </l>
            <l n="3.543"> Where youth's ambitious feet might move at large; </l>
            <l n="3.544"> Whence, unmolested wanderers, we beheld </l>
            <l n="3.545"> The shining giver of the day diffuse </l>
            <l n="3.546"> His brightness o'er a tract of sea and land </l>
            <l n="3.547"> Gay as our spirits, free as our desires; </l>
            <l n="3.548"> As our enjoyments, boundless.—From those heights </l>
            <l n="3.549"> We dropped, at pleasure, into sylvan combs; </l>
            <l n="3.550"> Where arbours of impenetrable shade, </l>
            <l n="3.551"> And mossy seats, detained us side by side, </l>
            <l n="3.552"> With hearts at ease, and knowledge in our hearts </l>
            <l n="3.553"> 'That all the grove and all the day was ours.' </l>
            <l n="3.554">   O happy time! still happier was at hand; </l>
            <l n="3.555"> For Nature called my Partner to resign </l>
            <l n="3.556"> Her share in the pure freedom of that life, </l>
            <l n="3.557"> Enjoyed by us in common.—To my hope, </l>
            <l n="3.558"> To my heart's wish, my tender Mate became </l>
            <l n="3.559"> The thankful captive of maternal bonds; </l>
            <l n="3.560"> And those wild paths were left to me alone. </l>
            <l n="3.561"> There could I meditate on follies past; </l>
            <l n="3.562"> And, like a weary voyager escaped </l>
            <l n="3.563"> From risk and hardship, inwardly retrace </l>
            <l n="3.564"> A course of vain delights and thoughtless guilt, </l>
            <l n="3.565"> And self-indulgence—without shame pursued. </l>
            <l n="3.566"> There, undisturbed, could think of and could thank </l>
            <l n="3.567"> Her whose submissive spirit was to me </l>
            <l n="3.568"> Rule and restraint—my guardian—shall I say </l>
            <l n="3.569"> That earthly Providence, whose guiding love </l>
            <l n="3.570"> Within a port of rest had lodged me safe; </l>
            <l n="3.571"> Safe from temptation, and from danger far? </l>
            <l n="3.572"> Strains followed of acknowledgment addressed </l>
            <l n="3.573"> To an authority enthroned above </l>
            <l n="3.574"> The reach of sight; from whom, as from their source </l>
            <l n="3.575"> Proceed all visible ministers of good </l>
            <l n="3.576"> That walk the earth—Father of heaven and earth, </l>
            <l n="3.577"> Father, and king, and judge, adored and feared! </l>
            <l n="3.578"> These acts of mind, and memory, and heart, </l>
            <l n="3.579"> And spirit—interrupted and relieved </l>
            <l n="3.580"> By observations transient as the glance </l>
            <l n="3.581"> Of flying sunbeams, or to the outward form </l>
            <l n="3.582"> Cleaving with power inherent and intense, </l>
            <l n="3.583"> As the mute insect fixed upon the plant </l>
            <l n="3.584"> On whose soft leaves it hangs, and from whose cup </l>
            <l n="3.585"> It draws its nourishment imperceptibly— </l>
            <l n="3.586"> Endeared my wanderings; and the mother's kiss </l>
            <l n="3.587"> And infant's smile awaited my return. </l>
            <l n="3.588">   In privacy we dwelt, a wedded pair, </l>
            <l n="3.589"> Companions daily, often all day long; </l>
            <l n="3.590"> Not placed by fortune within easy reach </l>
            <l n="3.591"> Of various intercourse, nor wishing aught </l>
            <l n="3.592"> Beyond the allowance of our own fire-side, </l>
            <l n="3.593"> The twain within our happy cottage born, </l>
            <l n="3.594"> Inmates, and heirs of our united love; </l>
            <l n="3.595"> Graced mutually by difference of sex, </l>
            <l n="3.596"> And with no wider interval of time </l>
            <l n="3.597"> Between their several births than served for one </l>
            <l n="3.598"> To establish something of a leader's sway; </l>
            <l n="3.599"> Yet left them joined by sympathy in age; </l>
            <l n="3.600"> Equals in pleasure, fellows in pursuit. </l>
            <l n="3.601"> On these two pillars rested as in air </l>
            <l n="3.602"> Our solitude. </l>
            <l n="3.603">                It soothes me to perceive, </l>
            <l n="3.604"> Your courtesy withholds not from my words </l>
            <l n="3.605"> Attentive audience. But, oh! gentle Friends, </l>
            <l n="3.606"> As times of quiet and unbroken peace, </l>
            <l n="3.607"> Though, for a nation, times of blessedness, </l>
            <l n="3.608"> Give back faint echoes from the historian's page; </l>
            <l n="3.609"> So, in the imperfect sounds of this discourse, </l>
            <l n="3.610"> Depressed I hear, how faithless is the voice </l>
            <l n="3.611"> Which those most blissful days reverberate. </l>
            <l n="3.612"> What special record can, or need, be given </l>
            <l n="3.613"> To rules and habits, whereby much was done, </l>
            <l n="3.614"> But all within the sphere of little things; </l>
            <l n="3.615"> Of humble, though, to us, important cares, </l>
            <l n="3.616"> And precious interests? Smoothly did our life </l>
            <l n="3.617"> Advance, swerving not from the path prescribed; </l>
            <l n="3.618"> Her annual, her diurnal, round alike! </l>
            <l n="3.619"> Maintained with faithful care. And you divine </l>
            <l n="3.620"> The worst effects that our condition saw </l>
            <l n="3.621"> If you imagine changes slowly wrought, </l>
            <l n="3.622"> And in their progress unperceivable; </l>
            <l n="3.623"> Not wished for; sometimes noticed with a sigh, </l>
            <l n="3.624"> (Whate'er of good or lovely they might bring) </l>
            <l n="3.625"> Sighs of regret, for the familiar good </l>
            <l n="3.626"> And loveliness endeared which they removed. </l>
            <l n="3.627">   Seven years of occupation undisturbed </l>
            <l n="3.628"> Established seemingly a right to hold </l>
            <l n="3.629"> That happiness; and use and habit gave, </l>
            <l n="3.630"> To what an alien spirit had acquired, </l>
            <l n="3.631"> A patrimonial sanctity. And thus, </l>
            <l n="3.632"> With thoughts and wishes bounded to this world, </l>
            <l n="3.633"> I lived and breathed; most grateful—if to enjoy </l>
            <l n="3.634"> Without repining or desire for more, </l>
            <l n="3.635"> For different lot, or change to higher sphere, </l>
            <l n="3.636"> (Only except some impulses of pride </l>
            <l n="3.637"> With no determined object, though upheld </l>
            <l n="3.638"> By theories with suitable support)— </l>
            <l n="3.639"> Most grateful, if in such wise to enjoy </l>
            <l n="3.640"> Be proof of gratitude for what we have; </l>
            <l n="3.641"> Else, I allow, most thankless.—But, at once, </l>
            <l n="3.642"> From some dark seat of fatal power was urged </l>
            <l n="3.643"> A claim that shattered all.—Our blooming girl, </l>
            <l n="3.644"> Caught in the gripe of death, with such brief time </l>
            <l n="3.645"> To struggle in as scarcely would allow </l>
            <l n="3.646"> Her cheek to change its colour, was conveyed </l>
            <l n="3.647"> From us to inaccessible worlds, to regions </l>
            <l n="3.648"> Where height, or depth, admits not the approach </l>
            <l n="3.649"> Of living man, though longing to pursue. </l>
            <l n="3.650"> —With even as brief a warning—and how soon, </l>
            <l n="3.651"> With what short interval of time between, </l>
            <l n="3.652"> I tremble yet to think of—our last prop, </l>
            <l n="3.653"> Our happy life's only remaining stay— </l>
            <l n="3.654"> The brother followed; and was seen no more! </l>
            <l n="3.655">   Calm as a frozen lake when ruthless winds </l>
            <l n="3.656"> Blow fiercely, agitating earth and sky, </l>
            <l n="3.657"> The Mother now remained; as if in her, </l>
            <l n="3.658"> Who, to the lowest region of the soul, </l>
            <l n="3.659"> Had been erewhile unsettled and disturbed, </l>
            <l n="3.660"> This second visitation had no power </l>
            <l n="3.661"> To shake; but only to bind up and seal; </l>
            <l n="3.662"> And to establish thankfulness of heart </l>
            <l n="3.663"> In Heaven's determinations, ever just. </l>
            <l n="3.664"> The eminence whereon her spirit stood, </l>
            <l n="3.665"> Mine was unable to attain. Immense </l>
            <l n="3.666"> The space that severed us! But, as the sight </l>
            <l n="3.667"> Communicates with heaven's ethereal orbs </l>
            <l n="3.668"> Incalculably distant; so, I felt </l>
            <l n="3.669"> That consolation may descend from far </l>
            <l n="3.670"> (And that is intercourse, and union, too,) </l>
            <l n="3.671"> While, overcome with speechless gratitude, </l>
            <l n="3.672"> And, with a holier love inspired, I looked </l>
            <l n="3.673"> On her—at once superior to my woes </l>
            <l n="3.674"> And partner of my loss.—O heavy change, </l>
            <l n="3.675"> Dimness o'er this clear luminary crept </l>
            <l n="3.676"> Insensibly;—the immortal and divine </l>
            <l n="3.677"> Yielded to mortal reflux; her pure glory, </l>
            <l n="3.678"> As from the pinnacle of worldly state </l>
            <l n="3.679"> Wretched ambition drops astounded, fell </l>
            <l n="3.680"> Into a gulf obscure of silent grief, </l>
            <l n="3.681"> And keen heart-anguish—of itself ashamed, </l>
            <l n="3.682"> Yet obstinately cherishing itself: </l>
            <l n="3.683"> And, so consumed, she melted from my arms; </l>
            <l n="3.684"> And left me, on this earth, disconsolate! </l>
            <l n="3.685">   What followed cannot be reviewed in thought; </l>
            <l n="3.686"> Much less, retraced in words. If she, of life </l>
            <l n="3.687"> Blameless, so intimate with love and joy </l>
            <l n="3.688"> And all the tender motions of the soul, </l>
            <l n="3.689"> Had been supplanted, could I hope to stand— </l>
            <l n="3.690"> Infirm, dependent, and now destitute? </l>
            <l n="3.691"> I called on dreams and visions, to disclose </l>
            <l n="3.692"> That which is veiled from waking thought; conjured </l>
            <l n="3.693"> Eternity, as men constrain a ghost </l>
            <l n="3.694"> To appear and answer; to the grave I spake </l>
            <l n="3.695"> Imploringly;—looked up, and asked the Heavens </l>
            <l n="3.696"> If Angels traversed their cerulean floors, </l>
            <l n="3.697"> If fixed or wandering star could tidings yield </l>
            <l n="3.698"> Of the departed spirit—what abode </l>
            <l n="3.699"> It occupies—what consciousness retains </l>
            <l n="3.700"> Of former loves and interests. Then my soul </l>
            <l n="3.701"> Turned inward,—to examine of what stuff </l>
            <l n="3.702"> Time's fetters are composed; and life was put </l>
            <l n="3.703"> To inquisition, long and profitless! </l>
            <l n="3.704"> By pain of heart—now checked—and now impelled— </l>
            <l n="3.705"> The intellectual power, through words and things, </l>
            <l n="3.706"> Went sounding on, a dim and perilous way! </l>
            <l n="3.707"> And from those transports, and these toils abstruse, </l>
            <l n="3.708"> Some trace am I enabled to retain </l>
            <l n="3.709"> Of time, else lost;—existing unto me </l>
            <l n="3.710"> Only by records in myself not found. </l>
            <l n="3.711">   From that abstraction I was roused,—and how? </l>
            <l n="3.712"> Even as a thoughtful shepherd by a flash </l>
            <l n="3.713"> Of lightning startled in a gloomy cave </l>
            <l n="3.714"> Of these wild hills. For, lo! the dread Bastile, </l>
            <l n="3.715"> With all the chambers in its horrid towers, </l>
            <l n="3.716"> Fell to the ground:—by violence overthrown </l>
            <l n="3.717"> Of indignation; and with shouts that drowned </l>
            <l n="3.718"> The crash it made in falling! From the wreck </l>
            <l n="3.719"> A golden palace rose, or seemed to rise, </l>
            <l n="3.720"> The appointed seat of equitable law </l>
            <l n="3.721"> And mild paternal sway. The potent shock </l>
            <l n="3.722"> I felt: the transformation I perceived, </l>
            <l n="3.723"> As marvellously seized as in that moment </l>
            <l n="3.724"> When, from the blind mist issuing, I beheld </l>
            <l n="3.725"> Glory—beyond all glory ever seen, </l>
            <l n="3.726"> Confusion infinite of heaven and earth, </l>
            <l n="3.727"> Dazzling the soul. Meanwhile, prophetic harps </l>
            <l n="3.728"> In every grove were ringing, 'War shall cease; </l>
            <l n="3.729"> 'Did ye not hear that conquest is abjured? </l>
            <l n="3.730"> 'Bring garlands, bring forth choicest flowers, to deck </l>
            <l n="3.731"> 'The tree of Liberty.'—My heart rebounded; </l>
            <l n="3.732"> My melancholy voice the chorus joined; </l>
            <l n="3.733"> —'Be joyful all ye nations; in all lands, </l>
            <l n="3.734"> 'Ye that are capable of joy be glad! </l>
            <l n="3.735"> 'Henceforth, whate'er is wanting to yourselves </l>
            <l n="3.736"> 'In others ye shall promptly find;—and all, </l>
            <l n="3.737"> 'Enriched by mutual and reflected wealth, </l>
            <l n="3.738"> 'Shall with one heart honour their common kind.' </l>
            <l n="3.739">   Thus was I reconverted to the world; </l>
            <l n="3.740"> Society became my glittering bride, </l>
            <l n="3.741"> And airy hopes my children.—From the depths </l>
            <l n="3.742"> Of natural passion, seemingly escaped, </l>
            <l n="3.743"> My soul diffused herself in wide embrace </l>
            <l n="3.744"> Of institutions, and the forms of things; </l>
            <l n="3.745"> As they exist, in mutable array, </l>
            <l n="3.746"> Upon life's surface. What, though in my veins </l>
            <l n="3.747"> There flowed no Gallic blood, nor had I breathed </l>
            <l n="3.748"> The air of France, not less than Gallic zeal </l>
            <l n="3.749"> Kindled and burnt among the sapless twigs </l>
            <l n="3.750"> Of my exhausted heart. If busy men </l>
            <l n="3.751"> In sober conclave met, to weave a web </l>
            <l n="3.752"> Of amity, whose living threads should stretch </l>
            <l n="3.753"> Beyond the seas, and to the farthest pole, </l>
            <l n="3.754"> There did I sit, assisting. If, with noise </l>
            <l n="3.755"> And acclamation, crowds in open air </l>
            <l n="3.756"> Expressed the tumult of their minds, my voice </l>
            <l n="3.757"> There mingled, heard or not. The powers of song </l>
            <l n="3.758"> I left not uninvoked; and, in still groves, </l>
            <l n="3.759"> Where mild enthusiasts tuned a pensive lay </l>
            <l n="3.760"> Of thanks and expectation, in accord </l>
            <l n="3.761"> With their belief, I sang Saturnian rule </l>
            <l n="3.762"> Returned,—a progeny of golden years </l>
            <l n="3.763"> Permitted to descend, and bless mankind. </l>
            <l n="3.764"> —With promises the Hebrew Scriptures teem: </l>
            <l n="3.765"> I felt their invitation; and resumed </l>
            <l n="3.766"> A long-suspended office in the House </l>
            <l n="3.767"> Of public worship, where, the glowing phrase </l>
            <l n="3.768"> Of ancient inspiration serving me, </l>
            <l n="3.769"> I promised also,—with undaunted trust </l>
            <l n="3.770"> Foretold, and added prayer to prophecy; </l>
            <l n="3.771"> The admiration winning of the crowd; </l>
            <l n="3.772"> The help desiring of the pure devout. </l>
            <l n="3.773">   Scorn and contempt forbid me to proceed! </l>
            <l n="3.774"> But History, time's slavish scribe, will tell </l>
            <l n="3.775"> How rapidly the zealots of the cause </l>
            <l n="3.776"> Disbanded—or in hostile ranks appeared; </l>
            <l n="3.777"> Some, tired of honest service; these, outdone, </l>
            <l n="3.778"> Disgusted therefore, or appalled, by aims </l>
            <l n="3.779"> Of fiercer zealots—so confusion reigned, </l>
            <l n="3.780"> And the more faithful were compelled to exclaim, </l>
            <l n="3.781"> As Brutus did to Virtue, 'Liberty, </l>
            <l n="3.782"> 'I worshipped thee, and find thee but a Shade!' </l>
            <l n="3.783">   Such recantation had for me no charm, </l>
            <l n="3.784"> Nor would I bend to it; who should have grieved </l>
            <l n="3.785"> At aught, however fair, that bore the mien </l>
            <l n="3.786"> Of a conclusion, or catastrophe. </l>
            <l n="3.787"> Why then conceal, that, when the simply good </l>
            <l n="3.788"> In timid selfishness withdrew, I sought </l>
            <l n="3.789"> Other support, not scrupulous whence it came; </l>
            <l n="3.790"> And, by what compromise it stood, not nice? </l>
            <l n="3.791"> Enough if notions seemed to be high-pitched, </l>
            <l n="3.792"> And qualities determined.—Among men </l>
            <l n="3.793"> So charactered did I maintain a strife </l>
            <l n="3.794"> Hopeless, and still more hopeless every hour; </l>
            <l n="3.795"> But, in the process, I began to feel </l>
            <l n="3.796"> That, if the emancipation of the world </l>
            <l n="3.797"> Were missed, I should at least secure my own, </l>
            <l n="3.798"> And be in part compensated. For rights, </l>
            <l n="3.799"> Widely—inveterately usurped upon, </l>
            <l n="3.800"> I spake with vehemence; and promptly seized </l>
            <l n="3.801"> All that Abstraction furnished for my needs </l>
            <l n="3.802"> Or purposes, nor scrupled to proclaim, </l>
            <l n="3.803"> And propagate, by liberty of life, </l>
            <l n="3.804"> Those new persuasions. Not that I rejoiced, </l>
            <l n="3.805"> Or even found pleasure, in such vagrant course, </l>
            <l n="3.806"> For its own sake; but farthest from the walk </l>
            <l n="3.807"> Which I had trod in happiness and peace, </l>
            <l n="3.808"> Was most inviting to a troubled mind; </l>
            <l n="3.809"> That, in a struggling and distempered world, </l>
            <l n="3.810"> Saw a seductive image of herself. </l>
            <l n="3.811"> Yet, mark the contradictions of which Man </l>
            <l n="3.812"> Is still the sport! Here Nature was my guide, </l>
            <l n="3.813"> The Nature of the dissolute; but thee, </l>
            <l n="3.814"> O fostering Nature! I rejected—smiled </l>
            <l n="3.815"> At others' tears in pity; and in scorn </l>
            <l n="3.816"> At those, which thy soft influence sometimes drew </l>
            <l n="3.817"> From my unguarded heart.—The tranquil shores </l>
            <l n="3.818"> Of Britain circumscribed me; else, perhaps </l>
            <l n="3.819"> I might have been entangled among deeds, </l>
            <l n="3.820"> Which, now, as infamous, I should abhor— </l>
            <l n="3.821"> Despise, as senseless: for my spirit relished </l>
            <l n="3.822"> Strangely the exasperation of that Land, </l>
            <l n="3.823"> Which turned an angry beak against the down </l>
            <l n="3.824"> Of her own breast; confounded into hope </l>
            <l n="3.825"> Of disencumbering thus her fretful wings. </l>
            <l n="3.826">   But all was quieted by iron bonds </l>
            <l n="3.827"> Of military sway. The shifting aims, </l>
            <l n="3.828"> The moral interests, the creative might, </l>
            <l n="3.829"> The varied functions and high attributes </l>
            <l n="3.830"> Of civil action, yielded to a power </l>
            <l n="3.831"> Formal, and odious, and contemptible. </l>
            <l n="3.832"> —In Britain, ruled a panic dread of change; </l>
            <l n="3.833"> The weak were praised, rewarded, and advanced; </l>
            <l n="3.834"> And, from the impulse of a just disdain, </l>
            <l n="3.835"> Once more did I retire into myself. </l>
            <l n="3.836"> There feeling no contentment, I resolved </l>
            <l n="3.837"> To fly, for safeguard, to some foreign shore, </l>
            <l n="3.838"> Remote from Europe; from her blasted hopes; </l>
            <l n="3.839"> Her fields of carnage, and polluted air. </l>
            <l n="3.840">   Fresh blew the wind, when o'er the Atlantic Main </l>
            <l n="3.841"> The ship went gliding with her thoughtless crew; </l>
            <l n="3.842"> And who among them but an Exile, freed </l>
            <l n="3.843"> From discontent, indifferent, pleased to sit </l>
            <l n="3.844"> Among the busily-employed, not more </l>
            <l n="3.845"> With obligation charged, with service taxed, </l>
            <l n="3.846"> Than the loose pendant—to the idle wind </l>
            <l n="3.847"> Upon the tall mast streaming. But, ye Powers </l>
            <l n="3.848"> Of soul and sense mysteriously allied, </l>
            <l n="3.849"> Oh, never let the Wretched, if a choice </l>
            <l n="3.850"> Be left him, trust the freight of his distress </l>
            <l n="3.851"> To a long voyage on the silent deep! </l>
            <l n="3.852"> For, like a plague, will memory break out; </l>
            <l n="3.853"> And, in the blank and solitude of things, </l>
            <l n="3.854"> Upon his spirit, with a fever's strength, </l>
            <l n="3.855"> Will conscience prey.—Feebly must they have felt </l>
            <l n="3.856"> Who, in old time, attired with snakes and whips </l>
            <l n="3.857"> The vengeful Furies. 'Beautiful' regards </l>
            <l n="3.858"> Were turned on me—the face of her I loved; </l>
            <l n="3.859"> The Wife and Mother pitifully fixing </l>
            <l n="3.860"> Tender reproaches, insupportable! </l>
            <l n="3.861"> Where now that boasted liberty? No welcome </l>
            <l n="3.862"> From unknown objects I received; and those, </l>
            <l n="3.863"> Known and familiar, which the vaulted sky </l>
            <l n="3.864"> Did, in the placid clearness of the night, </l>
            <l n="3.865"> Disclose, had accusations to prefer </l>
            <l n="3.866"> Against my peace. Within the cabin stood </l>
            <l n="3.867"> That volume—as a compass for the soul— </l>
            <l n="3.868"> Revered among the nations. I implored </l>
            <l n="3.869"> Its guidance; but the infallible support </l>
            <l n="3.870"> Of faith was wanting. Tell me, why refused </l>
            <l n="3.871"> To One by storms annoyed and adverse winds; </l>
            <l n="3.872"> Perplexed with currents; of his weakness sick; </l>
            <l n="3.873"> Of vain endeavours tired; and by his own, </l>
            <l n="3.874"> And by his nature's, ignorance, dismayed! </l>
            <l n="3.875">   Long-wished-for sight, the Western World appeared; </l>
            <l n="3.876"> And, when the ship was moored, I leaped ashore </l>
            <l n="3.877"> Indignantly—resolved to be a man, </l>
            <l n="3.878"> Who, having o'er the past no power, would live </l>
            <l n="3.879"> No longer in subjection to the past, </l>
            <l n="3.880"> With abject mind—from a tyrannic lord </l>
            <l n="3.881"> Inviting penance, fruitlessly endured: </l>
            <l n="3.882"> So, like a fugitive, whose feet have cleared </l>
            <l n="3.883"> Some boundary, which his followers may not cross </l>
            <l n="3.884"> In prosecution of their deadly chase, </l>
            <l n="3.885"> Respiring I looked round.—How bright the sun, </l>
            <l n="3.886"> The breeze how soft! Can anything produced </l>
            <l n="3.887"> In the old World compare, thought I, for power </l>
            <l n="3.888"> And majesty with this gigantic stream, </l>
            <l n="3.889"> Sprung from the desert? And behold a city </l>
            <l n="3.890"> Fresh, youthful, and aspiring! What are these </l>
            <l n="3.891"> To me, or I to them? As much at least </l>
            <l n="3.892"> As he desires that they should be, whom winds </l>
            <l n="3.893"> And waves have wafted to this distant shore, </l>
            <l n="3.894"> In the condition of a damaged seed, </l>
            <l n="3.895"> Whose fibres cannot, if they would, take root. </l>
            <l n="3.896"> Here may I roam at large;—my business is, </l>
            <l n="3.897"> Roaming at large, to observe, and not to feel, </l>
            <l n="3.898"> And, therefore, not to act—convinced that all </l>
            <l n="3.899"> Which bears the name of action, howsoe'er </l>
            <l n="3.900"> Beginning, ends in servitude—still painful, </l>
            <l n="3.901"> And mostly profitless. And, sooth to say, </l>
            <l n="3.902"> On nearer view, a motley spectacle </l>
            <l n="3.903"> Appeared, of high pretensions,—unreproved </l>
            <l n="3.904"> But by the obstreperous voice of higher still; </l>
            <l n="3.905"> Big passions strutting on a petty stage; </l>
            <l n="3.906"> Which a detached spectator may regard </l>
            <l n="3.907"> Not unamused.—But ridicule demands </l>
            <l n="3.908"> Quick change of objects; and, to laugh alone, </l>
            <l n="3.909"> At a composing distance from the haunts </l>
            <l n="3.910"> Of strife and folly, though it be a treat </l>
            <l n="3.911"> As choice as musing Leisure can bestow; </l>
            <l n="3.912"> Yet, in the very centre of the crowd, </l>
            <l n="3.913"> To keep the secret of a poignant scorn, </l>
            <l n="3.914"> Howe'er to airy Demons suitable, </l>
            <l n="3.915"> Of all unsocial courses, is least fit </l>
            <l n="3.916"> For the gross spirit of mankind,—the one </l>
            <l n="3.917"> That soonest fails to please, and quickliest turns </l>
            <l n="3.918"> Into vexation. </l>
            <l n="3.919">                 Let us, then, I said, </l>
            <l n="3.920"> Leave this unknit Republic to the scourge </l>
            <l n="3.921"> Of her own passions; and to regions haste, </l>
            <l n="3.922"> Whose shades have never felt the encroaching axe, </l>
            <l n="3.923"> Or soil endured a transfer in the mart </l>
            <l n="3.924"> Of dire rapacity. There, Man abides, </l>
            <l n="3.925"> Primeval Nature's child. A creature weak </l>
            <l n="3.926"> In combination, (wherefore else driven back </l>
            <l n="3.927"> So far, and of his old inheritance </l>
            <l n="3.928"> So easily deprived?) but, for that cause, </l>
            <l n="3.929"> More dignified, and stronger in himself; </l>
            <l n="3.930"> Whether to act, judge, suffer, or enjoy. </l>
            <l n="3.931"> True, the intelligence of social art </l>
            <l n="3.932"> Hath overpowered his forefathers, and soon </l>
            <l n="3.933"> Will sweep the remnant of his line away; </l>
            <l n="3.934"> But contemplations, worthier, nobler far </l>
            <l n="3.935"> Than her destructive energies, attend </l>
            <l n="3.936"> His independence, when along the side </l>
            <l n="3.937"> Of Mississippi, or that northern stream </l>
            <l n="3.938"> That spreads into successive seas, he walks; </l>
            <l n="3.939"> Pleased to perceive his own unshackled life, </l>
            <l n="3.940"> And his innate capacities of soul, </l>
            <l n="3.941"> There imaged: or when, having gained the top </l>
            <l n="3.942"> Of some commanding eminence, which yet </l>
            <l n="3.943"> Intruder ne'er beheld, he thence surveys </l>
            <l n="3.944"> Regions of wood and wide savannah, vast </l>
            <l n="3.945"> Expanse of unappropriated earth, </l>
            <l n="3.946"> With mind that sheds a light on what he sees; </l>
            <l n="3.947"> Free as the sun, and lonely as the sun, </l>
            <l n="3.948"> Pouring above his head its radiance down </l>
            <l n="3.949"> Upon a living and rejoicing world! </l>
            <l n="3.950">   So, westward, tow'rd the unviolated woods </l>
            <l n="3.951"> I bent my way; and, roaming far and wide, </l>
            <l n="3.952"> Failed not to greet the merry Mocking-bird; </l>
            <l n="3.953"> And, while the melancholy Muccawiss </l>
            <l n="3.954"> (The sportive bird's companion in the grove) </l>
            <l n="3.955"> Repeated, o'er and o'er, his plaintive cry, </l>
            <l n="3.956"> I sympathised at leisure with the sound; </l>
            <l n="3.957"> But that pure archetype of human greatness, </l>
            <l n="3.958"> I found him not. There, in his stead, appeared </l>
            <l n="3.959"> A creature, squalid, vengeful, and impure; </l>
            <l n="3.960"> Remorseless, and submissive to no law </l>
            <l n="3.961"> But superstitious fear, and abject sloth. </l>
            <l n="3.962">   Enough is told! Here am I—ye have heard </l>
            <l n="3.963"> What evidence I seek, and vainly seek; </l>
            <l n="3.964"> What from my fellow-beings I require, </l>
            <l n="3.965"> And either they have not to give, or I </l>
            <l n="3.966"> Lack virtue to receive; what I myself, </l>
            <l n="3.967"> Too oft by wilful forfeiture, have lost </l>
            <l n="3.968"> Nor can regain. How languidly I look </l>
            <l n="3.969"> Upon this visible fabric of the world, </l>
            <l n="3.970"> May be divined—perhaps it hath been said:— </l>
            <l n="3.971"> But spare your pity, if there be in me </l>
            <l n="3.972"> Aught that deserves respect: for I exist, </l>
            <l n="3.973"> Within myself, not comfortless.—The tenor </l>
            <l n="3.974"> Which my life holds, he readily may conceive </l>
            <l n="3.975"> Whoe'er hath stood to watch a mountain brook </l>
            <l n="3.976"> In some still passage of its course, and seen, </l>
            <l n="3.977"> Within the depths of its capacious breast, </l>
            <l n="3.978"> Inverted trees, rocks, clouds, and azure sky; </l>
            <l n="3.979"> And, on its glassy surface, specks of foam, </l>
            <l n="3.980"> And conglobated bubbles undissolved, </l>
            <l n="3.981"> Numerous as stars; that, by their onward lapse, </l>
            <l n="3.982"> Betray to sight the motion of the stream, </l>
            <l n="3.983"> Else imperceptible. Meanwhile, is heard </l>
            <l n="3.984"> A softened roar, or murmur; and the sound </l>
            <l n="3.985"> Though soothing, and the little floating isles </l>
            <l n="3.986"> Though beautiful, are both by Nature charged </l>
            <l n="3.987"> With the same pensive office; and make known </l>
            <l n="3.988"> Through what perplexing labyrinths, abrupt </l>
            <l n="3.989"> Precipitations, and untoward straits, </l>
            <l n="3.990"> The earth-born wanderer hath passed; and quickly, </l>
            <l n="3.991"> That respite o'er, like traverses and toils </l>
            <l n="3.992"> Must he again encounter.—Such a stream </l>
            <l n="3.993"> Is human Life; and so the Spirit fares </l>
            <l n="3.994"> In the best quiet to her course allowed; </l>
            <l n="3.995"> And such is mine,—save only for a hope </l>
            <l n="3.996"> That my particular current soon will reach </l>

            <head>DESPONDENCY CORRECTED</head>
            <head>ARGUMENT</head>
            <p>State of feeling produced by the foregoing Narrative—A belief 
in a superintending Providence the only adequate support under 
affliction—Wanderer's ejaculation—Acknowledges the difficulty of 
a lively faith—Hence immoderate sorrow—Exhortations—How 
received—Wanderer applies his discourse to that other cause of 
dejection in the Solitary's mind—Disappointment from the French 
Revolution—States grounds of hope, and insists on the necessity 
of patience and fortitude with respect to the course of great 
revolutions—Knowledge the source of tranquillity—Rural Solitude 
favourable to knowledge of the inferior Creatures; Study of their 
habits and ways recommended; exhortation to bodily exertion and 
communion with Nature—Morbid Solitude pitiable—Superstition 
better than apathy—Apathy and destitution unknown in the infancy 
of society—The various modes of Religion prevented it— 
Illustrated in the Jewish, Persian, Babylonian, Chaldean, and 
Grecian modes of belief—Solitary interposes—Wanderer points out 
the influence of religious and imaginative feeling in the humble 
ranks of society, illustrated from present and past times—These 
principles tend to recall exploded superstitions and popery— 
Wanderer rebuts this charge, and contrasts the dignities of the 
Imagination with the presumptuous littleness of certain modern 
Philosophers—Recommends other lights and guides—Asserts the 
power of the soul to regenerate herself; Solitary asks how— 
Reply—Personal appeal—Exhortation to activity of body renewed— 
How to commune with Nature—Wanderer concludes with a legitimate 
union of the imagination, affections, understanding, and reason— 
Effect of his discourse—Evening; Return to the Cottage.

            <l n="4.1"> HERE closed the Tenant of that lonely vale </l>
            <l n="4.2"> His mournful narrative—commenced in pain, </l>
            <l n="4.3"> In pain commenced, and ended without peace: </l>
            <l n="4.4"> Yet tempered, not unfrequently, with strains </l>
            <l n="4.5"> Of native feeling, grateful to our minds; </l>
            <l n="4.6"> And yielding surely some relief to his, </l>
            <l n="4.7"> While we sate listening with compassion due. </l>
            <l n="4.8"> A pause of silence followed; then, with voice </l>
            <l n="4.9"> That did not falter though the heart was moved, </l>
            <l n="4.10"> The Wanderer said:— </l>
            <l n="4.11">                       “One adequate support </l>
            <l n="4.12"> For the calamities of mortal life </l>
            <l n="4.13"> Exists—one only; an assured belief </l>
            <l n="4.14"> That the procession of our fate, howe'er </l>
            <l n="4.15"> Sad or disturbed, is ordered by a Being </l>
            <l n="4.16"> Of infinite benevolence and power; </l>
            <l n="4.17"> Whose everlasting purposes embrace </l>
            <l n="4.18"> All accidents, converting them to good. </l>
            <l n="4.19"> —The darts of anguish 'fix' not where the seat </l>
            <l n="4.20"> Of suffering hath been thoroughly fortified </l>
            <l n="4.21"> By acquiescence in the Will supreme </l>
            <l n="4.22"> For time and for eternity; by faith, </l>
            <l n="4.23"> Faith absolute in God, including hope, </l>
            <l n="4.24"> And the defence that lies in boundless love </l>
            <l n="4.25"> Of his perfections; with habitual dread </l>
            <l n="4.26"> Of aught unworthily conceived, endured </l>
            <l n="4.27"> Impatiently, ill-done, or left undone, </l>
            <l n="4.28"> To the dishonour of his holy name. </l>
            <l n="4.29"> Soul of our Souls, and safeguard of the world! </l>
            <l n="4.30"> Sustain, thou only canst, the sick of heart; </l>
            <l n="4.31"> Restore their languid spirits, and recall </l>
            <l n="4.32"> Their lost affections unto thee and thine!” </l>
            <l n="4.33">   Then, as we issued from that covert nook, </l>
            <l n="4.34"> He thus continued, lifting up his eyes </l>
            <l n="4.35"> To heaven:—“How beautiful this dome of sky; </l>
            <l n="4.36"> And the vast hills, in fluctuation fixed </l>
            <l n="4.37"> At thy command, how awful! Shall the Soul, </l>
            <l n="4.38"> Human and rational, report of thee </l>
            <l n="4.39"> Even less than these?—Be mute who will, who can, </l>
            <l n="4.40"> Yet I will praise thee with impassioned voice: </l>
            <l n="4.41"> My lips, that may forget thee in the crowd, </l>
            <l n="4.42"> Cannot forget thee here; where thou hast built, </l>
            <l n="4.43"> For thy own glory, in the wilderness! </l>
            <l n="4.44"> Me didst thou constitute a priest of thine, </l>
            <l n="4.45"> In such a temple as we now behold </l>
            <l n="4.46"> Reared for thy presence: therefore, am I bound </l>
            <l n="4.47"> To worship, here, and everywhere—as one </l>
            <l n="4.48"> Not doomed to ignorance, though forced to tread, </l>
            <l n="4.49"> From childhood up, the ways of poverty; </l>
            <l n="4.50"> From unreflecting ignorance preserved, </l>
            <l n="4.51"> And from debasement rescued.—By thy grace </l>
            <l n="4.52"> The particle divine remained unquenched; </l>
            <l n="4.53"> And, 'mid the wild weeds of a rugged soil, </l>
            <l n="4.54"> Thy bounty caused to flourish deathless flowers, </l>
            <l n="4.55"> From paradise transplanted: wintry age </l>
            <l n="4.56"> Impends; the frost will gather round my heart; </l>
            <l n="4.57"> If the flowers wither, I am worse than dead! </l>
            <l n="4.58"> —Come, labour, when the worn-out frame requires </l>
            <l n="4.59"> Perpetual sabbath; come, disease and want; </l>
            <l n="4.60"> And sad exclusion through decay of sense; </l>
            <l n="4.61"> But leave me unabated trust in thee— </l>
            <l n="4.62"> And let thy favour, to the end of life, </l>
            <l n="4.63"> Inspire me with ability to seek </l>
            <l n="4.64"> Repose and hope among eternal things— </l>
            <l n="4.65"> Father of heaven and earth! and I am rich, </l>
            <l n="4.66"> And will possess my portion in content! </l>
            <l n="4.67">   And what are things eternal?—powers depart,” </l>
            <l n="4.68"> The grey-haired Wanderer stedfastly replied, </l>
            <l n="4.69"> Answering the question which himself had asked, </l>
            <l n="4.70"> “Possessions vanish, and opinions change, </l>
            <l n="4.71"> And passions hold a fluctuating seat: </l>
            <l n="4.72"> But, by the storms of circumstance unshaken, </l>
            <l n="4.73"> And subject neither to eclipse nor wane, </l>
            <l n="4.74"> Duty exists;—immutably survive, </l>
            <l n="4.75"> For our support, the measures and the forms, </l>
            <l n="4.76"> Which an abstract intelligence supplies; </l>
            <l n="4.77"> Whose kingdom is, where time and space are not. </l>
            <l n="4.78"> Of other converse which mind, soul, and heart, </l>
            <l n="4.79"> Do, with united urgency, require, </l>
            <l n="4.80"> What more that may not perish?—Thou, dread source, </l>
            <l n="4.81"> Prime, self-existing cause and end of all </l>
            <l n="4.82"> That in the scale of being fill their place; </l>
            <l n="4.83"> Above our human region, or below, </l>
            <l n="4.84"> Set and sustained;—thou, who didst wrap the cloud </l>
            <l n="4.85"> Of infancy around us, that thyself, </l>
            <l n="4.86"> Therein, with our simplicity awhile </l>
            <l n="4.87"> Might'st hold, on earth, communion undisturbed; </l>
            <l n="4.88"> Who from the anarchy of dreaming sleep, </l>

            <l n="4.114"> Of some huge hill—expectant, I beheld </l>

            <l n="4.117"> His bounteous gift! or saw him toward the deep </l>
            <l n="4.118"> Sink, with a retinue of flaming clouds </l>
            <l n="4.119"> Attended; then, my spirit was entranced </l>
            <l n="4.120"> With joy exalted to beatitude; </l>
            <l n="4.121"> The measure of my soul was filled with bliss, </l>
            <l n="4.122"> And holiest love; as earth, sea, air, with light, </l>
            <l n="4.123"> With pomp, with glory, with magnificence! </l>
            <l n="4.124">   Those fervent raptures are for ever flown; </l>

            <l n="4.153"> In that excess which conscience disapproves. </l>
            <l n="4.154"> For who could sink and settle to that point </l>
            <l n="4.155"> Of selfishness; so senseless who could be </l>

            <l n="4.163"> Is of such incapacity, methinks, </l>
            <l n="4.164"> No natural branch; despondency far less; </l>
            <l n="4.165"> And, least of all, is absolute despair. </l>

            <l n="4.240">   While, in this strain, the venerable Sage </l>
            <l n="4.241"> Poured forth his aspirations, and announced </l>

            <l n="4.321"> Then shall 'four' triumph be complete as theirs. </l>
            <l n="4.322"> Yet, should this confidence prove vain, the wise </l>
            <l n="4.323"> Have still the keeping of their proper peace; </l>
            <l n="4.324"> Are guardians of their own tranquillity. </l>
            <l n="4.325"> They act, or they recede, observe, and feel; </l>
            <l n="4.326"> 'Knowing the heart of man is set to be </l>
            <l n="4.327"> The centre of this world, about the which </l>
            <l n="4.328"> Those revolutions of disturbances </l>
            <l n="4.329"> Still roll; where all the aspects of misery </l>
            <l n="4.330"> Predominate; whose strong effects are such </l>
            <l n="4.331"> As he must bear, being powerless to redress; </l>
            <l n="4.332"> “And that unless above himself he can </l>
            <l n="4.333"> Erect himself, how poor a thing is Man!”' </l>
            <l n="4.334">   Happy is he who lives to understand, </l>
            <l n="4.335"> Not human nature only, but explores </l>
            <l n="4.336"> All natures,—to the end that he may find </l>
            <l n="4.337"> The law that governs each; and where begins </l>
            <l n="4.338"> The union, the partition where, that makes </l>
            <l n="4.339"> Kind and degree, among all visible Beings; </l>
            <l n="4.340"> The constitutions, powers, and faculties, </l>
            <l n="4.341"> Which they inherit,—cannot step beyond,— </l>
            <l n="4.342"> And cannot fall beneath; that do assign </l>
            <l n="4.343"> To every class its station and its office, </l>
            <l n="4.344"> Through all the mighty commonwealth of things </l>
            <l n="4.345"> Up from the creeping plant to sovereign Man. </l>
            <l n="4.346"> Such converse, if directed by a meek, </l>
            <l n="4.347"> Sincere, and humble spirit, teaches love: </l>
            <l n="4.348"> For knowledge is delight; and such delight </l>
            <l n="4.349"> Breeds love: yet, suited as it rather is </l>
            <l n="4.350"> To thought and to the climbing intellect, </l>
            <l n="4.351"> It teaches less to love, than to adore; </l>
            <l n="4.352"> If that be not indeed the highest love!” </l>
            <l n="4.353">   “Yet,” said I, tempted here to interpose, </l>
            <l n="4.354"> “The dignity of life is not impaired </l>
            <l n="4.355"> By aught that innocently satisfies </l>
            <l n="4.356"> The humbler cravings of the heart; and he </l>
            <l n="4.357"> Is a still happier man, who, for those heights </l>
            <l n="4.358"> Of speculation not unfit, descends; </l>
            <l n="4.359"> And such benign affections cultivates </l>
            <l n="4.360"> Among the inferior kinds; not merely those </l>
            <l n="4.361"> That he may call his own, and which depend, </l>
            <l n="4.362"> As individual objects of regard, </l>
            <l n="4.363"> Upon his care, from whom he also looks </l>
            <l n="4.364"> For signs and tokens of a mutual bond; </l>
            <l n="4.365"> But others, far beyond this narrow sphere, </l>
            <l n="4.366"> Whom, for the very sake of love, he loves. </l>
            <l n="4.367"> Nor is it a mean praise of rural life </l>
            <l n="4.368"> And solitude, that they do favour most, </l>
            <l n="4.369"> Most frequently call forth, and best sustain, </l>
            <l n="4.370"> These pure sensations; that can penetrate </l>
            <l n="4.371"> The obstreperous city; on the barren seas </l>
            <l n="4.372"> Are not unfelt; and much might recommend, </l>
            <l n="4.373"> How much they might inspirit and endear, </l>
            <l n="4.374"> The loneliness of this sublime retreat!” </l>
            <l n="4.375">   “Yes,” said the Sage, resuming the discourse </l>
            <l n="4.376"> Again directed to his downcast Friend, </l>
            <l n="4.377"> “If, with the froward will and grovelling soul </l>
            <l n="4.378"> Of man, offended, liberty is here, </l>
            <l n="4.379"> And invitation every hour renewed, </l>
            <l n="4.380"> To mark 'their' placid state, who never heard </l>
            <l n="4.381"> Of a command which they have power to break, </l>
            <l n="4.382"> Or rule which they are tempted to transgress: </l>
            <l n="4.383"> These, with a soothed or elevated heart, </l>
            <l n="4.384"> May we behold; their knowledge register; </l>
            <l n="4.385"> Observe their ways; and, free from envy, find </l>
            <l n="4.386"> Complacence there:—but wherefore this to you? </l>
            <l n="4.387"> I guess that, welcome to your lonely hearth, </l>
            <l n="4.388"> The redbreast, ruffled up by winter's cold </l>
            <l n="4.389"> Into a 'feathery bunch,' feeds at your hand: </l>
            <l n="4.390"> A box, perchance, is from your casement hung </l>
            <l n="4.391"> For the small wren to build in;—not in vain, </l>
            <l n="4.392"> The barriers disregarding that surround </l>
            <l n="4.393"> This deep abiding place, before your sight </l>
            <l n="4.394"> Mounts on the breeze the butterfly; and soars, </l>
            <l n="4.395"> Small creature as she is, from earth's bright flowers, </l>
            <l n="4.396"> Into the dewy clouds. Ambition reigns </l>
            <l n="4.397"> In the waste wilderness: the Soul ascends </l>
            <l n="4.398"> Drawn towards her native firmament of heaven, </l>
            <l n="4.399"> When the fresh eagle, in the month of May, </l>
            <l n="4.400"> Upborne, at evening, on replenished wing, </l>
            <l n="4.401"> This shaded valley leaves; and leaves the dark </l>
            <l n="4.402"> Empurpled hills, conspicuously renewing </l>
            <l n="4.403"> A proud communication with the sun </l>
            <l n="4.404"> Low sunk beneath the horizon!—List!—I heard, </l>
            <l n="4.405"> From yon huge breast of rock, a voice sent forth </l>
            <l n="4.406"> As if the visible mountain made the cry. </l>
            <l n="4.407"> Again!”—The effect upon the soul was such </l>
            <l n="4.408"> As he expressed: from out the mountain's heart </l>
            <l n="4.409"> The solemn voice appeared to issue, startling </l>
            <l n="4.410"> The blank air—for the region all around </l>
            <l n="4.411"> Stood empty of all shape of life, and silent </l>
            <l n="4.412"> Save for that single cry, the unanswered bleat </l>
            <l n="4.413"> Of a poor lamb—left somewhere to itself, </l>
            <l n="4.414"> The plaintive spirit of the solitude! </l>
            <l n="4.415"> He paused, as if unwilling to proceed, </l>
            <l n="4.416"> Through consciousness that silence in such place </l>
            <l n="4.417"> Was best, the most affecting eloquence. </l>
            <l n="4.418"> But soon his thoughts returned upon themselves, </l>
            <l n="4.419"> And, in soft tone of speech, thus he resumed. </l>
            <l n="4.420">   “Ah! if the heart, too confidently raised, </l>
            <l n="4.421"> Perchance too lightly occupied, or lulled </l>
            <l n="4.422"> Too easily, despise or overlook </l>
            <l n="4.423"> The vassalage that binds her to the earth, </l>
            <l n="4.424"> Her sad dependence upon time, and all </l>
            <l n="4.425"> The trepidations of mortality, </l>
            <l n="4.426"> What place so destitute and void—but there </l>
            <l n="4.427"> The little flower her vanity shall check; </l>
            <l n="4.428"> The trailing worm reprove her thoughtless pride? </l>
            <l n="4.429">   These craggy regions, these chaotic wilds, </l>
            <l n="4.430"> Does that benignity pervade, that warms </l>
            <l n="4.431"> The mole contented with her darksome walk </l>
            <l n="4.432"> In the cold ground; and to the emmet gives </l>
            <l n="4.433"> Her foresight, and intelligence that makes </l>
            <l n="4.434"> The tiny creatures strong by social league; </l>
            <l n="4.435"> Supports the generations, multiplies </l>
            <l n="4.436"> Their tribes, till we behold a spacious plain </l>
            <l n="4.437"> Or grassy bottom, all, with little hills— </l>
            <l n="4.438"> Their labour, covered, as a lake with waves; </l>
            <l n="4.439"> Thousands of cities, in the desert place </l>
            <l n="4.440"> Built up of life, and food, and means of life! </l>
            <l n="4.441"> Nor wanting here, to entertain the thought, </l>
            <l n="4.442"> Creatures that in communities exist, </l>
            <l n="4.443"> Less, as might seem, for general guardianship </l>
            <l n="4.444"> Or through dependence upon mutual aid, </l>
            <l n="4.445"> Than by participation of delight </l>
            <l n="4.446"> And a strict love of fellowship, combined. </l>
            <l n="4.447"> What other spirit can it be that prompts </l>
            <l n="4.448"> The gilded summer flies to mix and weave </l>
            <l n="4.449"> Their sports together in the solar beam, </l>
            <l n="4.450"> Or in the gloom of twilight hum their joy? </l>
            <l n="4.451"> More obviously the self-same influence rules </l>
            <l n="4.452"> The feathered kinds; the fieldfare's pensive flock, </l>
            <l n="4.453"> The cawing rooks, and sea-mews from afar, </l>
            <l n="4.454"> Hovering above these inland solitudes, </l>
            <l n="4.455"> By the rough wind unscattered, at whose call </l>
            <l n="4.456"> Up through the trenches of the long-drawn vales </l>
            <l n="4.457"> Their voyage was begun: nor is its power </l>
            <l n="4.458"> Unfelt among the sedentary fowl </l>
            <l n="4.459"> That seek yon pool, and there prolong their stay </l>
            <l n="4.460"> In silent congress; or together roused </l>
            <l n="4.461"> Take flight; while with their clang the air resounds: </l>
            <l n="4.462"> And, over all, in that ethereal vault, </l>
            <l n="4.463"> Is the mute company of changeful clouds; </l>
            <l n="4.464"> Bright apparition, suddenly put forth, </l>
            <l n="4.465"> The rainbow smiling on the faded storm; </l>
            <l n="4.466"> The mild assemblage of the starry heavens; </l>
            <l n="4.467"> And the great sun, earth's universal lord! </l>
            <l n="4.468">   How bountiful is Nature! he shall find </l>
            <l n="4.469"> Who seeks not; and to him, who hath not asked, </l>
            <l n="4.470"> Large measure shall be dealt. Three sabbath-days </l>
            <l n="4.471"> Are scarcely told, since, on a service bent </l>
            <l n="4.472"> Of mere humanity, you clomb those heights; </l>
            <l n="4.473"> And what a marvellous and heavenly show </l>
            <l n="4.474"> Was suddenly revealed!—the swains moved on, </l>
            <l n="4.475"> And heeded not: you lingered, you perceived </l>
            <l n="4.476"> And felt, deeply as living man could feel. </l>
            <l n="4.477"> There is a luxury in self-dispraise; </l>
            <l n="4.478"> And inward self-disparagement affords </l>
            <l n="4.479"> To meditative spleen a grateful feast. </l>
            <l n="4.480"> Trust me, pronouncing on your own desert, </l>
            <l n="4.481"> You judge unthankfully: distempered nerves </l>
            <l n="4.482"> Infect the thoughts: the languor of the frame </l>
            <l n="4.483"> Depresses the soul's vigour. Quit your couch— </l>
            <l n="4.484"> Cleave not so fondly to your moody cell; </l>
            <l n="4.485"> Nor let the hallowed powers, that shed from heaven </l>
            <l n="4.486"> Stillness and rest, with disapproving eye </l>
            <l n="4.487"> Look down upon your taper, through a watch </l>
            <l n="4.488"> Of midnight hours, unseasonably twinkling </l>
            <l n="4.489"> In this deep Hollow, like a sullen star </l>
            <l n="4.490"> Dimly reflected in a lonely pool. </l>
            <l n="4.491"> Take courage, and withdraw yourself from ways </l>
            <l n="4.492"> That run not parallel to nature's course. </l>
            <l n="4.493"> Rise with the lark! your matins shall obtain </l>
            <l n="4.494"> Grace, be their composition what it may, </l>
            <l n="4.495"> If but with hers performed; climb once again, </l>
            <l n="4.496"> Climb every day, those ramparts; meet the breeze </l>
            <l n="4.497"> Upon their tops, adventurous as a bee </l>
            <l n="4.498"> That from your garden thither soars, to feed </l>
            <l n="4.499"> On new-blown heath; let yon commanding rock </l>
            <l n="4.500"> Be your frequented watch-tower; roll the stone </l>
            <l n="4.501"> In thunder down the mountains; with all your might </l>
            <l n="4.502"> Chase the wild goat; and if the bold red deer </l>
            <l n="4.503"> Fly to those harbours, driven by hound and horn </l>
            <l n="4.504"> Loud echoing, add your speed to the pursuit; </l>
            <l n="4.505"> So, wearied to your hut shall you return, </l>
            <l n="4.506"> And sink at evening into sound repose.” </l>
            <l n="4.507">   The Solitary lifted toward the hills </l>
            <l n="4.508"> A kindling eye:—accordant feelings rushed </l>
            <l n="4.509"> Into my bosom, whence these words broke forth: </l>
            <l n="4.510"> “Oh! what a joy it were, in vigorous health, </l>
            <l n="4.511"> To have a body (this our vital frame </l>
            <l n="4.512"> With shrinking sensibility endued, </l>
            <l n="4.513"> And all the nice regards of flesh and blood) </l>
            <l n="4.514"> And to the elements surrender it </l>
            <l n="4.515"> As if it were a spirit!—How divine, </l>
            <l n="4.516"> The liberty, for frail, for mortal, man </l>
            <l n="4.517"> To roam at large among unpeopled glens </l>
            <l n="4.518"> And mountainous retirements, only trod </l>
            <l n="4.519"> By devious footsteps; regions consecrate </l>
            <l n="4.520"> To oldest time! and, reckless of the storm </l>
            <l n="4.521"> That keeps the raven quiet in her nest, </l>
            <l n="4.522"> Be as a presence or a motion—one </l>
            <l n="4.523"> Among the many there; and while the mists </l>
            <l n="4.524"> Flying, and rainy vapours, call out shapes </l>
            <l n="4.525"> And phantoms from the crags and solid earth </l>
            <l n="4.526"> As fast as a musician scatters sounds </l>
            <l n="4.527"> Out of an instrument; and while the streams </l>
            <l n="4.528"> (As at a first creation and in haste </l>
            <l n="4.529"> To exercise their untried faculties) </l>
            <l n="4.530"> Descending from the region of the clouds, </l>
            <l n="4.531"> And starting from the hollows of the earth </l>
            <l n="4.532"> More multitudinous every moment, rend </l>
            <l n="4.533"> Their way before them—what a joy to roam </l>
            <l n="4.534"> An equal among mightiest energies; </l>
            <l n="4.535"> And haply sometimes with articulate voice, </l>
            <l n="4.536"> Amid the deafening tumult, scarcely heard </l>
            <l n="4.537"> By him that utters it, exclaim aloud, </l>
            <l n="4.538"> 'Rage on ye elements! let moon and stars </l>
            <l n="4.539"> Their aspects lend, and mingle in their turn </l>
            <l n="4.540"> With this commotion (ruinous though it be) </l>
            <l n="4.541"> From day to night, from night to day, prolonged!'” </l>
            <l n="4.542">   “Yes,” said the Wanderer, taking from my lips </l>
            <l n="4.543"> The strain of transport, “whosoe'er in youth </l>
            <l n="4.544"> Has, through ambition of his soul, given way </l>
            <l n="4.545"> To such desires, and grasped at such delight, </l>
            <l n="4.546"> Shall feel congenial stirrings late and long, </l>
            <l n="4.547"> In spite of all the weakness that life brings, </l>
            <l n="4.548"> Its cares and sorrows; he, though taught to own </l>

            <l n="4.781">   “Methinks,” persuasively the Sage replied, </l>
            <l n="4.782"> “That for this arduous office you possess </l>
            <l n="4.783"> Some rare advantages. Your early days </l>
            <l n="4.784"> A grateful recollection must supply </l>
            <l n="4.785"> Of much exalted good by Heaven vouchsafed </l>
            <l n="4.786"> To dignify the humblest state.—Your voice </l>
            <l n="4.787"> Hath, in my hearing, often testified </l>

            <l n="4.792"> How feelingly religion may be learned </l>
            <l n="4.793"> In smoky cabins, from a mother's tongue— </l>
            <l n="4.794"> Heard where the dwelling vibrates to the din </l>
            <l n="4.795"> Of the contiguous torrent, gathering strength </l>
            <l n="4.796"> At every moment—and, with strength, increase </l>

            <l n="4.799"> A sightless labourer, whistles at his work— </l>
            <l n="4.800"> Fearful; but resignation tempers fear, </l>
            <l n="4.801"> And piety is sweet to infant minds. </l>

            <l n="4.803"> On the green turf, a dial—to divide </l>

            <l n="4.808"> With less intelligence for 'moral' things </l>
            <l n="4.809"> Of gravest import. Early he perceives, </l>

            <l n="4.811"> Which to the sun of truth he can apply, </l>

            <l n="4.814"> On nature's wants, he knows how few they are, </l>
            <l n="4.815"> And where they lie, how answered and appeased. </l>
            <l n="4.816"> This knowledge ample recompense affords </l>
            <l n="4.817"> For manifold privations; he refers </l>
            <l n="4.818"> His notions to this standard; on this rock </l>

            <l n="4.823"> On fickle pleasures, and superfluous cares, </l>
            <l n="4.824"> And trivial ostentation—is left free </l>

            <l n="4.833"> For noble purposes of mind: his heart </l>
            <l n="4.834"> Beats to the heroic song of ancient days; </l>
            <l n="4.835"> His eye distinguishes, his soul creates. </l>
            <l n="4.836"> And those illusions, which excite the scorn </l>
            <l n="4.837"> Or move the pity of unthinking minds, </l>
            <l n="4.838"> Are they not mainly outward ministers </l>
            <l n="4.839"> Of inward conscience? with whose service charged </l>

            <l n="4.857"> When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear </l>
            <l n="4.858"> A distant strain, far sweeter than the sounds </l>
            <l n="4.859"> Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetched, </l>
            <l n="4.860"> Even from the blazing chariot of the sun, </l>
            <l n="4.861"> A beardless Youth, who touched a golden lute, </l>

            <l n="4.865"> Called on the lovely wanderer who bestowed </l>
            <l n="4.866"> That timely light, to share his joyous sport: </l>
            <l n="4.867"> And hence, a beaming Goddess with her Nymphs, </l>
            <l n="4.868"> Across the lawn and through the darksome grove, </l>

            <l n="4.874"> His thirst from rill or gushing fount, and thanked </l>
            <l n="4.875"> The Naiad. Sunbeams, upon distant hills </l>
            <l n="4.876"> Gliding apace, with shadows in their train, </l>
            <l n="4.877"> Might, with small help from fancy, be transformed </l>

            <l n="4.886"> Of the live deer, or goat's depending beard,— </l>
            <l n="4.887"> These were the lurking Satyrs, a wild brood </l>

            <l n="4.895"> Detains; but tempted now to interpose, </l>
            <l n="4.896"> He with a smile exclaimed:— </l>

            <l n="4.898"> At a safe distance from our native land, </l>
            <l n="4.899"> And from the mansions where our youth was taught. </l>
            <l n="4.900"> The true descendants of those godly men </l>

            <l n="4.904"> The churlish features of that after-race </l>
            <l n="4.905"> Who fled to woods, caverns, and jutting rocks, </l>
            <l n="4.906"> In deadly scorn of superstitious rites, </l>
            <l n="4.907"> Or what their scruples construed to be such— </l>
            <l n="4.908"> How, think you, would they tolerate this scheme </l>
            <l n="4.909"> Of fine propensities, that tends, if urged </l>
            <l n="4.910"> Far as it might be urged, to sow afresh </l>
            <l n="4.911"> The weeds of Romish phantasy, in vain </l>
            <l n="4.912"> Uprooted; would re-consecrate our wells </l>
            <l n="4.913"> To good Saint Fillan and to fair Saint Anne; </l>
            <l n="4.914"> And from long banishment recall Saint Giles, </l>
            <l n="4.915"> To watch again with tutelary love </l>
            <l n="4.916"> O'er stately Edinborough throned on crags? </l>
            <l n="4.917"> A blessed restoration, to behold </l>
            <l n="4.918"> The patron, on the shoulders of his priests, </l>
            <l n="4.919"> Once more parading through her crowded streets, </l>
            <l n="4.920"> Now simply guarded by the sober powers </l>

            <l n="4.922">   This answer followed.—“You have turned my thoughts </l>
            <l n="4.923"> Upon our brave Progenitors, who rose </l>
            <l n="4.924"> Against idolatry with warlike mind, </l>
            <l n="4.925"> And shrunk from vain observances, to lurk </l>
            <l n="4.926"> In woods, and dwell under impending rocks </l>
            <l n="4.927"> Ill-sheltered, and oft wanting fire and food; </l>
            <l n="4.928"> Why?—for this very reason that they felt, </l>
            <l n="4.929"> And did acknowledge, wheresoe'er they moved, </l>
            <l n="4.930"> A spiritual presence, oft-times misconceived, </l>
            <l n="4.931"> But still a high dependence, a divine </l>
            <l n="4.932"> Bounty and government, that filled their hearts </l>
            <l n="4.933"> With joy, and gratitude, and fear, and love; </l>
            <l n="4.934"> And from their fervent lips drew hymns of praise, </l>
            <l n="4.935"> That through the desert rang. Though favoured less, </l>
            <l n="4.936"> Far less, than these, yet such, in their degree, </l>
            <l n="4.937"> Were those bewildered Pagans of old time. </l>
            <l n="4.938"> Beyond their own poor natures and above </l>
            <l n="4.939"> They looked; were humbly thankful for the good </l>
            <l n="4.940"> Which the warm sun solicited, and earth </l>
            <l n="4.941"> Bestowed; were gladsome,—and their moral sense </l>
            <l n="4.942"> They fortified with reverence for the Gods; </l>
            <l n="4.943"> And they had hopes that overstepped the Grave. </l>
            <l n="4.944">   Now, shall our great Discoverers,” he exclaimed, </l>
            <l n="4.945"> Raising his voice triumphantly, “obtain </l>

            <l n="4.961"> Of mighty Nature, if 'twas ever meant </l>
            <l n="4.962"> That we should pry far off yet be unraised; </l>

            <l n="4.968"> With the perverse attempt, while littleness </l>
            <l n="4.969"> May yet become more little; waging thus </l>
            <l n="4.970"> An impious warfare with the very life </l>

            <l n="4.1230"> His sanity of reason not impaired, </l>
            <l n="4.1231"> Say rather, all his thoughts now flowing clear, </l>
            <l n="4.1232"> From a clear fountain flowing, he looks round </l>
            <l n="4.1233"> And seeks for good; and finds the good he seeks: </l>
            <l n="4.1234"> Until abhorrence and contempt are things </l>
            <l n="4.1235"> He only knows by name; and, if he hear, </l>
            <l n="4.1236"> From other mouths, the language which they speak, </l>
            <l n="4.1237"> He is compassionate; and has no thought, </l>
            <l n="4.1238"> No feeling, which can overcome his love. </l>
            <l n="4.1239">   And further; by contemplating these Forms </l>
            <l n="4.1240"> In the relations which they bear to man, </l>
            <l n="4.1241"> He shall discern, how, through the various means </l>
            <l n="4.1242"> Which silently they yield, are multiplied </l>
            <l n="4.1243"> The spiritual presences of absent things. </l>
            <l n="4.1244"> Trust me, that for the instructed, time will come </l>
            <l n="4.1245"> When they shall meet no object but may teach </l>
            <l n="4.1246"> Some acceptable lesson to their minds </l>
            <l n="4.1247"> Of human suffering, or of human joy. </l>
            <l n="4.1248"> So shall they learn, while all things speak of man, </l>
            <l n="4.1249"> Their duties from all forms; and general laws, </l>
            <l n="4.1250"> And local accidents, shall tend alike </l>
            <l n="4.1251"> To rouse, to urge; and, with the will, confer </l>
            <l n="4.1252"> The ability to spread the blessings wide </l>
            <l n="4.1253"> Of true philanthropy. The light of love </l>
            <l n="4.1254"> Not failing, perseverance from their steps </l>
            <l n="4.1255"> Departing not, for them shall be confirmed </l>
            <l n="4.1256"> The glorious habit by which sense is made </l>
            <l n="4.1257"> Subservient still to moral purposes, </l>
            <l n="4.1258"> Auxiliar to divine. That change shall clothe </l>
            <l n="4.1259"> The naked spirit, ceasing to deplore </l>
            <l n="4.1260"> The burthen of existence. Science then </l>
            <l n="4.1261"> Shall be a precious visitant; and then, </l>
            <l n="4.1262"> And only then, be worthy of her name: </l>
            <l n="4.1263"> For then her heart shall kindle; her dull eye, </l>
            <l n="4.1264"> Dull and inanimate, no more shall hang </l>
            <l n="4.1265"> Chained to its object in brute slavery; </l>
            <l n="4.1266"> But taught with patient interest to watch </l>
            <l n="4.1267"> The processes of things, and serve the cause </l>
            <l n="4.1268"> Of order and distinctness, not for this </l>
            <l n="4.1269"> Shall it forget that its most noble use, </l>
            <l n="4.1270"> Its most illustrious province, must be found </l>
            <l n="4.1271"> In furnishing clear guidance, a support </l>
            <l n="4.1272"> Not treacherous, to the mind's 'excursive' power. </l>
            <l n="4.1273"> —So build we up the Being that we are; </l>
            <l n="4.1274"> Thus deeply drinking-in the soul of things </l>
            <l n="4.1275"> We shall be wise perforce; and, while inspired </l>
            <l n="4.1276"> By choice, and conscious that the Will is free, </l>
            <l n="4.1277"> Shall move unswerving, even as if impelled </l>
            <l n="4.1278"> By strict necessity, along the path </l>
            <l n="4.1279"> Of order and of good. Whate'er we see, </l>
            <l n="4.1280"> Or feel, shall tend to quicken and refine; </l>
            <l n="4.1281"> Shall fix, in calmer seats of moral strength, </l>
            <l n="4.1282"> Earthly desires; and raise, to loftier heights </l>
            <l n="4.1283"> Of divine love, our intellectual soul.” </l>
            <l n="4.1284">   Here closed the Sage that eloquent harangue, </l>
            <l n="4.1285"> Poured forth with fervour in continuous stream, </l>
            <l n="4.1286"> Such as, remote, 'mid savage wilderness, </l>
            <l n="4.1287"> An Indian Chief discharges from his breast </l>
            <l n="4.1288"> Into the hearing of assembled tribes, </l>
            <l n="4.1289"> In open circle seated round, and hushed </l>
            <l n="4.1290"> As the unbreathing air, when not a leaf </l>
            <l n="4.1291"> Stirs in the mighty woods.—So did he speak: </l>
            <l n="4.1292"> The words he uttered shall not pass away </l>
            <l n="4.1293"> Dispersed, like music that the wind takes up </l>
            <l n="4.1294"> By snatches, and lets fall, to be forgotten; </l>
            <l n="4.1295"> No—they sank into me, the bounteous gift </l>
            <l n="4.1296"> Of one whom time and nature had made wise, </l>
            <l n="4.1297"> Gracing his doctrine with authority </l>
            <l n="4.1298"> Which hostile spirits silently allow; </l>
            <l n="4.1299"> Of one accustomed to desires that feed </l>
            <l n="4.1300"> On fruitage gathered from the tree of life; </l>
            <l n="4.1301"> To hopes on knowledge and experience built; </l>
            <l n="4.1302"> Of one in whom persuasion and belief </l>
            <l n="4.1303"> Had ripened into faith, and faith become </l>
            <l n="4.1304"> A passionate intuition; whence the Soul, </l>
            <l n="4.1305"> Though bound to earth by ties of pity and love, </l>
            <l n="4.1306"> From all injurious servitude was free. </l>
            <l n="4.1307">   The Sun, before his place of rest were reached, </l>
            <l n="4.1308"> Had yet to travel far, but unto us, </l>
            <l n="4.1309"> To us who stood low in that hollow dell, </l>
            <l n="4.1310"> He had become invisible,—a pomp </l>
            <l n="4.1311"> Leaving behind of yellow radiance spread </l>
            <l n="4.1312"> Over the mountain sides, in contrast bold </l>
            <l n="4.1313"> With ample shadows, seemingly, no less </l>
            <l n="4.1314"> Than those resplendent lights, his rich bequest; </l>
            <l n="4.1315"> A dispensation of his evening power. </l>
            <l n="4.1316"> —Adown the path that from the glen had led </l>
            <l n="4.1317"> The funeral train, the Shepherd and his Mate </l>
            <l n="4.1318"> Were seen descending:—forth to greet them ran </l>
            <l n="4.1319"> Our little Page: the rustic pair approach; </l>
            <l n="4.1320"> And in the Matron's countenance may be read </l>
            <l n="4.1321"> Plain indication that the words, which told </l>

            <l n="4.1323"> Before his time into a quiet grave, </l>
            <l n="4.1324"> Had done to her humanity no wrong: </l>

            <l n="4.1326"> With ostentatious zeal.—Along the floor </l>
            <l n="4.1327"> Of the small Cottage in the lonely Dell </l>
            <l n="4.1328"> A grateful couch was spread for our repose; </l>

            <l n="4.1331"> Of far-off torrents charming the still night, </l>

            <head>THE PASTOR</head>
            <head>ARGUMENT</head>
            <p>Farewell to the Valley—Reflections—A large and populous Vale 
described—The Pastor's Dwelling, and some account of him—Church 
and Monuments—The Solitary musing, and where—Roused—In the 
Churchyard the Solitary communicates the thoughts which had 
recently passed through his mind—Lofty tone of the Wanderer's 
discourse of yesterday adverted to—Rite of Baptism, and the 
professions accompanying it, contrasted with the real state of 
human life—Apology for the Rite—Inconsistency of the best men— 
Acknowledgment that practice falls far below the injunctions of 
duty as existing in the mind—General complaint of a falling-off 
in the value of life after the time of youth—Outward appearances 
of content and happiness in degree illusive—Pastor approaches— 
Appeal made to him—His answer—Wanderer in sympathy with him— 
Suggestion that the least ambitious enquirers may be most free 
from error—The Pastor is desired to give some portraits of the 
living or dead from his own observation of life among these 
Mountains—And for what purpose—Pastor consents—Mountain 
cottage—Excellent qualities of its Inhabitants—Solitary 
expresses his pleasure; but denies the praise of virtue to worth 
of this kind—Feelings of the Priest before he enters upon his 
account of persons interred in the Churchyard—Graves of 
unbaptized Infants—Funeral and sepulchral observances, whence— 
Ecclesiastical Establishments, whence derived—Profession of 
belief in the doctrine of Immortality.

            <l n="5.1"> “FAREWELL, deep Valley, with thy one rude House, </l>
            <l n="5.2"> And its small lot of life-supporting fields, </l>
            <l n="5.3"> And guardian rocks!—Farewell, attractive seat! </l>
            <l n="5.4"> To the still influx of the morning light </l>
            <l n="5.5"> Open, and day's pure cheerfulness, but veiled </l>
            <l n="5.6"> From human observation, as if yet </l>
            <l n="5.7"> Primeval forests wrapped thee round with dark </l>
            <l n="5.8"> Impenetrable shade; once more farewell, </l>
            <l n="5.9"> Majestic circuit, beautiful abyss, </l>
            <l n="5.10"> By Nature destined from the birth of things </l>
            <l n="5.11"> For quietness profound!” </l>
            <l n="5.12">                           Upon the side </l>
            <l n="5.13"> Of that brown ridge, sole outlet of the vale </l>
            <l n="5.14"> Which foot of boldest stranger would attempt, </l>
            <l n="5.15"> Lingering behind my comrades, thus I breathed </l>
            <l n="5.16"> A parting tribute to a spot that seemed </l>
            <l n="5.17"> Like the fixed centre of a troubled world. </l>
            <l n="5.18"> Again I halted with reverted eyes; </l>
            <l n="5.19"> The chain that would not slacken, was at length </l>
            <l n="5.20"> Snapt,—and, pursuing leisurely my way, </l>
            <l n="5.21"> How vain, thought I, is it by change of place </l>
            <l n="5.22"> To seek that comfort which the mind denies; </l>
            <l n="5.23"> Yet trial and temptation oft are shunned </l>
            <l n="5.24"> Wisely; and by such tenure do we hold </l>
            <l n="5.25"> Frail life's possessions, that even they whose fate </l>
            <l n="5.26"> Yields no peculiar reason of complaint </l>
            <l n="5.27"> Might, by the promise that is here, be won </l>
            <l n="5.28"> To steal from active duties, and embrace </l>
            <l n="5.29"> Obscurity, and undisturbed repose. </l>
            <l n="5.30"> —Knowledge, methinks, in these disordered times, </l>
            <l n="5.31"> Should be allowed a privilege to have </l>
            <l n="5.32"> Her anchorites, like piety of old; </l>
            <l n="5.33"> Men, who, from faction sacred, and unstained </l>
            <l n="5.34"> By war, might, if so minded, turn aside </l>
            <l n="5.35"> Uncensured, and subsist, a scattered few </l>
            <l n="5.36"> Living to God and nature, and content </l>
            <l n="5.37"> With that communion. Consecrated be </l>
            <l n="5.38"> The spots where such abide! But happier still </l>
            <l n="5.39"> The Man, whom, furthermore, a hope attends </l>
            <l n="5.40"> That meditation and research may guide </l>
            <l n="5.41"> His privacy to principles and powers </l>
            <l n="5.42"> Discovered or invented; or set forth, </l>
            <l n="5.43"> Through his acquaintance with the ways of truth, </l>
            <l n="5.44"> In lucid order; so that, when his course </l>
            <l n="5.45"> Is run, some faithful eulogist may say, </l>
            <l n="5.46"> He sought not praise, and praise did overlook </l>
            <l n="5.47"> His unobtrusive merit; but his life, </l>
            <l n="5.48"> Sweet to himself, was exercised in good </l>
            <l n="5.49"> That shall survive his name and memory. </l>
            <l n="5.50">   Acknowledgments of gratitude sincere </l>
            <l n="5.51"> Accompanied these musings; fervent thanks </l>
            <l n="5.52"> For my own peaceful lot and happy choice; </l>
            <l n="5.53"> A choice that from the passions of the world </l>
            <l n="5.54"> Withdrew, and fixed me in a still retreat; </l>
            <l n="5.55"> Sheltered, but not to social duties lost, </l>
            <l n="5.56"> Secluded, but not buried; and with song </l>
            <l n="5.57"> Cheering my days, and with industrious thought; </l>
            <l n="5.58"> With the ever-welcome company of books; </l>
            <l n="5.59"> With virtuous friendship's soul-sustaining aid, </l>
            <l n="5.60"> And with the blessings of domestic love. </l>
            <l n="5.61">   Thus occupied in mind I paced along, </l>
            <l n="5.62"> Following the rugged road, by sledge or wheel </l>
            <l n="5.63"> Worn in the moorland, till I overtook </l>
            <l n="5.64"> My two Associates, in the morning sunshine </l>
            <l n="5.65"> Halting together on a rocky knoll, </l>
            <l n="5.66"> Whence the bare road descended rapidly </l>
            <l n="5.67"> To the green meadows of another vale. </l>
            <l n="5.68">   Here did our pensive Host put forth his hand </l>
            <l n="5.69"> In sign of farewell. “Nay,” the old Man said, </l>
            <l n="5.70"> “The fragrant air its coolness still retains; </l>
            <l n="5.71"> The herds and flocks are yet abroad to crop </l>
            <l n="5.72"> The dewy grass; you cannot leave us now, </l>
            <l n="5.73"> We must not part at this inviting hour.” </l>
            <l n="5.74"> He yielded, though reluctant; for his mind </l>
            <l n="5.75"> Instinctively disposed him to retire </l>
            <l n="5.76"> To his own covert; as a billow, heaved </l>
            <l n="5.77"> Upon the beach, rolls back into the sea. </l>
            <l n="5.78"> —So we descend: and winding round a rock </l>
            <l n="5.79"> Attain a point that showed the valley—stretched </l>
            <l n="5.80"> In length before us; and, not distant far, </l>
            <l n="5.81"> Upon a rising ground a grey church-tower, </l>
            <l n="5.82"> Whose battlements were screened by tufted trees. </l>
            <l n="5.83"> And towards a crystal Mere, that lay beyond </l>
            <l n="5.84"> Among steep hills and woods embosomed, flowed </l>
            <l n="5.85"> A copious stream with boldly-winding course; </l>
            <l n="5.86"> Here traceable, there hidden—there again </l>
            <l n="5.87"> To sight restored, and glittering in the sun. </l>
            <l n="5.88"> On the stream's bank, and everywhere, appeared </l>
            <l n="5.89"> Fair dwellings, single, or in social knots; </l>
            <l n="5.90"> Some scattered o'er the level, others perched </l>
            <l n="5.91"> On the hill sides, a cheerful quiet scene, </l>
            <l n="5.92"> Now in its morning purity arrayed. </l>
            <l n="5.93">   “As 'mid some happy valley of the Alps,” </l>
            <l n="5.94"> Said I, “once happy, ere tyrannic power, </l>
            <l n="5.95"> Wantonly breaking in upon the Swiss, </l>
            <l n="5.96"> Destroyed their unoffending commonwealth, </l>
            <l n="5.97"> A popular equality reigns here, </l>
            <l n="5.98"> Save for yon stately House beneath whose roof </l>
            <l n="5.99"> A rural lord might dwell.”—“No feudal pomp, </l>
            <l n="5.100"> Or power,” replied the Wanderer, “to that House </l>
            <l n="5.101"> Belongs, but there in his allotted Home </l>
            <l n="5.102"> Abides, from year to year, a genuine Priest, </l>
            <l n="5.103"> The shepherd of his flock; or, as a king </l>
            <l n="5.104"> Is styled, when most affectionately praised, </l>
            <l n="5.105"> The father of his people. Such is he; </l>
            <l n="5.106"> And rich and poor, and young and old, rejoice </l>
            <l n="5.107"> Under his spiritual sway. He hath vouchsafed </l>
            <l n="5.108"> To me some portion of a kind regard; </l>
            <l n="5.109"> And something also of his inner mind </l>
            <l n="5.110"> Hath he imparted—but I speak of him </l>
            <l n="5.111"> As he is known to all. </l>
            <l n="5.112">                         The calm delights </l>
            <l n="5.113"> Of unambitious piety he chose, </l>
            <l n="5.114"> And learning's solid dignity; though born </l>
            <l n="5.115"> Of knightly race, nor wanting powerful friends. </l>
            <l n="5.116"> Hither, in prime of manhood, he withdrew </l>
            <l n="5.117"> From academic bowers. He loved the spot— </l>
            <l n="5.118"> Who does not love his native soil?—he prized </l>
            <l n="5.119"> The ancient rural character, composed </l>
            <l n="5.120"> Of simple manners, feelings unsupprest </l>
            <l n="5.121"> And undisguised, and strong and serious thought </l>
            <l n="5.122"> A character reflected in himself, </l>
            <l n="5.123"> With such embellishment as well beseems </l>
            <l n="5.124"> His rank and sacred function. This deep vale </l>
            <l n="5.125"> Winds far in reaches hidden from our sight, </l>
            <l n="5.126"> And one a turreted manorial hall </l>
            <l n="5.127"> Adorns, in which the good Man's ancestors </l>
            <l n="5.128"> Have dwelt through ages, Patrons of this Cure. </l>
            <l n="5.129"> To them, and to his own judicious pains, </l>
            <l n="5.130"> The Vicar's dwelling, and the whole domain, </l>
            <l n="5.131"> Owes that presiding aspect which might well </l>
            <l n="5.132"> Attract your notice; statelier than could else </l>
            <l n="5.133"> Have been bestowed, through course of common chance, </l>
            <l n="5.134"> On an unwealthy mountain Benefice.” </l>
            <l n="5.135">   This said, oft pausing, we pursued our way; </l>
            <l n="5.136"> Nor reached the village-churchyard till the sun </l>
            <l n="5.137"> Travelling at steadier pace than ours, had risen </l>
            <l n="5.138"> Above the summits of the highest hills, </l>
            <l n="5.139"> And round our path darted oppressive beams. </l>
            <l n="5.140">   As chanced, the portals of the sacred Pile </l>
            <l n="5.141"> Stood open; and we entered. On my frame, </l>
            <l n="5.142"> At such transition from the fervid air, </l>
            <l n="5.143"> A grateful coolness fell, that seemed to strike </l>
            <l n="5.144"> The heart, in concert with that temperate awe </l>
            <l n="5.145"> And natural reverence which the place inspired. </l>
            <l n="5.146"> Not raised in nice proportions was the pile, </l>
            <l n="5.147"> But large and massy; for duration built; </l>
            <l n="5.148"> With pillars crowded, and the roof upheld </l>
            <l n="5.149"> By naked rafters intricately crossed, </l>
            <l n="5.150"> Like leafless underboughs, in some thick wood, </l>
            <l n="5.151"> All withered by the depth of shade above. </l>
            <l n="5.152"> Admonitory texts inscribed the walls, </l>
            <l n="5.153"> Each, in its ornamental scroll, enclosed; </l>
            <l n="5.154"> Each also crowned with winged heads—a pair </l>
            <l n="5.155"> Of rudely-painted Cherubim. The floor </l>
            <l n="5.156"> Of nave and aisle, in unpretending guise, </l>
            <l n="5.157"> Was occupied by oaken benches ranged </l>
            <l n="5.158"> In seemly rows; the chancel only showed </l>
            <l n="5.159"> Some vain distinctions, marks of earthly state </l>
            <l n="5.160"> By immemorial privilege allowed; </l>
            <l n="5.161"> Though with the Encincture's special sanctity </l>
            <l n="5.162"> But ill according. An heraldic shield, </l>
            <l n="5.163"> Varying its tincture with the changeful light, </l>
            <l n="5.164"> Imbued the altar-window; fixed aloft </l>
            <l n="5.165"> A faded hatchment hung, and one by time </l>
            <l n="5.166"> Yet undiscoloured. A capacious pew </l>
            <l n="5.167"> Of sculptured oak stood here, with drapery lined; </l>
            <l n="5.168"> And marble monuments were here displayed </l>
            <l n="5.169"> Thronging the walls; and on the floor beneath </l>
            <l n="5.170"> Sepulchral stones appeared, with emblems graven </l>
            <l n="5.171"> And foot-worn epitaphs, and some with small </l>
            <l n="5.172"> And shining effigies of brass inlaid. </l>
            <l n="5.173">   The tribute by these various records claimed, </l>
            <l n="5.174"> Duly we paid, each after each, and read </l>
            <l n="5.175"> The ordinary chronicle of birth, </l>
            <l n="5.176"> Office, alliance, and promotion—all </l>
            <l n="5.177"> Ending in dust; of upright magistrates, </l>
            <l n="5.178"> Grave doctors strenuous for the mother-church, </l>
            <l n="5.179"> And uncorrupted senators, alike </l>
            <l n="5.180"> To king and people true. A brazen plate, </l>
            <l n="5.181"> Not easily deciphered, told of one </l>
            <l n="5.182"> Whose course of earthly honour was begun </l>
            <l n="5.183"> In quality of page among the train </l>
            <l n="5.184"> Of the eighth Henry, when he crossed the seas </l>
            <l n="5.185"> His royal state to show, and prove his strength </l>
            <l n="5.186"> In tournament, upon the fields of France. </l>
            <l n="5.187"> Another tablet registered the death, </l>
            <l n="5.188"> And praised the gallant bearing, of a Knight </l>
            <l n="5.189"> Tried in the sea-fights of the second Charles. </l>
            <l n="5.190"> Near this brave Knight his Father lay entombed; </l>
            <l n="5.191"> And, to the silent language giving voice, </l>
            <l n="5.192"> I read,—how in his manhood's earlier day </l>
            <l n="5.193"> He, 'mid the afflictions of intestine war </l>
            <l n="5.194"> And rightful government subverted, found </l>
            <l n="5.195"> One only solace—that he had espoused </l>
            <l n="5.196"> A virtuous Lady tenderly beloved </l>
            <l n="5.197"> For her benign perfections; and yet more </l>
            <l n="5.198"> Endeared to him, for this, that, in her state </l>
            <l n="5.199"> Of wedlock richly crowned with Heaven's regard, </l>
            <l n="5.200"> She with a numerous issue filled his house, </l>
            <l n="5.201"> Who throve, like plants, uninjured by the storm </l>
            <l n="5.202"> That laid their country waste. No need to speak </l>
            <l n="5.203"> Of less particular notices assigned </l>
            <l n="5.204"> To Youth or Maiden gone before their time, </l>
            <l n="5.205"> And Matrons and unwedded Sisters old; </l>
            <l n="5.206"> Whose charity and goodness were rehearsed </l>
            <l n="5.207"> In modest panegyric. </l>
            <l n="5.208">                       “These dim lines, </l>
            <l n="5.209"> What would they tell?” said I,—but, from the task </l>
            <l n="5.210"> Of puzzling out that faded narrative, </l>
            <l n="5.211"> With whisper soft my venerable Friend </l>
            <l n="5.212"> Called me; and, looking down the darksome aisle, </l>
            <l n="5.213"> I saw the Tenant of the lonely vale </l>
            <l n="5.214"> Standing apart; with curved arm reclined </l>
            <l n="5.215"> On the baptismal font; his pallid face </l>
            <l n="5.216"> Upturned, as if his mind were rapt, or lost </l>
            <l n="5.217"> In some abstraction;—gracefully he stood, </l>
            <l n="5.218"> The semblance bearing of a sculptured form </l>
            <l n="5.219"> That leans upon a monumental urn </l>
            <l n="5.220"> In peace, from morn to night, from year to year. </l>
            <l n="5.221">   Him from that posture did the Sexton rouse; </l>
            <l n="5.222"> Who entered, humming carelessly a tune, </l>
            <l n="5.223"> Continuation haply of the notes </l>
            <l n="5.224"> That had beguiled the work from which he came, </l>
            <l n="5.225"> With spade and mattock o'er his shoulder hung; </l>
            <l n="5.226"> To be deposited, for future need, </l>
            <l n="5.227"> In their appointed place. The pale Recluse </l>
            <l n="5.228"> Withdrew; and straight we followed,—to a spot </l>
            <l n="5.229"> Where sun and shade were intermixed; for there </l>
            <l n="5.230"> A broad oak, stretching forth its leafy arms </l>
            <l n="5.231"> From an adjoining pasture, overhung </l>
            <l n="5.232"> Small space of that green churchyard with a light </l>
            <l n="5.233"> And pleasant awning. On the moss-grown wall </l>
            <l n="5.234"> My ancient Friend and I together took </l>
            <l n="5.235"> Our seats; and thus the Solitary spake, </l>
            <l n="5.236"> Standing before us:— </l>
            <l n="5.237">                        “Did you note the mien </l>
            <l n="5.238"> Of that self-solaced, easy-hearted churl, </l>
            <l n="5.239"> Death's hireling, who scoops out his neighbour's grave, </l>
            <l n="5.240"> Or wraps an old acquaintance up in clay, </l>
            <l n="5.241"> All unconcerned as he would bind a sheaf, </l>
            <l n="5.242"> Or plant a tree. And did you hear his voice? </l>
            <l n="5.243"> I was abruptly summoned by the sound </l>
            <l n="5.244"> From some affecting images and thoughts, </l>
            <l n="5.245"> Which then were silent; but crave utterance now. </l>
            <l n="5.246">   Much,” he continued, with dejected look, </l>
            <l n="5.247"> “Much, yesterday, was said in glowing phrase, </l>
            <l n="5.248"> Of our sublime dependencies, and hopes </l>
            <l n="5.249"> For future states of being; and the wings </l>
            <l n="5.250"> Of speculation, joyfully outspread, </l>
            <l n="5.251"> Hovered above our destiny on earth: </l>
            <l n="5.252"> But stoop, and place the prospect of the soul </l>
            <l n="5.253"> In sober contrast with reality, </l>
            <l n="5.254"> And man's substantial life. If this mute earth </l>
            <l n="5.255"> Of what it holds could speak, and every grave </l>
            <l n="5.256"> Were as a volume, shut, yet capable </l>
            <l n="5.257"> Of yielding its contents to eye and ear, </l>
            <l n="5.258"> We should recoil, stricken with sorrow and shame, </l>
            <l n="5.259"> To see disclosed, by such dread proof, how ill </l>
            <l n="5.260"> That which is done accords with what is known </l>
            <l n="5.261"> To reason, and by conscience is enjoined; </l>
            <l n="5.262"> How idly, how perversely, life's whole course, </l>
            <l n="5.263"> To this conclusion, deviates from the line, </l>
            <l n="5.264"> Or of the end stops short, proposed to all </l>
            <l n="5.265"> At her aspiring outset. </l>
            <l n="5.266">                          Mark the babe </l>
            <l n="5.267"> Not long accustomed to this breathing world; </l>
            <l n="5.268"> One that hath barely learned to shape a smile, </l>
            <l n="5.269"> Though yet irrational of soul, to grasp </l>
            <l n="5.270"> With tiny finger—to let fall a tear; </l>
            <l n="5.271"> And, as the heavy cloud of sleep dissolves, </l>
            <l n="5.272"> To stretch his limbs, bemocking, as might seem, </l>
            <l n="5.273"> The outward functions of intelligent man; </l>
            <l n="5.274"> A grave proficient in amusive feats </l>
            <l n="5.275"> Of puppetry, that from the lap declare </l>
            <l n="5.276"> His expectations, and announce his claims </l>
            <l n="5.277"> To that inheritance which millions rue </l>
            <l n="5.278"> That they were ever born to! In due time </l>
            <l n="5.279"> A day of solemn ceremonial comes; </l>
            <l n="5.280"> When they, who for this Minor hold in trust </l>
            <l n="5.281"> Rights that transcend the loftiest heritage </l>
            <l n="5.282"> Of mere humanity, present their Charge, </l>
            <l n="5.283"> For this occasion daintily adorned, </l>
            <l n="5.284"> At the baptismal font. And when the pure </l>
            <l n="5.285"> And consecrating element hath cleansed </l>
            <l n="5.286"> The original stain, the child is there received </l>
            <l n="5.287"> Into the second ark, Christ's church, with trust </l>
            <l n="5.288"> That he, from wrath redeemed, therein shall float </l>
            <l n="5.289"> Over the billows of this troublesome world </l>
            <l n="5.290"> To the fair land of everlasting life. </l>
            <l n="5.291"> Corrupt affections, covetous desires, </l>
            <l n="5.292"> Are all renounced; high as the thought of man </l>
            <l n="5.293"> Can carry virtue, virtue is professed; </l>
            <l n="5.294"> A dedication made, a promise given </l>
            <l n="5.295"> For due provision to control and guide, </l>
            <l n="5.296"> And unremitting progress to ensure </l>
            <l n="5.297"> In holiness and truth.” </l>
            <l n="5.298">                          “You cannot blame,” </l>
            <l n="5.299"> Here interposing fervently I said, </l>
            <l n="5.300"> “Rites which attest that Man by nature lies </l>
            <l n="5.301"> Bedded for good and evil in a gulf </l>
            <l n="5.302"> Fearfully low; nor will your judgment scorn </l>
            <l n="5.303"> Those services, whereby attempt is made </l>
            <l n="5.304"> To lift the creature toward that eminence </l>
            <l n="5.305"> On which, now fallen, erewhile in majesty </l>
            <l n="5.306"> He stood; or if not so, whose top serene </l>
            <l n="5.307"> At least he feels 'tis given him to descry; </l>
            <l n="5.308"> Not without aspirations, evermore </l>
            <l n="5.309"> Returning, and injunctions from within </l>
            <l n="5.310"> Doubt to cast off and weariness; in trust </l>
            <l n="5.311"> That what the Soul perceives, if glory lost, </l>
            <l n="5.312"> May be, through pains and persevering hope, </l>
            <l n="5.313"> Recovered; or, if hitherto unknown, </l>
            <l n="5.314"> Lies within reach, and one day shall be gained.” </l>
            <l n="5.315">   “I blame them not,” he calmly answered—“no; </l>
            <l n="5.316"> The outward ritual and established forms </l>
            <l n="5.317"> With which communities of men invest </l>
            <l n="5.318"> These inward feelings, and the aspiring vows </l>
            <l n="5.319"> To which the lips give public utterance </l>
            <l n="5.320"> Are both a natural process; and by me </l>
            <l n="5.321"> Shall pass uncensured; though the issue prove, </l>
            <l n="5.322"> Bringing from age to age its own reproach, </l>
            <l n="5.323"> Incongruous, impotent, and blank.—But, oh! </l>
            <l n="5.324"> If to be weak is to be wretched—miserable, </l>
            <l n="5.325"> As the lost Angel by a human voice </l>
            <l n="5.326"> Hath mournfully pronounced, then, in my mind, </l>
            <l n="5.327"> Far better not to move at all than move </l>
            <l n="5.328"> By impulse sent from such illusive power,— </l>
            <l n="5.329"> That finds and cannot fasten down; that grasps </l>
            <l n="5.330"> And is rejoiced, and loses while it grasps; </l>
            <l n="5.331"> That tempts, emboldens—for a time sustains, </l>
            <l n="5.332"> And then betrays; accuses and inflicts </l>
            <l n="5.333"> Remorseless punishment; and so retreads </l>
            <l n="5.334"> The inevitable circle: better far </l>
            <l n="5.335"> Than this, to graze the herb in thoughtless peace, </l>
            <l n="5.336"> By foresight or remembrance, undisturbed! </l>
            <l n="5.337">   Philosophy! and thou more vaunted name </l>

            <l n="5.369"> Of contradiction, from some vague desire </l>

            <l n="5.415"> Of outward sunshine and internal warmth; </l>
            <l n="5.416"> And, with this change, sharp air and falling leaves, </l>
            <l n="5.417"> Foretelling aged Winter's desolate sway. </l>

            <l n="5.420"> To give assurance of content within; </l>
            <l n="5.421"> Embosomed happiness, and placid love; </l>
            <l n="5.422"> As if the sunshine of the day were met </l>

            <l n="5.433"> Of a good shepherd tended as themselves </l>
            <l n="5.434"> Do tend their flocks) partake man's general lot </l>
            <l n="5.435"> With little mitigation. They escape, </l>
            <l n="5.436"> Perchance, the heavier woes of guilt; feel not </l>
            <l n="5.437"> The tedium of fantastic idleness: </l>
            <l n="5.438"> Yet life, as with the multitude, with them </l>
            <l n="5.439"> Is fashioned like an ill-constructed tale; </l>

            <l n="5.443"> Old things repeated with diminished grace; </l>
            <l n="5.444"> And all the laboured novelties at best </l>
            <l n="5.445"> Imperfect substitutes, whose use and power </l>
            <l n="5.446"> Evince the want and weakness whence they spring.” </l>
            <l n="5.447">   While in this serious mood we held discourse, </l>
            <l n="5.448"> The reverend Pastor toward the churchyard gate </l>
            <l n="5.449"> Approached; and, with a mild respectful air </l>
            <l n="5.450"> Of native cordiality, our Friend </l>
            <l n="5.451"> Advanced to greet him. With a gracious mien </l>
            <l n="5.452"> Was he received, and mutual joy prevailed. </l>
            <l n="5.453"> Awhile they stood in conference, and I guess </l>
            <l n="5.454"> That he, who now upon the mossy wall </l>
            <l n="5.455"> Sate by my side, had vanished, if a wish </l>
            <l n="5.456"> Could have transferred him to the flying clouds, </l>
            <l n="5.457"> Or the least penetrable hiding-place </l>
            <l n="5.458"> In his own valley's rocky guardianship. </l>
            <l n="5.459"> —For me, I looked upon the pair, well pleased: </l>
            <l n="5.460"> Nature had framed them both, and both were marked </l>
            <l n="5.461"> By circumstance, with intermixture fine </l>
            <l n="5.462"> Of contrast and resemblance. To an oak </l>
            <l n="5.463"> Hardy and grand, a weather-beaten oak, </l>
            <l n="5.464"> Fresh in the strength and majesty of age, </l>
            <l n="5.465"> One might be likened: flourishing appeared, </l>
            <l n="5.466"> Though somewhat past the fulness of his prime, </l>
            <l n="5.467"> The other—like a stately sycamore, </l>
            <l n="5.468"> That spreads, in gentle pomp, its honied shade. </l>
            <l n="5.469">   A general greeting was exchanged; and soon </l>
            <l n="5.470"> The Pastor learned that his approach had given </l>
            <l n="5.471"> A welcome interruption to discourse </l>
            <l n="5.472"> Grave, and in truth too often sad.—“Is Man </l>
            <l n="5.473"> A child of hope? Do generations press </l>
            <l n="5.474"> On generations, without progress made? </l>
            <l n="5.475"> Halts the individual, ere his hairs be grey, </l>
            <l n="5.476"> Perforce? Are we a creature in whom good </l>
            <l n="5.477"> Preponderates, or evil? Doth the will </l>
            <l n="5.478"> Acknowledge reason's law? A living power </l>
            <l n="5.479"> Is virtue, or no better than a name, </l>
            <l n="5.480"> Fleeting as health or beauty, and unsound? </l>
            <l n="5.481"> So that the only substance which remains, </l>
            <l n="5.482"> (For thus the tenor of complaint hath run) </l>
            <l n="5.483"> Among so many shadows, are the pains </l>
            <l n="5.484"> And penalties of miserable life, </l>
            <l n="5.485"> Doomed to decay, and then expire in dust! </l>
            <l n="5.486"> —Our cogitations, this way have been drawn, </l>
            <l n="5.487"> These are the points,” the Wanderer said, “on which </l>
            <l n="5.488"> Our inquest turns.—Accord, good Sir! the light </l>
            <l n="5.489"> Of your experience to dispel this gloom: </l>
            <l n="5.490"> By your persuasive wisdom shall the heart </l>
            <l n="5.491"> That frets, or languishes, be stilled and cheered.” </l>
            <l n="5.492">   “Our nature,” said the Priest, in mild reply, </l>
            <l n="5.493"> “Angels nay weigh and fathom: they perceive, </l>
            <l n="5.494"> With undistempered and unclouded spirit, </l>
            <l n="5.495"> The object as it is; but, for ourselves, </l>
            <l n="5.496"> That speculative height 'we' may not reach. </l>
            <l n="5.497"> The good and evil are our own; and we </l>
            <l n="5.498"> Are that which we would contemplate from far. </l>
            <l n="5.499"> Knowledge, for us, is difficult to gain— </l>
            <l n="5.500"> Is difficult to gain, and hard to keep— </l>
            <l n="5.501"> As virtue's self; like virtue is beset </l>
            <l n="5.502"> With snares; tried, tempted, subject to decay. </l>
            <l n="5.503"> Love, admiration, fear, desire, and hate, </l>
            <l n="5.504"> Blind were we without these: through these alone </l>
            <l n="5.505"> Are capable to notice or discern </l>
            <l n="5.506"> Or to record; we judge, but cannot be </l>
            <l n="5.507"> Indifferent judges. 'Spite of proudest boast, </l>
            <l n="5.508"> Reason, best reason, is to imperfect man </l>
            <l n="5.509"> An effort only, and a noble aim; </l>
            <l n="5.510"> A crown, an attribute of sovereign power, </l>
            <l n="5.511"> Still to be courted—never to be won. </l>
            <l n="5.512"> —Look forth, or each man dive into himself; </l>

            <l n="5.516"> Hopes rashly, in disgust as rash recoils; </l>
            <l n="5.517"> Battens on spleen, or moulders in despair; </l>
            <l n="5.518"> Thus comprehension fails, and truth is missed; </l>
            <l n="5.519"> Thus darkness and delusion round our path </l>
            <l n="5.520"> Spread, from disease, whose subtle injury lurks </l>
            <l n="5.521"> Within the very faculty of sight. </l>
            <l n="5.522">   Yet for the general purposes of faith </l>
            <l n="5.523"> In Providence, for solace and support, </l>
            <l n="5.524"> We may not doubt that who can best subject </l>
            <l n="5.525"> The will to reason's law, can strictliest live </l>
            <l n="5.526"> And act in that obedience, he shall gain </l>
            <l n="5.527"> The clearest apprehension of those truths, </l>
            <l n="5.528"> Which unassisted reason's utmost power </l>
            <l n="5.529"> Is too infirm to reach. But, waiving this, </l>
            <l n="5.530"> And our regards confining within bounds </l>
            <l n="5.531"> Of less exalted consciousness, through which </l>
            <l n="5.532"> The very multitude are free to range, </l>
            <l n="5.533"> We safely may affirm that human life </l>
            <l n="5.534"> Is either fair and tempting, a soft scene </l>
            <l n="5.535"> Grateful to sight, refreshing to the soul, </l>
            <l n="5.536"> Or a forbidden tract of cheerless view; </l>
            <l n="5.537"> Even as the same is looked at, or approached. </l>
            <l n="5.538"> Thus, when in changeful April fields are white </l>
            <l n="5.539"> With new-fallen snow, if from the sullen north </l>

            <l n="5.541"> Hath gained his noontide height, this churchyard, filled </l>
            <l n="5.542"> With mounds transversely lying side by side </l>
            <l n="5.543"> From east to west, before you will appear </l>
            <l n="5.544"> An unillumined, blank, and dreary plain, </l>
            <l n="5.545"> With more than wintry cheerlessness and gloom </l>
            <l n="5.546"> Saddening the heart. Go forward, and look back; </l>
            <l n="5.547"> Look, from the quarter whence the lord of light, </l>
            <l n="5.548"> Of life, of love, and gladness doth dispense </l>
            <l n="5.549"> His beams; which, unexcluded in their fall, </l>
            <l n="5.550"> Upon the southern side of every grave </l>
            <l n="5.551"> Have gently exercised a melting power; </l>

            <l n="5.555"> That overspread and chilled the sacred turf, </l>
            <l n="5.556"> Vanished or hidden; and the whole domain, </l>
            <l n="5.557"> To some, too lightly minded, might appear </l>
            <l n="5.558"> A meadow carpet for the dancing hours. </l>
            <l n="5.559"> —This contrast, not unsuitable to life, </l>
            <l n="5.560"> Is to that other state more apposite, </l>
            <l n="5.561"> Death and its two-fold aspect! wintry—one, </l>
            <l n="5.562"> Cold, sullen, blank, from hope and joy shut out; </l>
            <l n="5.563"> The other, which the ray divine hath touched, </l>
            <l n="5.564"> Replete with vivid promise, bright as spring.” </l>
            <l n="5.565">   “We see, then, as we feel,” the Wanderer thus </l>
            <l n="5.566"> With a complacent animation spake, </l>
            <l n="5.567"> “And in your judgment, Sir! the mind's repose </l>
            <l n="5.568"> On evidence is not to be ensured </l>
            <l n="5.569"> By act of naked reason. Moral truth </l>
            <l n="5.570"> Is no mechanic structure, built by rule; </l>
            <l n="5.571"> And which, once built, retains a stedfast shape </l>
            <l n="5.572"> And undisturbed proportions; but a thing </l>
            <l n="5.573"> Subject, you deem, to vital accidents; </l>
            <l n="5.574"> And, like the water-lily, lives and thrives, </l>
            <l n="5.575"> Whose root is fixed in stable earth, whose head </l>
            <l n="5.576"> Floats on the tossing waves. With joy sincere </l>
            <l n="5.577"> I re-salute these sentiments confirmed </l>
            <l n="5.578"> By your authority. But how acquire </l>
            <l n="5.579"> The inward principle that gives effect </l>
            <l n="5.580"> To outward argument; the passive will </l>
            <l n="5.581"> Meek to admit; the active energy, </l>
            <l n="5.582"> Strong and unbounded to embrace, and firm </l>
            <l n="5.583"> To keep and cherish? how shall man unite </l>
            <l n="5.584"> With self-forgetting tenderness of heart </l>
            <l n="5.585"> An earth-despising dignity of soul? </l>
            <l n="5.586"> Wise in that union, and without it blind!” </l>
            <l n="5.587">   “The way,” said I, “to court, if not obtain </l>
            <l n="5.588"> The ingenuous mind, apt to be set aright; </l>
            <l n="5.589"> This, in the lonely dell discoursing, you </l>
            <l n="5.590"> Declared at large; and by what exercise </l>
            <l n="5.591"> From visible nature, or the inner self </l>
            <l n="5.592"> Power may be trained, and renovation brought </l>
            <l n="5.593"> To those who need the gift. But, after all, </l>
            <l n="5.594"> Is aught so certain as that man is doomed </l>
            <l n="5.595"> To breathe beneath a vault of ignorance? </l>
            <l n="5.596"> The natural roof of that dark house in which </l>
            <l n="5.597"> His soul is pent! How little can be known— </l>
            <l n="5.598"> This is the wise man's sigh; how far we err— </l>
            <l n="5.599"> This is the good man's not unfrequent pang! </l>
            <l n="5.600"> And they perhaps err least, the lowly class </l>
            <l n="5.601"> Whom a benign necessity compels </l>
            <l n="5.602"> To follow reason's least ambitious course; </l>
            <l n="5.603"> Such do I mean who, unperplexed by doubt, </l>
            <l n="5.604"> And unincited by a wish to look </l>
            <l n="5.605"> Into high objects farther than they may, </l>
            <l n="5.606"> Pace to and fro, from morn till eventide, </l>
            <l n="5.607"> The narrow avenue of daily toil </l>
            <l n="5.608"> For daily bread.” </l>
            <l n="5.609">                    “Yes,” buoyantly exclaimed </l>
            <l n="5.610"> The pale Recluse—“praise to the sturdy plough, </l>
            <l n="5.611"> And patient spade; praise to the simple crook, </l>
            <l n="5.612"> And ponderous loom—resounding while it holds </l>
            <l n="5.613"> Body and mind in one captivity; </l>
            <l n="5.614"> And let the light mechanic tool be hailed </l>
            <l n="5.615"> With honour; which, encasing by the power </l>
            <l n="5.616"> Of long companionship, the artist's hand, </l>
            <l n="5.617"> Cuts off that hand, with all its world of nerves, </l>
            <l n="5.618"> From a too busy commerce with the heart! </l>
            <l n="5.619"> —Inglorious implements of craft and toil, </l>
            <l n="5.620"> Both ye that shape and build, and ye that force, </l>
            <l n="5.621"> By slow solicitation, earth to yield </l>
            <l n="5.622"> Her annual bounty, sparingly dealt forth </l>
            <l n="5.623"> With wise reluctance; you would I extol, </l>
            <l n="5.624"> Not for gross good alone which ye produce, </l>
            <l n="5.625"> But for the impertinent and ceaseless strife </l>
            <l n="5.626"> Of proofs and reasons ye preclude—in those </l>
            <l n="5.627"> Who to your dull society are born, </l>
            <l n="5.628"> And with their humble birthright rest content. </l>
            <l n="5.629"> —Would I had ne'er renounced it!” </l>
            <l n="5.630">                                     A slight flush </l>
            <l n="5.631"> Of moral anger previously had tinged </l>
            <l n="5.632"> The old Man's cheek; but, at this closing turn </l>
            <l n="5.633"> Of self-reproach, it passed away. Said he, </l>
            <l n="5.634"> “That which we feel we utter; as we think </l>
            <l n="5.635"> So have we argued; reaping for our pains </l>
            <l n="5.636"> No visible recompense. For our relief </l>
            <l n="5.637"> You,” to the Pastor turning thus he spake, </l>
            <l n="5.638"> “Have kindly interposed. May I entreat </l>
            <l n="5.639"> Your further help? The mine of real life </l>
            <l n="5.640"> Dig for us; and present us, in the shape </l>
            <l n="5.641"> Of virgin ore, that gold which we, by pains </l>
            <l n="5.642"> Fruitless as those of aery alchemists, </l>
            <l n="5.643"> Seek from the torturing crucible. There lies </l>
            <l n="5.644"> Around us a domain where you have long </l>
            <l n="5.645"> Watched both the outward course and inner heart: </l>
            <l n="5.646"> Give us, for our abstractions, solid facts; </l>
            <l n="5.647"> For our disputes, plain pictures. Say what man </l>
            <l n="5.648"> He is who cultivates yon hanging field; </l>
            <l n="5.649"> What qualities of mind she bears, who comes, </l>
            <l n="5.650"> For morn and evening service, with her pail, </l>
            <l n="5.651"> To that green pasture; place before our sight </l>
            <l n="5.652"> The family who dwell within yon house </l>
            <l n="5.653"> Fenced round with glittering laurel; or in that </l>
            <l n="5.654"> Below, from which the curling smoke ascends. </l>
            <l n="5.655"> Or rather, as we stand on holy earth, </l>
            <l n="5.656"> And have the dead around us, take from them </l>
            <l n="5.657"> Your instances; for they are both best known, </l>
            <l n="5.658"> And by frail man most equitably judged. </l>
            <l n="5.659"> Epitomise the life; pronounce, you can, </l>
            <l n="5.660"> Authentic epitaphs on some of these </l>
            <l n="5.661"> Who, from their lowly mansions hither brought, </l>
            <l n="5.662"> Beneath this turf lie mouldering at our feet: </l>
            <l n="5.663"> So, by your records, may our doubts be solved; </l>
            <l n="5.664"> And so, not searching higher we may learn </l>
            <l n="5.665"> 'To prize the breath we share with human kind; </l>
            <l n="5.666"> And look upon the dust of man with awe'.” </l>
            <l n="5.667">   The Priest replied—“An office you impose </l>
            <l n="5.668"> For which peculiar requisites are mine; </l>
            <l n="5.669"> Yet much, I feel, is wanting—else the task </l>
            <l n="5.670"> Would be most grateful. True indeed it is </l>
            <l n="5.671"> That they whom death has hidden from our sight </l>
            <l n="5.672"> Are worthiest of the mind's regard; with these </l>
            <l n="5.673"> The future cannot contradict the past: </l>
            <l n="5.674"> Mortality's last exercise and proof </l>
            <l n="5.675"> Is undergone; the transit made that shows </l>
            <l n="5.676"> The very Soul, revealed as she departs. </l>
            <l n="5.677"> Yet, on your first suggestion, will I give, </l>
            <l n="5.678"> Ere we descend into these silent vaults, </l>
            <l n="5.679"> One picture from the living. </l>
            <l n="5.680">                               You behold, </l>
            <l n="5.681"> High on the breast of yon dark mountain, dark </l>
            <l n="5.682"> With stony barrenness, a shining speck </l>
            <l n="5.683"> Bright as a sunbeam sleeping till a shower </l>
            <l n="5.684"> Brush it away, or cloud pass over it; </l>
            <l n="5.685"> And such it might be deemed—a sleeping sunbeam; </l>
            <l n="5.686"> But 'tis a plot of cultivated ground, </l>
            <l n="5.687"> Cut off, an island in the dusky waste; </l>
            <l n="5.688"> And that attractive brightness is its own. </l>
            <l n="5.689"> The lofty site, by nature framed to tempt </l>
            <l n="5.690"> Amid a wilderness of rocks and stones </l>
            <l n="5.691"> The tiller's hand, a hermit might have chosen, </l>
            <l n="5.692"> For opportunity presented, thence </l>
            <l n="5.693"> Far forth to send his wandering eye o'er land </l>
            <l n="5.694"> And ocean, and look down upon the works, </l>
            <l n="5.695"> The habitations, and the ways of men, </l>
            <l n="5.696"> Himself unseen! But no tradition tells </l>
            <l n="5.697"> That ever hermit dipped his maple dish </l>
            <l n="5.698"> In the sweet spring that lurks 'mid yon green fields; </l>
            <l n="5.699"> And no such visionary views belong </l>
            <l n="5.700"> To those who occupy and till the ground, </l>
            <l n="5.701"> High on that mountain where they long have dwelt </l>
            <l n="5.702"> A wedded pair in childless solitude. </l>
            <l n="5.703"> A house of stones collected on the spot, </l>
            <l n="5.704"> By rude hands built, with rocky knolls in front. </l>
            <l n="5.705"> Backed also by a ledge of rock, whose crest </l>
            <l n="5.706"> Of birch-trees waves over the chimney top; </l>
            <l n="5.707"> A rough abode—in colour, shape, and size, </l>
            <l n="5.708"> Such as in unsafe times of border-war </l>
            <l n="5.709"> Might have been wished for and contrived, to elude </l>
            <l n="5.710"> The eye of roving plunderer—for their need </l>
            <l n="5.711"> Suffices; and unshaken bears the assault </l>
            <l n="5.712"> Of their most dreaded foe, the strong Southwest </l>
            <l n="5.713"> In anger blowing from the distant sea. </l>
            <l n="5.714"> —Alone within her solitary hut; </l>
            <l n="5.715"> There, or within the compass of her fields, </l>
            <l n="5.716"> At any moment may the Dame be found, </l>
            <l n="5.717"> True as the stock-dove to her shallow nest </l>
            <l n="5.718"> And to the grove that holds it. She beguiles </l>
            <l n="5.719"> By intermingled work of house and field </l>
            <l n="5.720"> The summer's day, and winter's; with success </l>
            <l n="5.721"> Not equal, but sufficient to maintain, </l>
            <l n="5.722"> Even at the worst, a smooth stream of content, </l>
            <l n="5.723"> Until the expected hour at which her Mate </l>
            <l n="5.724"> From the far-distant quarry's vault returns; </l>
            <l n="5.725"> And by his converse crowns a silent day </l>
            <l n="5.726"> With evening cheerfulness. In powers of mind, </l>
            <l n="5.727"> In scale of culture, few among my flock </l>
            <l n="5.728"> Hold lower rank than this sequestered pair: </l>
            <l n="5.729"> But true humility descends from heaven; </l>
            <l n="5.730"> And that best gift of heaven hath fallen on them; </l>
            <l n="5.731"> Abundant recompense for every want. </l>
            <l n="5.732"> —Stoop from your height, ye proud, and copy these! </l>
            <l n="5.733"> Who, in their noiseless dwelling-place, can hear </l>
            <l n="5.734"> The voice of wisdom whispering scripture texts </l>
            <l n="5.735"> For the mind's government, or temper's peace; </l>
            <l n="5.736"> And recommending for their mutual need, </l>
            <l n="5.737"> Forgiveness, patience, hope, and charity!” </l>
            <l n="5.738">   “Much was I pleased,” the grey-haired Wanderer said, </l>
            <l n="5.739"> “When to those shining fields our notice first </l>
            <l n="5.740"> You turned; and yet more pleased have from your lips </l>
            <l n="5.741"> Gathered this fair report of them who dwell </l>
            <l n="5.742"> In that retirement; whither, by such course </l>
            <l n="5.743"> Of evil hap and good as oft awaits </l>
            <l n="5.744"> A tired way-faring man, once 'I' was brought </l>
            <l n="5.745"> While traversing alone yon mountain pass. </l>
            <l n="5.746"> Dark on my road the autumnal evening fell, </l>
            <l n="5.747"> And night succeeded with unusual gloom, </l>
            <l n="5.748"> So hazardous that feet and hands became </l>
            <l n="5.749"> Guides better than mine eyes—until a light </l>
            <l n="5.750"> High in the gloom appeared, too high, methought, </l>
            <l n="5.751"> For human habitation; but I longed </l>
            <l n="5.752"> To reach it, destitute of other hope. </l>
            <l n="5.753"> I looked with steadiness as sailors look </l>
            <l n="5.754"> On the north star, or watch-tower's distant lamp, </l>
            <l n="5.755"> And saw the light—now fixed—and shifting now— </l>
            <l n="5.756"> Not like a dancing meteor, but in line </l>
            <l n="5.757"> Of never-varying motion, to and fro. </l>
            <l n="5.758"> It is no night-fire of the naked hills, </l>
            <l n="5.759"> Thought I—some friendly covert must be near. </l>
            <l n="5.760"> With this persuasion thitherward my steps </l>
            <l n="5.761"> I turn, and reach at last the guiding light; </l>
            <l n="5.762"> Joy to myself! but to the heart of her </l>
            <l n="5.763"> Who there was standing on the open hill, </l>
            <l n="5.764"> (The same kind Matron whom your tongue hath praised) </l>
            <l n="5.765"> Alarm and disappointment! The alarm </l>
            <l n="5.766"> Ceased, when she learned through what mishap I came, </l>
            <l n="5.767"> And by what help had gained those distant fields. </l>
            <l n="5.768"> Drawn from her cottage, on that aery height, </l>
            <l n="5.769"> Bearing a lantern in her hand she stood, </l>
            <l n="5.770"> Or paced the ground—to guide her Husband home, </l>
            <l n="5.771"> By that unwearied signal, kenned afar; </l>
            <l n="5.772"> An anxious duty! which the lofty site, </l>
            <l n="5.773"> Traversed but by a few irregular paths, </l>
            <l n="5.774"> Imposes, whensoe'er untoward chance </l>
            <l n="5.775"> Detains him after his accustomed hour </l>
            <l n="5.776"> Till night lies black upon the ground. 'But come, </l>
            <l n="5.777"> Come,' said the Matron, 'to our poor abode; </l>
            <l n="5.778"> Those dark rocks hide it!' Entering, I beheld </l>
            <l n="5.779"> A blazing fire—beside a cleanly hearth </l>
            <l n="5.780"> Sate down; and to her office, with leave asked, </l>
            <l n="5.781"> The Dame returned. </l>
            <l n="5.782">                     Or ere that glowing pile </l>
            <l n="5.783"> Of mountain turf required the builder's hand </l>
            <l n="5.784"> Its wasted splendour to repair, the door </l>
            <l n="5.785"> Opened, and she re-entered with glad looks, </l>
            <l n="5.786"> Her Helpmate following. Hospitable fare, </l>
            <l n="5.787"> Frank conversation, made the evening's treat: </l>
            <l n="5.788"> Need a bewildered traveller wish for more? </l>
            <l n="5.789"> But more was given; I studied as we sate </l>
            <l n="5.790"> By the bright fire, the good Man's form, and face </l>
            <l n="5.791"> Not less than beautiful; an open brow </l>

            <l n="5.877"> Scattered about under the mouldering walls </l>
            <l n="5.878"> Of a rough precipice; and some, apart, </l>
            <l n="5.879"> In quarters unobnoxious to such chance, </l>
            <l n="5.880"> As if the moon had showered them down in spite. </l>
            <l n="5.881"> But he repined not. Though the plough was scared </l>
            <l n="5.882"> By these obstructions, 'round the shady stones </l>

            <l n="5.898"> No parent was—feelingly could have told, </l>
            <l n="5.899"> In life, in death, what solitude can breed </l>
            <l n="5.900"> Of selfishness, and cruelty, and vice; </l>
            <l n="5.901"> Or, if it breed not, hath not power to cure. </l>
            <l n="5.902"> —But your compliance, Sir! with our request </l>

            <l n="5.912"> He paused—and having lifted up his eyes </l>
            <l n="5.913"> To the pure heaven, he cast them down again </l>
            <l n="5.914"> Upon the earth beneath his feet; and spake:— </l>

            <l n="5.930"> Whether their course be turbulent or smooth, </l>
            <l n="5.931"> Their waters clear or sullied, all are lost </l>
            <l n="5.932"> Within the bosom of yon crystal Lake, </l>

            <l n="5.942"> A dismal prospect yields the wild shore strewn </l>
            <l n="5.943"> With wrecks, and trod by feet of young and old </l>
            <l n="5.944"> Wandering about in miserable search </l>
            <l n="5.945"> Of friends or kindred, whom the angry sea </l>

ESSAY UPON EPITAPHS 
IT needs scarcely be said, that an Epitaph presupposes a Monument, 
upon which it is to be engraven. Almost all Nations have wished 
that certain external signs should point out the places where 
their dead are interred. Among savage tribes unacquainted with 
letters this has mostly been done either by rude stones placed 
near the graves, or by mounds of earth raised over them. This 
custom proceeded obviously from a twofold desire: first to guard 
the remains of the deceased from irreverent approach or from 
savage violation: and secondly to preserve their memory. “Never 
any,” says Camden, “neglected burial but some savage nations; as 
the Bactrians, which cast their dead to the dogs; some varlet 
philosophers, as Diogenes, who desired to be devoured of fishes; 
some dissolute courtiers, as Maecenas, who was wont to say, Non 
tumulum curo; sepelit natura relictos. 
'I'm careless of a grave:—Nature her dead will save.'” 
As soon as nations had learned the use of letters, epitaphs were 
inscribed upon these monuments; in order that their intention 
might be more surely and adequately fulfilled. I have derived 
monuments and epitaphs from two sources of feeling, but these do 
in fact resolve themselves into one. The invention of epitaphs, 
Weever, in his Discourse of Funeral Monuments, says rightly, 
“proceeded from the presage or fore-feeling of immortality, 
implanted in all men naturally, and is referred to the scholars of 
Linus the Theban poet, who flourished about the year of the world 
two thousand seven hundred; who first bewailed this Linus their 
Master, when he was slain, in doleful verses, then called of him 
Oelina, afterwards Epitaphia, for that they were first sung at 
burials, after engraved upon the sepulchres.” 
And, verily, without the consciousness of a principle of 
immortality in the human soul, Man could never have had awakened 
in him the desire to live in the remembrance of his fellows: mere 
love, or the yearning of kind towards kind, could not have 
produced it. The dog or horse perishes in the field, or in the 
stall, by the side of his companions, and is incapable of 
anticipating the sorrow with which his surrounding associates 
shall bemoan his death, or pine for his loss; he cannot pre- 
conceive this regret, he can form no thought of it; and therefore 
cannot possibly have a desire to leave such regret or remembrance 
behind him. Add to the principle of love which exists in the 
inferior animals, the faculty of reason which exists in Man alone; 
will the conjunction of these account for the desire? Doubtless it 
is a necessary consequence of this conjunction; yet not, I think, 
as a direct result, but only to be come at through an intermediate 
thought, viz. that of an intimation or assurance within us, that 
some part of our nature is imperishable. At least the precedence, 
in order of birth, of one feeling to the other, is unquestionable. 
If we look back upon the days of childhood, we shall find that the 
time is not in remembrance when, with respect to our own 
individual Being, the mind was without this assurance; whereas, 
the wish to be remembered by our friends or kindred after death, 
or even in absence, is, as we shall discover, a sensation that 
does not form itself till the 'social' feelings have been 
developed, and the Reason has connected itself with a wide range 
of objects. Forlorn, and cut off from communication with the best 
part of his nature, must that man be, who should derive the sense 
of immortality, as it exists in the mind of a child, from the same 
unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal spirits with which the 
lamb in the meadow or any other irrational creature is endowed; 
who should ascribe it, in short, to blank ignorance in the child; 
to an inability arising from the imperfect state of his faculties 
to come, in any point of his being, into contact with a notion of 
death; or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what has been 
instilled into him! Has such an unfolder of the mysteries of 
nature, though he may have forgotten his former self, ever noticed 
the early, obstinate, and unappeasable inquisitiveness of children 
upon the subject of origination? This single fact proves outwardly 
the monstrousness of those suppositions: for, if we had no direct 
external testimony that the minds of very young children meditate 
feelingly upon death and immortality, these inquiries, which we 
all know they are perpetually making concerning the 'whence', do 
necessarily include correspondent habits of interrogation 
concerning the 'whither'. Origin and tendency are notions 
inseparably co-relative. Never did a child stand by the side of a 
running stream, pondering within himself what power was the feeder 
of the perpetual current, from what never-wearied sources the body 
of water was supplied, but he must have been inevitably propelled 
to follow this question by another: “Towards what abyss is it in 
progress? what receptacle can contain the mighty influx?” And the 
spirit of the answer must have been, though the word might be sea 
or ocean, accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map, 
or from the real object in nature—these might have been the 
'letter', but the 'spirit' of the answer must have been 'as' 
inevitably,—a receptacle without bounds or dimensions;—nothing 
less than infinity. We may, then, be justified in asserting, that 
the sense of immortality, if not a co-existent and twin birth with 
Reason, is among the earliest of her offspring: and we may further 
assert, that from these conjoined, and under their countenance, 
the human affections are gradually formed and opened out. This is 
not the place to enter into the recesses of these investigations; 
but the subject requires me here to make a plain avowal, that, for 
my own part, it is to me inconceivable, that the sympathies of 
love towards each other, which grow with our growth, could ever 
attain any new strength, or even preserve the old, after we had 
received from the outward senses the impression of death, and were 
in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its 
accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves, and to those we 
love; if the same were not counteracted by those communications 
with our internal Being, which are anterior to all these 
experiences, and with which revelation coincides, and has through 
that coincidence alone (for otherwise it could not possess it) a 
power to affect us. I confess, with me the conviction is absolute 
that, if the impression and sense of death were not thus 
counterbalanced, such a hollowness would pervade the whole system 
of things, such a want of correspondence and consistency, a 
disproportion so astounding betwixt means and ends, that there 
could be no repose, no joy. Were we to grow up unfostered by this 
genial warmth, a frost would chill the spirit, so penetrating and 
powerful that there could be no motions of the life of love; and 
infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered after we 
had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about 
like a shadow.—If, then, in a creature endowed with the faculties 
of foresight and reason, the social affections could not have 
unfolded themselves uncountenanced by the faith that Man is an 
immortal being, and if, consequently, neither could the individual 
dying have had a desire to survive in the remembrance of his 
fellows, nor on their side could they have felt a wish to preserve 
for future times vestiges of the departed; it follows, as a final 
inference, that without the belief in immortality, wherein these 
several desires originate, neither monuments nor epitaphs, in 
affectionate or laudatory commemoration of the deceased, could 
have existed in the world. 
Simonides, it is related, upon landing in a strange country, 
found the corse of an unknown person lying by the seaside; he 
buried it, and was honoured throughout Greece for the piety of 
that act. Another ancient Philosopher, chancing to fix his eyes 
upon a dead body, regarded the same with slight, if not with 
contempt, saying, “See the shell of the flown bird!” But it is not 
to be supposed that the moral and tender-hearted Simonides was 
incapable of the lofty movements of thought to which that other 
Sage gave way at the moment while his soul was intent only upon 
the indestructible being; nor, on the other hand, that he, in 
whose sight a lifeless human body was of no more value than the 
worthless shell from which the living fowl had departed, would 
not, in a different mood of mind, have been affected by those 
earthly considerations which had incited the philosophic Poet to 
the performance of that pious duty. And with regard to this latter 
we may be assured that, if he had been destitute of the capability 
of communing with the more exalted thoughts that appertain to 
human nature, he would have cared no more for the corse of the 
stranger than for the dead body of a seal or porpoise which might 
have been cast up by the waves. We respect the corporeal frame of 
Man, not merely because it is the habitation of a rational, but of 
an immortal Soul. Each of these Sages was in sympathy with the 
best feelings of our nature; feelings which, though they seem 
opposite to each other, have another and a finer connection than 
that of contrast.—It is a connection formed through the subtle 
progress by which, both in the natural and the moral world, 
qualities pass insensibly into their contraries, and things 
revolve upon each other. As, in sailing upon the orb of this 
planet, a voyage towards the regions where the sun sets conducts 
gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold 
it come forth at its rising; and, in like manner, a voyage towards 
the east, the birth-place in our imagination of the morning, leads 
finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs 
from our eyes; so the contemplative Soul, travelling in the 
direction of mortality, advances to the country of everlasting 
life; and, in like manner, may she continue to explore those 
cheerful tracts till she is brought back, for her advantage and 
benefit, to the land of transitory things—of sorrow and of tears. 
On a midway point, therefore, which commands the thoughts and 
feelings of the two Sages whom we have represented in contrast, 
does the Author of that species of composition, the laws of which 
it is our present purpose to explain, take his stand. Accordingly, 
recurring to the twofold desire of guarding the remains of the 
deceased and preserving their memory, it may be said that a 
sepulchral monument is a tribute to a man as a human being; and 
that an epitaph (in the ordinary meaning attached to the word) 
includes this general feeling and something more; and is a record 
to preserve the memory of the dead, as a tribute due to his 
individual worth, for a satisfaction to the sorrowing hearts of 
the survivors, and for the common benefit of the living: which 
record is to be accomplished, not in a general manner, but, where 
it can, in 'close connection with the bodily remains of the 
deceased': and these, it may be added, among the modern nations of 
Europe, are deposited within, or contiguous to, their places of 
worship. In ancient times, as is well known, it was the custom to 
bury the dead beyond the walls of towns and cities; and among the 
Greeks and Romans they were frequently interred by the waysides. 
I could here pause with pleasure, and invite the Reader to 
indulge with me in contemplation of the advantages which must have 
attended such a practice. We might ruminate upon the beauty which 
the monuments, thus placed, must have borrowed from the 
surrounding images of nature—from the trees, the wild flowers, 
from a stream running perhaps within sight or hearing, from the 
beaten road stretching its weary length hard by. Many tender 
similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the 
traveller leaning upon one of the tombs, or reposing in the 
coolness of its shade, whether he had halted from weariness or in 
compliance with the invitation, “Pause, Traveller!” so often found 
upon the monuments. And to its epitaph also must have been 
supplied strong appeals to visible appearances or immediate 
impressions, lively and affecting analogies of life as a journey— 
death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer—of misfortune as a 
storm that falls suddenly upon him—of beauty as a flower that 
passeth away, or of innocent pleasure as one that may be gathered- 
-of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating waves- 
-of hope “undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the 
river that has fed it,” or blasted in a moment like a pine-tree by 
the stroke of lightning upon the mountain-top—of admonitions and 
heart-stirring remembrances, like a refreshing breeze that comes 
without warning, or the taste of the waters of an unexpected 
fountain. These and similar suggestions must have given, formerly, 
to the language of the senseless stone a voice enforced and 
endeared by the benignity of that nature with which it was in 
unison.—We, in modern times, have lost much of these advantages; 
and they are but in a small degree counterbalanced to the 
inhabitants of large towns and cities by the custom of depositing 
the dead within, or contiguous to, their places of worship; 
however splendid or imposing may be the appearance of those 
edifices, or however interesting or salutary the recollections 
associated with them. Even were it not true that tombs lose their 
monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men occupied 
with the cares of the world, and too often sullied and defiled by 
those cares, yet still, when death is in our thoughts, nothing can 
make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature, and 
for the absence of those types of renovation and decay which the 
fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and 
contemplative mind. To feel the force of this sentiment, let a man 
only compare in imagination the unsightly manner in which our 
monuments are crowded together in the busy, noisy, unclean, and 
almost grassless churchyard of a large town, with the still 
seclusion of a Turkish cemetery, in some remote place, and yet 
further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is 
embosomed. Thoughts in the same temper as these have already been 
expressed with true sensibility by an ingenuous Poet of the 
present day. The subject of his poem is “All Saints Church, 
Derby:” he has been deploring the forbidding and unseemly 
appearance of its burial-ground, and uttering a wish that in past 
times the practice had been adopted of interring the inhabitants 
of large towns in the country;— </l>

A village churchyard, lying as it does in the lap of nature, may 
indeed be most favourably contrasted with that of a town of 
crowded population; and sepulture therein combines many of the 
best tendencies which belong to the mode practised by the Ancients 
with others peculiar to itself. The sensations of pious 
cheerfulness, which attend the celebration of the sabbath-day in 
rural places, are profitably chastised by the sight of the graves 
of kindred and friends, gathered together in that general home 
towards which the thoughtful yet happy spectators themselves are 
journeying. Hence a parish church, in the stillness of the 
country, is a visible centre of a community of the living and the 
dead; a point to which are habitually referred the nearest 
concerns of both. 
As, then, both in cities and in villages, the dead are deposited 
in close connection with our places of worship, with us the 
composition of an epitaph naturally turns, still more than among 
the nations of antiquity, upon the most serious and solemn 
affections of the human mind; upon departed worth—upon personal 
or social sorrow and admiration—upon religion, individual and 
social—upon time, and upon eternity. Accordingly, it suffices, in 
ordinary cases, to secure a composition of this kind from censure, 
that it contain nothing that shall shock or be inconsistent with 
this spirit. But, to entitle an epitaph to praise, more than this 
is necessary. It ought to contain some thought or feeling 
belonging to the mortal or immortal part of our nature touchingly 
expressed; and if that be done, however general or even trite the 
sentiment may be, every man of pure mind will read the words with 
pleasure and gratitude. A husband bewails a wife; a parent 
breathes a sigh of disappointed hope over a lost child; a son 
utters a sentiment of filial reverence for a departed father or 
mother; a friend perhaps inscribes an encomium recording the 
companionable qualities, or the solid virtues, of the tenant of 
the grave, whose departure has left a sadness upon his memory. 
This and a pious admonition to the living, and a humble expression 
of Christian confidence in immortality, is the language of a 
thousand churchyards; and it does not often happen that anything, 
in a greater degree discriminate or appropriate to the dead or to 
the living, is to be found in them. This want of discrimination 
has been ascribed by Dr. Johnson, in his Essay upon the epitaphs 
of Pope, to two causes: first, the scantiness of the objects of 
human praise; and, secondly, the want of variety in the characters 
of men; or, to use his own words, “to the fact, that the greater 
part of mankind have no character at all.” Such language may be 
holden without blame among the generalities of common 
conversation; but does not become a critic and a moralist speaking 
seriously upon a serious subject. The objects of admiration in 
human nature are not scanty, but abundant: and every man has a 
character of his own to the eye that has skill to perceive it. The 
real cause of the acknowledged want of discrimination in 
sepulchral memorials is this: That to analyse the characters of 
others, especially of those whom we love, is not a common or 
natural employment of men at any time. We are not anxious 
unerringly to understand the constitution of the minds of those 
who have soothed, who have cheered, who have supported us; with 
whom we have been long and daily pleased or delighted. The 
affections are their own justification. The light of love in our 
hearts is a satisfactory evidence that there is a body of worth in 
the minds of our friends or kindred, whence that light has 
proceeded. We shrink from the thought of placing their merits and 
defects to be weighed against each other in the nice balance of 
pure intellect; nor do we find much temptation to detect the 
shades by which a good quality or virtue is discriminated in them 
from an excellence known by the same general name as it exists in 
the mind of another; and least of all do we incline to these 
refinements when under the pressure of sorrow, admiration, or 
regret, or when actuated by any of those feelings which incite men 
to prolong the memory of their friends and kindred by records 
placed in the bosom of the all-uniting and equalising receptacle 
of the dead. 
The first requisite, then, in an Epitaph is, that it should 
speak, in a tone which shall sink into the heart, the general 
language of humanity as connected with the subject of death—the 
source from which an epitaph proceeds—of death, and of life. To 
be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel 
themselves to be in absolute coincidence. This general language 
may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high 
praise; yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other 
excellences be superadded. Passing through all intermediate steps, 
we will attempt to determine at once what these excellences are, 
and wherein consists the perfection of this species of 
composition.—It will be found to lie in a due proportion of the 
common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a 
distinct and clear conception, conveyed to the reader's mind, of 
the individual whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be 
preserved; at least of his character as, after death, it appeared 
to those who loved him and lament his loss. The general sympathy 
ought to be quickened, provoked, and diversified, by particular 
thoughts, actions, images,—circumstances of age, occupation, 
manner of life, prosperity which the deceased had known, or 
adversity to which he had been subject; and these ought to be 
bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general 
sympathy. The two powers should temper, restrain, and exalt each 
other. The reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he 
is called upon to think of with interest. A distinct conception 
should be given (implicitly where it can, rather than explicitly) 
of the individual lamented.—But the writer of an epitaph is not 
an anatomist, who dissects the internal frame of the mind; he is 
not even a painter, who executes a portrait at leisure and in 
entire tranquillity: his delineation, we must remember, is 
performed by the side of the grave; and, what is more, the grave 
of one whom he loves and admires. What purity and brightness is 
that virtue clothed in, the image of which must no longer bless 
our living eyes! The character of a deceased friend or beloved 
kinsman is not seen—no, nor ought to be seen—otherwise than as a 
tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist, that spiritualises 
and beautifies it; that takes away, indeed, but only to the end 
that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified 
and lovely; may impress and affect the more. Shall we say, then, 
that this is not truth, not a faithful image; and that, 
accordingly, the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered?—It 
'is' truth, and of the highest order; for, though doubtless things 
are not apparent which did exist; yet, the object being looked at 
through this medium, parts and proportions are brought into 
distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or 
unconsciously seen: it is truth hallowed by love—the joint 
offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the 
living! This may easily be brought to the test. Let one, whose 
eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what 
was amiss in the character of a good man, hear the tidings of his 
death, and what a change is wrought in a moment! Enmity melts 
away; and, as it disappears, unsightliness, disproportion, and 
deformity, vanish; and, through the influence of commiseration, a 
harmony of love and beauty succeeds. Bring such a man to the 
tombstone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary, 
composed in the spirit which we have recommended. Would he turn 
from it as from an idle tale? No;—the thoughtful look, the sigh, 
and perhaps the involuntary tear, would testify that it had a 
sane, a generous, and good meaning; and that on the writer's mind 
had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the 
character of the deceased; that his gifts and graces were 
remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered. 
The composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man, 
contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is 
mouldering, ought to appear, and be felt as something midway 
between what he was on earth walking about with his living 
frailties, and what he may be presumed to be as a Spirit in 
heaven. 
It suffices, therefore, that the trunk and the main branches of 
the worth of the deceased be boldly and unaffectedly represented. 
Any further detail, minutely and scrupulously pursued, especially 
if this be done with laborious and antithetic discriminations, 
must inevitably frustrate its own purpose; forcing the passing 
Spectator to this conclusion,—either that the dead did not 
possess the merits ascribed to him, or that they who have raised a 
monument to his memory, and must therefore be supposed to have 
been closely connected with him, were incapable of perceiving 
those merits; or at least during the act of composition had lost 
sight of them; for, the understanding having been so busy in its 
petty occupation, how could the heart of the mourner be other than 
cold? and in either of these cases, whether the fault be on the 
part of the buried person or the survivors, the memorial is 
unaffecting and profitless. 
Much better is it to fall short in discrimination than to pursue 
it too far, or to labour it unfeelingly. For in no place are we so 
much disposed to dwell upon those points of nature and condition 
wherein all men resemble each other, as in the temple where the 
universal Father is worshipped, or by the side of the grave which 
gathers all human Beings to itself, and “equalises the lofty and 
the low.” We suffer and we weep with the same heart; we love and 
are anxious for one another in one spirit; our hopes look to the 
same quarter; and the virtues by which we are all to be furthered 
and supported, as patience, meekness, good-will, justice, 
temperance, and temperate desires, are in an equal degree the 
concern of us all. Let an Epitaph, then, contain at least these 
acknowledgments to our common nature; nor let the sense of their 
importance be sacrificed to a balance of opposite qualities or 
minute distinctions in individual character; which if they do not 
(as will for the most part be the case), when examined, resolve 
themselves into a trick of words, will, even when they are true 
and just, for the most part be grievously out of place; for, as it 
is probable that few only have explored these intricacies of human 
nature, so can the tracing of them be interesting only to a few. 
But an epitaph is not a proud writing shut up for the studious: it 
is exposed to all—to the wise and the most ignorant; it is 
condescending, perspicuous, and lovingly solicits regard; its 
story and admonitions are brief, that the thoughtless, the busy, 
and indolent, may not be deterred, nor the impatient tired: the 
stooping old man cons the engraven record like a second horn- 
book;—the child is proud that he can read it;—and the stranger 
is introduced through its mediation to the company of a friend: it 
is concerning all, and for all:—in the churchyard it is open to 
the day; the sun looks down upon the stone, and the rains of 
heaven beat against it. 
Yet, though the writer who would excite sympathy is bound in 
this case, more than in any other, to give proof that he himself 
has been moved, it is to be remembered that to raise a monument is 
a sober and a reflective act; that the inscription which it bears 
is intended to be permanent, and for universal perusal; and that, 
for this reason, the thoughts and feelings expressed should be 
permanent also—liberated from that weakness and anguish of sorrow 
which is in nature transitory, and which with instinctive decency 
retires from notice. The passions should be subdued, the emotions 
controlled; strong, indeed, but nothing ungovernable or wholly 
involuntary. Seemliness requires this, and truth requires it also: 
for how can the narrator otherwise be trusted? Moreover, a grave 
is a tranquillising object: resignation in course of time springs 
up from it as naturally as the wild flowers, besprinkling the turf 
with which it may be covered, or gathering round the monument by 
which it is defended. The very form and substance of the monument 
which has received the inscription, and the appearance of the 
letters, testifying with what a slow and laborious hand they must 
have been engraven, might seem to reproach the author who had 
given way upon this occasion to transports of mind, or to quick 
turns of conflicting passion; though the same might constitute the 
life and beauty of a funeral oration or elegiac poem. 
These sensations and judgments, acted upon perhaps 
unconsciously, have been one of the main causes why epitaphs so 
often personate the deceased, and represent him as speaking from 
his own tomb-stone. The departed Mortal is introduced telling you 
himself that his pains are gone; that a state of rest is come; and 
he conjures you to weep for him no longer. He admonishes with the 
voice of one experienced in the vanity of those affections which 
are confined to earthly objects, and gives a verdict like a 
superior Being, performing the office of a judge, who has no 
temptations to mislead him, and whose decision cannot but be 
dispassionate. Thus is death disarmed of its sting, and affliction 
unsubstantialised. By this tender fiction, the survivors bind 
themselves to a sedater sorrow, and employ the intervention of the 
imagination in order that the reason may speak her own language 
earlier than she would otherwise have been enabled to do. This 
shadowy interposition also harmoniously unites the two worlds of 
the living and the dead by their appropriate affections. And it 
may be observed that here we have an additional proof of the 
propriety with which sepulchral inscriptions were referred to the 
consciousness of immortality as their primal source. 
I do not speak with a wish to recommend that an epitaph should 
be cast in this mould preferably to the still more common one, in 
which what is said comes from the survivors directly; but rather 
to point out how natural those feelings are which have induced 
men, in all states and ranks of society, so frequently to adopt 
this mode. And this I have done chiefly in order that the laws 
which ought to govern the composition of the other may be better 
understood. This latter mode, namely, that in which the survivors 
speak in their own persons, seems to me upon the whole greatly 
preferable, as it admits a wider range of notices; and, above all, 
because, excluding the fiction which is the groundwork of the 
other, it rests upon a more solid basis. 
Enough has been said to convey our notion of a perfect epitaph; 
but it must be borne in mind that one is meant which will best 
answer the 'general' ends of that species of composition. 
According to the course pointed out, the worth of private life, 
through all varieties of situation and character, will be most 
honourably and profitably preserved in memory. Nor would the model 
recommended less suit public men in all instances, save of those 
persons who by the greatness of their services in the employments 
of peace or war, or by the surpassing excellence of their works in 
art, literature, or science, have made themselves not only 
universally known, but have filled the heart of their country with 
everlasting gratitude. Yet I must here pause to correct myself. In 
describing the general tenor of thought which epitaphs ought to 
hold, I have omitted to say, that if it be the 'actions' of a man, 
or even some 'one' conspicuous or beneficial act of local or 
general utility, which have distinguished him, and excited a 
desire that he should be remembered, then, of course, ought the 
attention to be directed chiefly to those actions or that act: and 
such sentiments dwelt upon as naturally arise out of them or it. 
Having made this necessary distinction, I proceed.—The mighty 
benefactors of mankind, as they are not only known by the 
immediate survivors, but will continue to be known familiarly to 
latest posterity, do not stand in need of biographic sketches in 
such a place; nor of delineations of character to individualise 
them. This is already done by their Works, in the memories of men. 
Their naked names, and a grand comprehensive sentiment of civic 
gratitude, patriotic love, or human admiration—or the utterance 
of some elementary principle most essential in the constitution of 
true virtue—or a declaration touching that pious humility and 
self-abasement, which are ever most profound as minds are most 
susceptible of genuine exaltation—or an intuition, communicated 
in adequate words, of the sublimity of intellectual power;—these 
are the only tribute which can here be paid—the only offering 
that upon such an altar would not be unworthy. </l>

            <head>ARGUMENT</head>
            <p>Poet's Address to the State and Church of England—The Pastor 
not inferior to the ancient Worthies of the Church—He begins his 
Narratives with an instance of unrequited Love—Anguish of mind 
subdued, and how—The lonely Miner—An instance of perseverance— 
Which leads by contrast to an example of abused talents, 
irresolution, and weakness—Solitary, applying this covertly to 
his own case, asks for an instance of some Stranger, whose 
dispositions may have led him to end his days here—Pastor, in 
answer, gives an account of the harmonising influence of Solitude 
upon two men of opposite principles, who had encountered 
agitations in public life—The rule by which Peace may be obtained 
expressed, and where—Solitary hints at an overpowering Fatality— 
Answer of the Pastor—What subjects he will exclude from his 
Narratives—Conversation upon this—Instance of an unamiable 
character, a Female, and why given—Contrasted with this, a meek 
sufferer, from unguarded and betrayed love—Instance of heavier 
guilt, and its consequences to the Offender—With this instance of 
a Marriage Contract broken is contrasted one of a Widower, 
evidencing his faithful affection towards his deceased wife by his 
care of their female Children.

            <l n="6.297"> Was graceful, when it pleased him, smooth and still </l>
            <l n="6.298"> As the mute swan that floats adown the stream, </l>

            <l n="6.302"> And not a flower, that droops in the green shade, </l>
            <l n="6.303"> More winningly reserved! If ye enquire </l>
            <l n="6.304"> How such consummate elegance was bred </l>
            <l n="6.305"> Amid these wilds, this answer may suffice; </l>

            <l n="6.314"> And skill in letters—every fancy shaped </l>
            <l n="6.315"> Fair expectations; nor, when to the world's </l>
            <l n="6.316"> Capacious field forth went the Adventurer, there </l>
            <l n="6.317"> Were he and his attainments overlooked, </l>
            <l n="6.318"> Or scantily rewarded; but all hopes, </l>
            <l n="6.319"> Cherished for him, he suffered to depart, </l>

            <l n="6.322"> That sparkling decked the morning grass; or aught </l>
            <l n="6.323"> That 'was' attractive, and hath ceased to be! </l>
            <l n="6.324">   Yet, when this Prodigal returned, the rites </l>
            <l n="6.325"> Of joyful greeting were on him bestowed, </l>
            <l n="6.326"> Who, by humiliation undeterred, </l>
            <l n="6.327"> Sought for his weariness a place of rest </l>
            <l n="6.328"> Within his Father's gates.—Whence came he?—clothed </l>
            <l n="6.329"> In tattered garb, from hovels where abides </l>
            <l n="6.330"> Necessity, the stationary host </l>
            <l n="6.331"> Of vagrant poverty; from rifted barns </l>
            <l n="6.332"> Where no one dwells but the wide-staring owl </l>
            <l n="6.333"> And the owl's prey; from these bare haunts, to which </l>
            <l n="6.334"> He had descended from the proud saloon, </l>
            <l n="6.335"> He came, the ghost of beauty and of health, </l>
            <l n="6.336"> The wreck of gaiety! But soon revived </l>
            <l n="6.337"> In strength, in power refitted, he renewed </l>
            <l n="6.338"> His suit to Fortune; and she smiled again </l>
            <l n="6.339"> Upon a fickle Ingrate. Thrice he rose, </l>
            <l n="6.340"> Thrice sank as willingly. For he—whose nerves </l>
            <l n="6.341"> Were used to thrill with pleasure, while his voice </l>
            <l n="6.342"> Softly accompanied the tuneful harp, </l>
            <l n="6.343"> By the nice finger of fair ladies touched </l>
            <l n="6.344"> In glittering halls—was able to derive </l>
            <l n="6.345"> No less enjoyment from an abject choice. </l>
            <l n="6.346"> Who happier for the moment—who more blithe </l>
            <l n="6.347"> Than this fallen Spirit? in those dreary holds </l>
            <l n="6.348"> His talents lending to exalt the freaks </l>
            <l n="6.349"> Of merry-making beggars,—nor provoked </l>
            <l n="6.350"> To laughter multiplied in louder peals </l>
            <l n="6.351"> By his malicious wit; then, all enchained </l>
            <l n="6.352"> With mute astonishment, themselves to see </l>
            <l n="6.353"> In their own arts outdone, their fame eclipsed, </l>
            <l n="6.354"> As by the very presence of the Fiend </l>
            <l n="6.355"> Who dictates and inspires illusive feats, </l>
            <l n="6.356"> For knavish purposes! The city, too, </l>
            <l n="6.357"> (With shame I speak it) to her guilty bowers </l>
            <l n="6.358"> Allured him, sunk so low in self-respect </l>
            <l n="6.359"> As there to linger, there to eat his bread, </l>
            <l n="6.360"> Hired minstrel of voluptuous blandishment; </l>
            <l n="6.361"> Charming the air with skill of hand or voice, </l>
            <l n="6.362"> Listen who would, be wrought upon who might, </l>
            <l n="6.363"> Sincerely wretched hearts, or falsely gay. </l>
            <l n="6.364"> —Such the too frequent tenor of his boast </l>
            <l n="6.365"> In ears that relished the report;—but all </l>
            <l n="6.366"> Was from his Parents happily concealed; </l>
            <l n="6.367"> Who saw enough for blame and pitying love. </l>
            <l n="6.368"> They also were permitted to receive </l>
            <l n="6.369"> His last, repentant breath; and closed his eyes, </l>
            <l n="6.370"> No more to open on that irksome world </l>
            <l n="6.371"> Where he had long existed in the state </l>
            <l n="6.372"> Of a young fowl beneath one mother hatched, </l>
            <l n="6.373"> Though from another sprung, different in kind: </l>
            <l n="6.374"> Where he had lived, and could not cease to live, </l>
            <l n="6.375"> Distracted in propensity; content </l>
            <l n="6.376"> With neither element of good or ill; </l>
            <l n="6.377"> And yet in both rejoicing; man unblest; </l>
            <l n="6.378"> Of contradictions infinite the slave, </l>
            <l n="6.379"> Till his deliverance, when Mercy made him </l>
            <l n="6.380"> One with himself, and one with them that sleep.” </l>
            <l n="6.381">   “'Tis strange,” observed the Solitary, “strange </l>
            <l n="6.382"> It seems, and scarcely less than pitiful, </l>

            <l n="6.384"> For all that can no longer feed themselves, </l>
            <l n="6.385"> A man like this should choose to bring his shame </l>

            <l n="6.387"> Infect the air which he had freely breathed </l>
            <l n="6.388"> In happy infancy. He could not pine, </l>
            <l n="6.389"> Through lack of converse; no—he must have found </l>
            <l n="6.390"> Abundant exercise for thought and speech, </l>
            <l n="6.391"> In his dividual being, self-reviewed, </l>
            <l n="6.392"> Self-catechised, self-punished.—Some there are </l>
            <l n="6.393"> Who, drawing near their final home, and much </l>
            <l n="6.394"> And daily longing that the same were reached, </l>
            <l n="6.395"> Would rather shun than seek the fellowship </l>

            <l n="6.407"> Could I discourse; but as their stay was brief, </l>
            <l n="6.408"> So their departure only left behind </l>
            <l n="6.409"> Fancies, and loose conjectures. Other trace </l>
            <l n="6.410"> Survives, for worthy mention, of a pair </l>

            <l n="6.414"> Of this far-winding vale, remained as friends </l>
            <l n="6.415"> True to their choice; and gave their bones in trust </l>
            <l n="6.416"> To this loved cemetery, here to lodge </l>
            <l n="6.417"> With unescutcheoned privacy interred </l>
            <l n="6.418"> Far from the family vault.—A Chieftain one </l>
            <l n="6.419"> By right of birth; within whose spotless breast </l>
            <l n="6.420"> The fire of ancient Caledonia burned: </l>
            <l n="6.421"> He, with the foremost whose impatience hailed </l>
            <l n="6.422"> The Stuart, landing to resume, by force </l>
            <l n="6.423"> Of arms, the crown which bigotry had lost, </l>
            <l n="6.424"> Aroused his clan; and, fighting at their head, </l>
            <l n="6.425"> With his brave sword endeavoured to prevent </l>
            <l n="6.426"> Culloden's fatal overthrow. Escaped </l>
            <l n="6.427"> From that disastrous rout, to foreign shores </l>
            <l n="6.428"> He fled; and when the lenient hand of time </l>
            <l n="6.429"> Those troubles had appeased, he sought and gained, </l>
            <l n="6.430"> For his obscured condition, an obscure </l>

            <l n="6.433"> Had fixed his milder loyalty, and placed </l>
            <l n="6.434"> His gentler sentiments of love and hate, </l>
            <l n="6.435"> There, where 'they' placed them who in conscience prized </l>
            <l n="6.436"> The new succession, as a line of kings </l>
            <l n="6.437"> Whose oath had virtue to protect the land </l>
            <l n="6.438"> Against the dire assaults of papacy </l>
            <l n="6.439"> And arbitrary rule. But launch thy bark </l>

            <l n="6.442"> If, spite of keenest eye and steadiest hand, </l>
            <l n="6.443"> The stream, that bears thee forward, prove not, soon </l>
            <l n="6.444"> Or late, a perilous master. He—who oft, </l>

            <l n="6.446"> That round his mansion cast a sober gloom, </l>
            <l n="6.447"> Had moralised on this, and other truths </l>
            <l n="6.448"> Of kindred import, pleased and satisfied— </l>
            <l n="6.449"> Was forced to vent his wisdom with a sigh </l>
            <l n="6.450"> Heaved from the heart in fortune's bitterness, </l>
            <l n="6.451"> When he had crushed a plentiful estate </l>
            <l n="6.452"> By ruinous contest, to obtain a seat </l>
            <l n="6.453"> In Britain's senate. Fruitless was the attempt; </l>
            <l n="6.454"> And while the uproar of that desperate strife </l>
            <l n="6.455"> Continued yet to vibrate on his ear, </l>

            <l n="6.459"> That he was glad to lose) slunk from the world </l>
            <l n="6.460"> To the deep shade of those untravelled Wilds; </l>
            <l n="6.461"> In which the Scottish Laird had long possessed </l>
            <l n="6.462"> An undisturbed abode. Here, then, they met, </l>
            <l n="6.463"> Two doughty champions; flaming Jacobite </l>
            <l n="6.464"> And sullen Hanoverian! You might think </l>
            <l n="6.465"> That losses and vexations, less severe </l>
            <l n="6.466"> Than those which they had severally sustained, </l>
            <l n="6.467"> Would have inclined each to abate his zeal </l>
            <l n="6.468"> For his ungrateful cause; no,—I have heard </l>
            <l n="6.469"> My reverend Father tell that, 'mid the calm </l>
            <l n="6.470"> Of that small town encountering thus, they filled, </l>
            <l n="6.471"> Daily, its bowling-green with harmless strife; </l>
            <l n="6.472"> Plagued with uncharitable thoughts the church; </l>
            <l n="6.473"> And vexed the market-place. But in the breasts </l>
            <l n="6.474"> Of these opponents gradually was wrought, </l>
            <l n="6.475"> With little change of general sentiment, </l>
            <l n="6.476"> Such leaning towards each other, that their days </l>
            <l n="6.477"> By choice were spent in constant fellowship; </l>
            <l n="6.478"> And if, at times, they fretted with the yoke, </l>
            <l n="6.479"> Those very bickerings made them love it more. </l>
            <l n="6.480">   A favourite boundary to their lengthened walks </l>
            <l n="6.481"> This Churchyard was. And, whether they had come </l>
            <l n="6.482"> Treading their path in sympathy and linked </l>
            <l n="6.483"> In social converse, or by some short space </l>
            <l n="6.484"> Discreetly parted to preserve the peace, </l>
            <l n="6.485"> One spirit seldom failed to extend its sway </l>
            <l n="6.486"> Over both minds, when they awhile had marked </l>
            <l n="6.487"> The visible quiet of this holy ground, </l>
            <l n="6.488"> And breathed its soothing air:—the spirit of hope </l>
            <l n="6.489"> And saintly magnanimity; that—spurning </l>
            <l n="6.490"> The field of selfish difference and dispute, </l>
            <l n="6.491"> And every care which transitory things, </l>
            <l n="6.492"> Earth and the kingdoms of the earth, create— </l>
            <l n="6.493"> Doth, by a rapture of forgetfulness, </l>
            <l n="6.494"> Preclude forgiveness, from the praise debarred, </l>
            <l n="6.495"> Which else the Christian virtue might have claimed. </l>
            <l n="6.496">   There live who yet remember here to have seen </l>
            <l n="6.497"> Their courtly figures, seated on the stump </l>
            <l n="6.498"> Of an old yew, their favourite resting-place. </l>
            <l n="6.499"> But as the remnant of the long-lived tree </l>
            <l n="6.500"> Was disappearing by a swift decay, </l>
            <l n="6.501"> They, with joint care, determined to erect, </l>
            <l n="6.502"> Upon its site, a dial, that might stand </l>
            <l n="6.503"> For public use preserved, and thus survive </l>
            <l n="6.504"> As their own private monument: for this </l>
            <l n="6.505"> Was the particular spot, in which they wished </l>
            <l n="6.506"> (And Heaven was pleased to accomplish the desire) </l>
            <l n="6.507"> That, undivided, their remains should lie. </l>
            <l n="6.508"> So, where the mouldered tree had stood, was raised </l>
            <l n="6.509"> Yon structure, framing, with the ascent of steps </l>
            <l n="6.510"> That to the decorated pillar lead, </l>
            <l n="6.511"> A work of art more sumptuous than might seem </l>
            <l n="6.512"> To suit this place; yet built in no proud scorn </l>
            <l n="6.513"> Of rustic homeliness; they only aimed </l>
            <l n="6.514"> To ensure for it respectful guardianship. </l>
            <l n="6.515"> Around the margin of the plate, whereon </l>
            <l n="6.516"> The shadow falls to note the stealthy hours, </l>
            <l n="6.517"> Winds an inscriptive legend.”—At these words </l>
            <l n="6.518"> Thither we turned; and gathered, as we read, </l>
            <l n="6.519"> The appropriate sense, in Latin numbers couched: </l>
            <l n="6.520"> 'Time flies; it is his melancholy task, </l>
            <l n="6.521"> To bring, and bear away, delusive hopes, </l>
            <l n="6.522"> And re-produce the troubles he destroys. </l>
            <l n="6.523"> But, while his blindness thus is occupied, </l>
            <l n="6.524"> Discerning Mortal! do thou serve the will </l>
            <l n="6.525"> Of Time's eternal Master, and that peace, </l>
            <l n="6.526"> Which the world wants, shall be for thee confirmed!' </l>
            <l n="6.527">   “Smooth verse, inspired by no unlettered Muse,” </l>
            <l n="6.528"> Exclaimed the Sceptic, “and the strain of thought </l>

            <l n="6.530"> Of yon white torrent falling down the rocks </l>
            <l n="6.531"> Speaks, less distinctly, to the same effect. </l>
            <l n="6.532"> If, then, their blended influence be not lost </l>
            <l n="6.533"> Upon our hearts, not wholly lost, I grant, </l>
            <l n="6.534"> Even upon mine, the more are we required </l>
            <l n="6.535"> To feel for those among our fellow-men, </l>
            <l n="6.536"> Who, offering no obeisance to the world, </l>

            <l n="6.540"> Their life's appointed prison; not more free </l>
            <l n="6.541"> Than sentinels, between two armies, set, </l>
            <l n="6.542"> With nothing better, in the chill night air, </l>
            <l n="6.543"> Than their own thoughts to comfort them. Say why </l>
            <l n="6.544"> That ancient story of Prometheus chained </l>
            <l n="6.545"> To the bare rock on frozen Caucasus; </l>
            <l n="6.546"> The vulture, the inexhaustible repast </l>
            <l n="6.547"> Drawn from his vitals? Say what meant the woes </l>
            <l n="6.548"> By Tantalus entailed upon his race, </l>
            <l n="6.549"> And the dark sorrows of the line of Thebes? </l>
            <l n="6.550"> Fictions in form, but in their substance truths, </l>
            <l n="6.551"> Tremendous truths! familiar to the men </l>
            <l n="6.552"> Of long-past times, nor obsolete in ours. </l>
            <l n="6.553"> Exchange the shepherd's frock of native grey </l>
            <l n="6.554"> For robes with regal purple tinged; convert </l>
            <l n="6.555"> The crook into a sceptre; give the pomp </l>

            <l n="6.617"> The lingering gleam of their departed lives </l>
            <l n="6.618"> To oral record, and the silent heart; </l>
            <l n="6.619"> Depositories faithful and more kind </l>
            <l n="6.620"> Than fondest epitaph: for, if those fail, </l>
            <l n="6.621"> What boots the sculptured tomb? And who can blame, </l>
            <l n="6.622"> Who rather would not envy, men that feel </l>
            <l n="6.623"> This mutual confidence; if, from such source, </l>

            <l n="6.626"> Nor should I much condemn it, if it spring </l>
            <l n="6.627"> From disregard of time's destructive power, </l>
            <l n="6.628"> As only capable to prey on things </l>
            <l n="6.629"> Of earth, and human nature's mortal part. </l>
            <l n="6.630">   Yet—in less simple districts, where we see </l>
            <l n="6.631"> Stone lift its forehead emulous of stone </l>
            <l n="6.632"> In courting notice; and the ground all paved </l>
            <l n="6.633"> With commendations of departed worth; </l>
            <l n="6.634"> Reading, where'er we turn, of innocent lives, </l>
            <l n="6.635"> Of each domestic charity fulfilled, </l>
            <l n="6.636"> And sufferings meekly borne—I, for my part, </l>

            <l n="6.642"> With such memorials, I have sometimes felt, </l>
            <l n="6.643"> It was no momentary happiness </l>
            <l n="6.644"> To have 'one' Enclosure where the voice that speaks </l>
            <l n="6.645"> In envy or detraction is not heard; </l>
            <l n="6.646"> Which malice may not enter; where the traces </l>
            <l n="6.647"> Of evil inclinations are unknown; </l>
            <l n="6.648"> Where love and pity tenderly unite </l>
            <l n="6.649"> With resignation; and no jarring tone </l>
            <l n="6.650"> Intrudes, the peaceful concert to disturb </l>

            <l n="6.653"> The Pastor said, “I willingly confine </l>
            <l n="6.654"> My narratives to subjects that excite </l>
            <l n="6.655"> Feelings with these accordant; love, esteem, </l>

            <l n="6.668">                              And yet there are, </l>
            <l n="6.669"> I feel, good reasons why we should not leave </l>
            <l n="6.670"> Wholly untraced a more forbidding way. </l>
            <l n="6.671"> For, strength to persevere and to support, </l>
            <l n="6.672"> And energy to conquer and repel— </l>
            <l n="6.673"> These elements of virtue, that declare </l>
            <l n="6.674"> The native grandeur of the human soul— </l>
            <l n="6.675"> Are oft-times not unprofitably shown </l>
            <l n="6.676"> In the perverseness of a selfish course: </l>
            <l n="6.677"> Truth every day exemplified, no less </l>
            <l n="6.678"> In the grey cottage by the murmuring stream </l>
            <l n="6.679"> Than in fantastic conqueror's roving camp, </l>
            <l n="6.680"> Or 'mid the factious senate, unappalled </l>
            <l n="6.681"> Whoe'er may sink, or rise—to sink again, </l>
            <l n="6.682"> As merciless proscription ebbs and flows. </l>
            <l n="6.683">   There,” said the Vicar, pointing as he spake, </l>
            <l n="6.684"> “A woman rests in peace; surpassed by few </l>
            <l n="6.685"> In power of mind, and eloquent discourse. </l>
            <l n="6.686"> Tall was her stature; her complexion dark </l>
            <l n="6.687"> And saturnine; her head not raised to hold </l>
            <l n="6.688"> Converse with heaven, nor yet deprest towards earth, </l>
            <l n="6.689"> But in projection carried, as she walked </l>
            <l n="6.690"> For ever musing. Sunken were her eyes; </l>
            <l n="6.691"> Wrinkled and furrowed with habitual thought </l>
            <l n="6.692"> Was her broad forehead; like the brow of one </l>
            <l n="6.693"> Whose visual nerve shrinks from a painful glare </l>
            <l n="6.694"> Of overpowering light.—While yet a child, </l>
            <l n="6.695"> She, 'mid the humble flowerets of the vale, </l>
            <l n="6.696"> Towered like the imperial thistle, not unfurnished </l>
            <l n="6.697"> With its appropriate grace, yet rather seeking </l>
            <l n="6.698"> To be admired, than coveted and loved. </l>
            <l n="6.699"> Even at that age she ruled, a sovereign queen, </l>
            <l n="6.700"> Over her comrades; else their simple sports, </l>
            <l n="6.701"> Wanting all relish for her strenuous mind, </l>
            <l n="6.702"> Had crossed her only to be shunned with scorn, </l>
            <l n="6.703"> —Oh! pang of sorrowful regret for those </l>
            <l n="6.704"> Whom, in their youth, sweet study has enthralled, </l>
            <l n="6.705"> That they have lived for harsher servitude, </l>
            <l n="6.706"> Whether in soul, in body, or estate! </l>
            <l n="6.707"> Such doom was hers; yet nothing could subdue </l>
            <l n="6.708"> Her keen desire of knowledge, nor efface </l>
            <l n="6.709"> Those brighter images by books imprest </l>
            <l n="6.710"> Upon her memory, faithfully as stars </l>
            <l n="6.711"> That occupy their places, and, though oft </l>
            <l n="6.712"> Hidden by clouds, and oft bedimmed by haze, </l>
            <l n="6.713"> Are not to be extinguished, nor impaired. </l>
            <l n="6.714">   Two passions, both degenerate, for they both </l>
            <l n="6.715"> Began in honour, gradually obtained </l>
            <l n="6.716"> Rule over her, and vexed her daily life; </l>
            <l n="6.717"> An unremitting, avaricious thrift; </l>
            <l n="6.718"> And a strange thraldom of maternal love, </l>
            <l n="6.719"> That held her spirit, in its own despite, </l>
            <l n="6.720"> Bound—by vexation, and regret, and scorn, </l>
            <l n="6.721"> Constrained forgiveness, and relenting vows, </l>
            <l n="6.722"> And tears, in pride suppressed, in shame concealed— </l>
            <l n="6.723"> To a poor dissolute Son, her only child. </l>
            <l n="6.724"> —Her wedded days had opened with mishap, </l>
            <l n="6.725"> Whence dire dependence. What could she perform </l>
            <l n="6.726"> To shake the burthen off? Ah! there was felt, </l>
            <l n="6.727"> Indignantly, the weakness of her sex. </l>
            <l n="6.728"> She mused, resolved, adhered to her resolve; </l>
            <l n="6.729"> The hand grew slack in alms-giving, the heart </l>
            <l n="6.730"> Closed by degrees to charity; heaven's blessing </l>
            <l n="6.731"> Not seeking from that source, she placed her trust </l>
            <l n="6.732"> In ceaseless pains—and strictest parsimony </l>
            <l n="6.733"> Which sternly hoarded all that could be spared, </l>
            <l n="6.734"> From each day's need, out of each day's least gain. </l>
            <l n="6.735">   Thus all was re-established, and a pile </l>
            <l n="6.736"> Constructed, that sufficed for every end, </l>
            <l n="6.737"> Save the contentment of the builder's mind; </l>
            <l n="6.738"> A mind by nature indisposed to aught </l>
            <l n="6.739"> So placid, so inactive, as content; </l>
            <l n="6.740"> A mind intolerant of lasting peace, </l>
            <l n="6.741"> And cherishing the pang her heart deplored. </l>
            <l n="6.742"> Dread life of conflict! which I oft compared </l>
            <l n="6.743"> To the agitation of a brook that runs </l>
            <l n="6.744"> Down a rocky mountain, buried now and lost </l>
            <l n="6.745"> In silent pools, now in strong eddies chained; </l>
            <l n="6.746"> But never to be charmed to gentleness: </l>
            <l n="6.747"> Its best attainment fits of such repose </l>
            <l n="6.748"> As timid eyes might shrink from fathoming. </l>
            <l n="6.749">   A sudden illness seized her in the strength </l>
            <l n="6.750"> Of life's autumnal season.—Shall I tell </l>
            <l n="6.751"> How on her bed of death the Matron lay, </l>
            <l n="6.752"> To Providence submissive, so she thought; </l>
            <l n="6.753"> But fretted, vexed, and wrought upon, almost </l>
            <l n="6.754"> To anger, by the malady that griped </l>
            <l n="6.755"> Her prostrate frame with unrelaxing power, </l>
            <l n="6.756"> As the fierce eagle fastens on the lamb? </l>
            <l n="6.757"> She prayed, she moaned;—her husband's sister watched </l>
            <l n="6.758"> Her dreary pillow, waited on her needs; </l>
            <l n="6.759"> And yet the very sound of that kind foot </l>
            <l n="6.760"> Was anguish to her ears! 'And must she rule,' </l>
            <l n="6.761"> This was the death-doomed Woman heard to say </l>
            <l n="6.762"> In bitterness, 'and must she rule and reign, </l>
            <l n="6.763"> 'Sole Mistress of this house, when I am gone? </l>
            <l n="6.764"> 'Tend what I tended, calling it her own!' </l>
            <l n="6.765"> Enough;—I fear, too much.—One vernal evening, </l>
            <l n="6.766"> While she was yet in prime of health and strength, </l>
            <l n="6.767"> I well remember, while I passed her door </l>
            <l n="6.768"> Alone, with loitering step, and upward eye </l>
            <l n="6.769"> Turned towards the planet Jupiter that hung </l>
            <l n="6.770"> Above the centre of the Vale, a voice </l>
            <l n="6.771"> Roused me, her voice; it said, 'That glorious star </l>
            <l n="6.772"> 'In its untroubled element will shine </l>
            <l n="6.773"> 'As now it shines, when we are laid in earth </l>
            <l n="6.774"> 'And safe from all our sorrows.' With a sigh </l>
            <l n="6.775"> She spake, yet, I believe, not unsustained </l>
            <l n="6.776"> By faith in glory that shall far transcend </l>
            <l n="6.777"> Aught by these perishable heavens disclosed </l>
            <l n="6.778"> To sight or mind. Nor less than care divine </l>
            <l n="6.779"> Is divine mercy. She, who had rebelled, </l>
            <l n="6.780"> Was into meekness softened and subdued; </l>
            <l n="6.781"> Did, after trials not in vain prolonged, </l>
            <l n="6.782"> With resignation sink into the grave; </l>
            <l n="6.783"> And her uncharitable acts, I trust, </l>
            <l n="6.784"> And harsh unkindnesses are all forgiven, </l>
            <l n="6.785"> Tho', in this Vale, remembered with deep awe.” </l>

            <l n="6.787"> THE Vicar paused; and toward a seat advanced, </l>
            <l n="6.788"> A long stone-seat, fixed in the Churchyard wall; </l>
            <l n="6.789"> Part shaded by cool sycamore, and part </l>
            <l n="6.790"> Offering a sunny resting-place to them </l>
            <l n="6.791"> Who seek the House of worship, while the bells </l>
            <l n="6.792"> Yet ring with all their voices, or before </l>
            <l n="6.793"> The last hath ceased its solitary knoll. </l>
            <l n="6.794"> Beneath the shade we all sate down; and there, </l>
            <l n="6.795"> His office, uninvited, he resumed. </l>
            <l n="6.796">   “As on a sunny bank, a tender lamb </l>

            <l n="6.842"> Stands in our valley, named THE JOYFUL TREE; </l>
            <l n="6.843"> From dateless usage which our peasants hold </l>
            <l n="6.844"> Of giving welcome to the first of May </l>
            <l n="6.845"> By dances round its trunk.—And if the sky </l>
            <l n="6.846"> Permit, like honours, dance and song, are paid </l>
            <l n="6.847"> To the Twelfth Night, beneath the frosty stars </l>
            <l n="6.848"> Or the clear moon. The queen of these gay sports, </l>
            <l n="6.849"> If not in beauty yet in sprightly air, </l>
            <l n="6.850"> Was hapless Ellen.—No one touched the ground </l>
            <l n="6.851"> So deftly, and the nicest maiden's locks </l>
            <l n="6.852"> Less gracefully were braided;—but this praise, </l>
            <l n="6.853"> Methinks, would better suit another place. </l>
            <l n="6.854">   She loved, and fondly deemed herself beloved. </l>
            <l n="6.855"> —The road is dim, the current unperceived, </l>
            <l n="6.856"> The weakness painful and most pitiful, </l>
            <l n="6.857"> By which a virtuous woman, in pure youth, </l>
            <l n="6.858"> May be delivered to distress and shame. </l>
            <l n="6.859"> Such fate was hers.—The last time Ellen danced, </l>
            <l n="6.860"> Among her equals, round THE JOYFUL TREE, </l>
            <l n="6.861"> She bore a secret burthen; and full soon </l>
            <l n="6.862"> Was left to tremble for a breaking vow,— </l>
            <l n="6.863"> Then, to bewail a sternly-broken vow, </l>
            <l n="6.864"> Alone, within her widowed Mother's house. </l>
            <l n="6.865"> It was the season of unfolding leaves, </l>
            <l n="6.866"> Of days advancing toward their utmost length, </l>
            <l n="6.867"> And small birds singing happily to mates </l>
            <l n="6.868"> Happy as they. With spirit-saddening power </l>
            <l n="6.869"> Winds pipe through fading woods; but those blithe notes </l>
            <l n="6.870"> Strike the deserted to the heart; I speak </l>
            <l n="6.871"> Of what I know, and what we feel within. </l>
            <l n="6.872"> —Beside the cottage in which Ellen dwelt </l>
            <l n="6.873"> Stands a tall ash-tree; to whose topmost twig </l>
            <l n="6.874"> A thrush resorts, and annually chants, </l>
            <l n="6.875"> At morn and evening from that naked perch, </l>
            <l n="6.876"> While all the undergrove is thick with leaves, </l>
            <l n="6.877"> A time-beguiling ditty, for delight </l>
            <l n="6.878"> Of his fond partner, silent in the nest. </l>
            <l n="6.879"> —'Ah why,' said Ellen, sighing to herself, </l>
            <l n="6.880"> 'Why do not words, and kiss, and solemn pledge; </l>
            <l n="6.881"> 'And nature that is kind in woman's breast, </l>
            <l n="6.882"> 'And reason that in man is wise and good, </l>
            <l n="6.883"> 'And fear of him who is a righteous judge; </l>
            <l n="6.884"> 'Why do not these prevail for human life, </l>
            <l n="6.885"> 'To keep two hearts together, that began </l>
            <l n="6.886"> 'Their spring-time with one love, and that have need </l>
            <l n="6.887"> 'Of mutual pity and forgiveness, sweet </l>
            <l n="6.888"> 'To grant, or be received; while that poor bird— </l>
            <l n="6.889"> 'O come and hear him! Thou who hast to me </l>
            <l n="6.890"> 'Been faithless, hear him, though a lowly creature, </l>
            <l n="6.891"> 'One of God's simple children that yet know not </l>
            <l n="6.892"> 'The universal Parent, how he sings </l>
            <l n="6.893"> 'As if he wished the firmament of heaven </l>
            <l n="6.894"> 'Should listen, and give back to him the voice </l>
            <l n="6.895"> 'Of his triumphant constancy and love; </l>
            <l n="6.896"> 'The proclamation that he makes, how far </l>
            <l n="6.897"> 'His darkness doth transcend our fickle light!' </l>
            <l n="6.898">   Such was the tender passage, not by me </l>
            <l n="6.899"> Repeated without loss of simple phrase, </l>
            <l n="6.900"> Which I perused, even as the words had been </l>
            <l n="6.901"> Committed by forsaken Ellen's hand </l>
            <l n="6.902"> To the blank margin of a Valentine, </l>
            <l n="6.903"> Bedropped with tears. 'Twill please you to be told </l>
            <l n="6.904"> That, studiously withdrawing from the eye </l>
            <l n="6.905"> Of all companionship, the Sufferer yet </l>
            <l n="6.906"> In lonely reading found a meek resource: </l>
            <l n="6.907"> How thankful for the warmth of summer days, </l>
            <l n="6.908"> When she could slip into the cottage-barn, </l>
            <l n="6.909"> And find a secret oratory there; </l>
            <l n="6.910"> Or, in the garden, under friendly veil </l>
            <l n="6.911"> Of their long twilight, pore upon her book </l>
            <l n="6.912"> By the last lingering help of the open sky </l>
            <l n="6.913"> Until dark night dismissed her to her bed! </l>
            <l n="6.914"> Thus did a waking fancy sometimes lose </l>
            <l n="6.915"> The unconquerable pang of despised love. </l>
            <l n="6.916">   A kindlier passion opened on her soul </l>
            <l n="6.917"> When that poor Child was born. Upon its face </l>
            <l n="6.918"> She gazed as on a pure and spotless gift </l>
            <l n="6.919"> Of unexpected promise, where a grief </l>
            <l n="6.920"> Or dread was all that had been thought of,—joy </l>
            <l n="6.921"> Far livelier than bewildered traveller feels, </l>
            <l n="6.922"> Amid a perilous waste that all night long </l>
            <l n="6.923"> Hath harassed him toiling through fearful storm, </l>
            <l n="6.924"> When he beholds the first pale speck serene </l>
            <l n="6.925"> Of day-spring, in the gloomy east, revealed, </l>
            <l n="6.926"> And greets it with thanksgiving. 'Till this hour,' </l>
            <l n="6.927"> Thus, in her Mother's hearing Ellen spake, </l>
            <l n="6.928"> 'There was a stony region in my heart; </l>
            <l n="6.929"> 'But He, at whose command the parched rock </l>
            <l n="6.930"> 'Was smitten, and poured forth a quenching stream, </l>
            <l n="6.931"> 'Hath softened that obduracy, and made </l>
            <l n="6.932"> 'Unlooked-for gladness in the desert place, </l>
            <l n="6.933"> 'To save the perishing; and, henceforth, I breathe </l>
            <l n="6.934"> 'The air with cheerful spirit, for thy sake </l>
            <l n="6.935"> 'My infant! and for that good Mother dear, </l>
            <l n="6.936"> 'Who bore me; and hath prayed for me in vain;— </l>
            <l n="6.937"> 'Yet not in vain; it shall not be in vain.' </l>
            <l n="6.938"> She spake, nor was the assurance unfulfilled; </l>
            <l n="6.939"> And if heart-rending thoughts would oft return, </l>
            <l n="6.940"> They stayed not long.—The blameless Infant grew </l>
            <l n="6.941"> The Child whom Ellen and her Mother loved </l>
            <l n="6.942"> They soon were proud of; tended it and nursed; </l>
            <l n="6.943"> A soothing comforter, although forlorn; </l>
            <l n="6.944"> Like a poor singing-bird from distant lands; </l>
            <l n="6.945"> Or a choice shrub, which he, who passes by </l>
            <l n="6.946"> With vacant mind, not seldom may observe </l>
            <l n="6.947"> Fair-flowering in a thinly-peopled house, </l>
            <l n="6.948"> Whose window, somewhat sadly, it adorns. </l>
            <l n="6.949">   Through four months' space the Infant drew its food </l>
            <l n="6.950"> From the maternal breast; then scruples rose; </l>
            <l n="6.951"> Thoughts, which the rich are free from, came and crossed </l>
            <l n="6.952"> The fond affection. She no more could bear </l>
            <l n="6.953"> By her offence to lay a twofold weight </l>
            <l n="6.954"> On a kind parent willing to forget </l>
            <l n="6.955"> Their slender means: so, to that parent's care </l>
            <l n="6.956"> Trusting her child, she left their common home, </l>
            <l n="6.957"> And undertook with dutiful content </l>
            <l n="6.958"> A Foster-mother's office. </l>
            <l n="6.959">                            'Tis, perchance, </l>
            <l n="6.960"> Unknown to you that in these simple vales </l>
            <l n="6.961"> The natural feeling of equality </l>
            <l n="6.962"> Is by domestic service unimpaired; </l>
            <l n="6.963"> Yet, though such service be, with us, removed </l>
            <l n="6.964"> From sense of degradation, not the less </l>
            <l n="6.965"> The ungentle mind can easily find means </l>
            <l n="6.966"> To impose severe restraints and laws unjust, </l>
            <l n="6.967"> Which hapless Ellen now was doomed to feel: </l>
            <l n="6.968"> For (blinded by an over-anxious dread </l>
            <l n="6.969"> Of such excitement and divided thought </l>
            <l n="6.970"> As with her office would but ill accord) </l>
            <l n="6.971"> The pair, whose infant she was bound to nurse, </l>
            <l n="6.972"> Forbade her all communion with her own: </l>
            <l n="6.973"> Week after week, the mandate they enforced. </l>
            <l n="6.974"> —So near! yet not allowed, upon that sight </l>
            <l n="6.975"> To fix her eyes—alas! 'twas hard to bear! </l>
            <l n="6.976"> But worse affliction must be borne—far worse; </l>
            <l n="6.977"> For 'tis Heaven's will—that, after a disease </l>
            <l n="6.978"> Begun and ended within three days' space, </l>
            <l n="6.979"> Her child should die; as Ellen now exclaimed, </l>
            <l n="6.980"> Her own—deserted child!—Once, only once, </l>
            <l n="6.981"> She saw it in that mortal malady; </l>
            <l n="6.982"> And, on the burial-day, could scarcely gain </l>
            <l n="6.983"> Permission to attend its obsequies. </l>
            <l n="6.984"> She reached the house, last of the funeral train; </l>
            <l n="6.985"> And some one, as she entered, having chanced </l>
            <l n="6.986"> To urge unthinkingly their prompt departure, </l>
            <l n="6.987"> 'Nay,' said she, with commanding look, a spirit </l>
            <l n="6.988"> Of anger never seen in her before, </l>
            <l n="6.989"> 'Nay, ye must wait my time!' and down she sate, </l>
            <l n="6.990"> And by the unclosed coffin kept her seat </l>
            <l n="6.991"> Weeping and looking, looking on and weeping, </l>
            <l n="6.992"> Upon the last sweet slumber of her Child, </l>
            <l n="6.993"> Until at length her soul was satisfied. </l>
            <l n="6.994">   You see the Infant's Grave; and to this spot, </l>
            <l n="6.995"> The Mother, oft as she was sent abroad, </l>
            <l n="6.996"> On whatsoever errand, urged her steps: </l>
            <l n="6.997"> Hither she came; here stood, and sometimes knelt </l>
            <l n="6.998"> In the broad day, a rueful Magdalene! </l>
            <l n="6.999"> So call her; for not only she bewailed </l>
            <l n="6.1000"> A mother's loss, but mourned in bitterness </l>
            <l n="6.1001"> Her own transgression; penitent sincere </l>
            <l n="6.1002"> As ever raised to heaven a streaming eye? </l>
            <l n="6.1003"> —At length the parents of the foster-child, </l>
            <l n="6.1004"> Noting that in despite of their commands </l>
            <l n="6.1005"> She still renewed and could not but renew </l>
            <l n="6.1006"> Those visitations, ceased to send her forth; </l>
            <l n="6.1007"> Or, to the garden's narrow bounds, confined. </l>
            <l n="6.1008"> I failed not to remind them that they erred; </l>
            <l n="6.1009"> For holy Nature might not thus be crossed, </l>
            <l n="6.1010"> Thus wronged in woman's breast: in vain I pleaded— </l>
            <l n="6.1011"> But the green stalk of Ellen's life was snapped, </l>
            <l n="6.1012"> And the flower drooped; as every eye could see, </l>
            <l n="6.1013"> It hung its head in mortal languishment. </l>
            <l n="6.1014"> —Aided by this appearance, I at length </l>
            <l n="6.1015"> Prevailed; and, from those bonds released, she went </l>
            <l n="6.1016"> Home to her mother's house. </l>
            <l n="6.1017">                              The Youth was fled; </l>
            <l n="6.1018"> The rash betrayer could not face the shame </l>
            <l n="6.1019"> Or sorrow which his senseless guilt had caused; </l>
            <l n="6.1020"> And little would his presence, or proof given </l>
            <l n="6.1021"> Of a relenting soul, have now availed; </l>
            <l n="6.1022"> For, like a shadow, he was passed away </l>
            <l n="6.1023"> From Ellen's thoughts; had perished to her mind </l>
            <l n="6.1024"> For all concerns of fear, or hope, or love, </l>
            <l n="6.1025"> Save only those which to their common shame, </l>
            <l n="6.1026"> And to his moral being appertained: </l>
            <l n="6.1027"> Hope from that quarter would, I know, have brought </l>
            <l n="6.1028"> A heavenly comfort; there she recognised </l>
            <l n="6.1029"> An unrelaxing bond, a mutual need; </l>
            <l n="6.1030"> There, and, as seemed, there only. </l>
            <l n="6.1031">                                     She had built, </l>
            <l n="6.1032"> Her fond maternal heart had built, a nest </l>
            <l n="6.1033"> In blindness all too near the river's edge; </l>
            <l n="6.1034"> That work a summer flood with hasty swell </l>
            <l n="6.1035"> Had swept away; and now her Spirit longed </l>
            <l n="6.1036"> For its last flight to heaven's security. </l>
            <l n="6.1037"> —The bodily frame wasted from day to day; </l>
            <l n="6.1038"> Meanwhile, relinquishing all other cares, </l>
            <l n="6.1039"> Her mind she strictly tutored to find peace </l>
            <l n="6.1040"> And pleasure in endurance. Much she thought, </l>
            <l n="6.1041"> And much she read; and brooded feelingly </l>
            <l n="6.1042"> Upon her own unworthiness. To me, </l>
            <l n="6.1043"> As to a spiritual comforter and friend, </l>
            <l n="6.1044"> Her heart she opened; and no pains were spared </l>
            <l n="6.1045"> To mitigate, as gently as I could, </l>
            <l n="6.1046"> The sting of self-reproach, with healing words. </l>
            <l n="6.1047"> Meek Saint! through patience glorified on earth! </l>
            <l n="6.1048"> In whom, as by her lonely hearth she sate, </l>
            <l n="6.1049"> The ghastly face of cold decay put on </l>
            <l n="6.1050"> A sun-like beauty, and appeared divine! </l>
            <l n="6.1051"> May I not mention—that, within those walls, </l>
            <l n="6.1052"> In due observance of her pious wish, </l>
            <l n="6.1053"> The congregation joined with me in prayer </l>
            <l n="6.1054"> For her soul's good? Nor was that office vain. </l>
            <l n="6.1055"> —Much did she suffer: but, if any friend, </l>
            <l n="6.1056"> Beholding her condition, at the sight </l>
            <l n="6.1057"> Gave way to words of pity or complaint, </l>
            <l n="6.1058"> She stilled them with a prompt reproof, and said, </l>
            <l n="6.1059"> 'He who afflicts me knows what I can bear; </l>
            <l n="6.1060"> 'And, when I fail, and can endure no more, </l>
            <l n="6.1061"> 'Will mercifully take me to himself.' </l>
            <l n="6.1062"> So, through the cloud of death, her Spirit passed </l>
            <l n="6.1063"> Into that pure and unknown world of love </l>
            <l n="6.1064"> Where injury cannot come:—and here is laid </l>
            <l n="6.1065"> The mortal Body by her Infant's side.” </l>
            <l n="6.1066">   The Vicar ceased; and downcast looks made known </l>
            <l n="6.1067"> That each had listened with his inmost heart. </l>
            <l n="6.1068"> For me, the emotion scarcely was less strong </l>
            <l n="6.1069"> Or less benign than that which I had felt </l>
            <l n="6.1070"> When seated near my venerable Friend, </l>
            <l n="6.1071"> Under those shady elms, from him I heard </l>
            <l n="6.1072"> The story that retraced the slow decline </l>
            <l n="6.1073"> Of Margaret, sinking on the lonely heath </l>
            <l n="6.1074"> With the neglected house to which she clung. </l>
            <l n="6.1075"> —I noted that the Solitary's cheek </l>
            <l n="6.1076"> Confessed the power of nature.—Pleased though sad, </l>
            <l n="6.1077"> More pleased than sad, the grey-haired Wanderer sate; </l>
            <l n="6.1078"> Thanks to his pure imaginative soul </l>
            <l n="6.1079"> Capacious and serene; his blameless life, </l>
            <l n="6.1080"> His knowledge, wisdom, love of truth, and love </l>
            <l n="6.1081"> Of human kind! He was it who first broke </l>
            <l n="6.1082"> The pensive silence, saying:— </l>
            <l n="6.1083">                                 “Blest are they </l>
            <l n="6.1084"> Whose sorrow rather is to suffer wrong </l>
            <l n="6.1085"> Than to do wrong, albeit themselves have erred. </l>
            <l n="6.1086"> This tale gives proof that Heaven most gently deals </l>
            <l n="6.1087"> With such, in their affliction.—Ellen's fate, </l>
            <l n="6.1088"> Her tender spirit, and her contrite heart, </l>
            <l n="6.1089"> Call to my mind dark hints which I have heard </l>
            <l n="6.1090"> Of one who died within this vale, by doom </l>
            <l n="6.1091"> Heavier, as his offence was heavier far. </l>
            <l n="6.1092"> Where, Sir, I pray you, where are laid the bones </l>
            <l n="6.1093"> Of Wilfrid Armathwaite?” </l>
            <l n="6.1094">                           The Vicar answered, </l>
            <l n="6.1095"> “In that green nook, close by the Churchyard wall, </l>
            <l n="6.1096"> Beneath yon hawthorn, planted by myself </l>
            <l n="6.1097"> In memory and for warning, and in sign </l>
            <l n="6.1098"> Of sweetness where dire anguish had been known, </l>
            <l n="6.1099"> Of reconcilement after deep offence— </l>
            <l n="6.1100"> There doth he rest. No theme his fate supplies </l>
            <l n="6.1101"> For the smooth glozings of the indulgent world; </l>
            <l n="6.1102"> Nor need the windings of his devious course </l>
            <l n="6.1103"> Be here retraced;—enough that, by mishap </l>
            <l n="6.1104"> And venial error, robbed of competence, </l>
            <l n="6.1105"> And her obsequious shadow, peace of mind, </l>
            <l n="6.1106"> He craved a substitute in troubled joy; </l>
            <l n="6.1107"> Against his conscience rose in arms, and, braving </l>
            <l n="6.1108"> Divine displeasure, broke the marriage-vow. </l>
            <l n="6.1109"> That which he had been weak enough to do </l>
            <l n="6.1110"> Was misery in remembrance; he was stung, </l>
            <l n="6.1111"> Stung by his inward thoughts, and by the smiles </l>
            <l n="6.1112"> Of wife and children stung to agony. </l>
            <l n="6.1113"> Wretched at home, he gained no peace abroad; </l>
            <l n="6.1114"> Ranged through the mountains, slept upon the earth, </l>
            <l n="6.1115"> Asked comfort of the open air, and found </l>
            <l n="6.1116"> No quiet in the darkness of the night, </l>
            <l n="6.1117"> No pleasure in the beauty of the day. </l>
            <l n="6.1118"> His flock he slighted: his paternal fields </l>
            <l n="6.1119"> Became a clog to him, whose spirit wished </l>
            <l n="6.1120"> To fly—but whither! And this gracious Church, </l>
            <l n="6.1121"> That wears a look so full of peace and hope </l>
            <l n="6.1122"> And love, benignant mother of the vale, </l>
            <l n="6.1123"> How fair amid her brood of cottages! </l>
            <l n="6.1124"> She was to him a sickness and reproach. </l>
            <l n="6.1125"> Much to the last remained unknown: but this </l>
            <l n="6.1126"> Is sure, that through remorse and grief he died; </l>
            <l n="6.1127"> Though pitied among men, absolved by God, </l>
            <l n="6.1128"> He could not find forgiveness in himself; </l>
            <l n="6.1129"> Nor could endure the weight of his own shame. </l>
            <l n="6.1130">   Here rests a Mother. But from her I turn </l>
            <l n="6.1131"> And from her grave.—Behold—upon that ridge, </l>
            <l n="6.1132"> That, stretching boldly from the mountain side, </l>
            <l n="6.1133"> Carries into the centre of the vale </l>
            <l n="6.1134"> Its rocks and woods—the Cottage where she dwelt </l>
            <l n="6.1135"> And where yet dwells her faithful Partner, left </l>
            <l n="6.1136"> (Full eight years past) the solitary prop </l>
            <l n="6.1137"> Of many helpless Children. I begin </l>
            <l n="6.1138"> With words that might be prelude to a tale </l>
            <l n="6.1139"> Of sorrow and dejection; but I feel </l>
            <l n="6.1140"> No sadness, when I think of what mine eyes </l>
            <l n="6.1141"> See daily in that happy family. </l>
            <l n="6.1142"> —Bright garland form they for the pensive brow </l>
            <l n="6.1143"> Of their undrooping Father's widowhood, </l>
            <l n="6.1144"> Those six fair Daughters, budding yet—not one, </l>
            <l n="6.1145"> Not one of all the band, a full-blown flower. </l>
            <l n="6.1146"> Deprest, and desolate of soul, as once </l>
            <l n="6.1147"> That Father was, and filled with anxious fear, </l>
            <l n="6.1148"> Now, by experience taught, he stands assured, </l>
            <l n="6.1149"> That God, who takes away, yet takes not half </l>
            <l n="6.1150"> Of what he seems to take; or gives it back, </l>
            <l n="6.1151"> Not to our prayer, but far beyond our prayer; </l>
            <l n="6.1152"> He gives it—the boon produce of a soil </l>
            <l n="6.1153"> Which our endeavours have refused to till, </l>
            <l n="6.1154"> And hope hath never watered. The Abode, </l>
            <l n="6.1155"> Whose grateful owner can attest these truths, </l>
            <l n="6.1156"> Even were the object nearer to our sight, </l>
            <l n="6.1157"> Would seem in no distinction to surpass </l>
            <l n="6.1158"> The rudest habitations. Ye might think </l>
            <l n="6.1159"> That it had sprung self-raised from earth, or grown </l>
            <l n="6.1160"> Out of the living rock, to be adorned </l>
            <l n="6.1161"> By nature only; but, if thither led, </l>
            <l n="6.1162"> Ye would discover, then, a studious work </l>
            <l n="6.1163"> Of many fancies, prompting many hands. </l>
            <l n="6.1164">   Brought from the woods the honeysuckle twines </l>
            <l n="6.1165"> Around the porch, and seems, in that trim place, </l>
            <l n="6.1166"> A plant no longer wild; the cultured rose </l>
            <l n="6.1167"> There blossoms, strong in health, and will be soon </l>
            <l n="6.1168"> Roof-high; the wild pink crowns the garden-wall, </l>
            <l n="6.1169"> And with the flowers are intermingled stones </l>
            <l n="6.1170"> Sparry and bright, rough scatterings of the hills. </l>
            <l n="6.1171"> These ornaments, that fade not with the year, </l>
            <l n="6.1172"> A hardy Girl continues to provide; </l>
            <l n="6.1173"> Who, mounting fearlessly the rocky heights, </l>
            <l n="6.1174"> Her Father's prompt attendant, does for him </l>
            <l n="6.1175"> All that a boy could do, but with delight </l>
            <l n="6.1176"> More keen and prouder daring; yet hath she, </l>
            <l n="6.1177"> Within the garden, like the rest, a bed </l>
            <l n="6.1178"> For her own flowers and favourite herbs, a space, </l>
            <l n="6.1179"> By sacred charter, holden for her use. </l>
            <l n="6.1180"> —These, and whatever else the garden bears </l>
            <l n="6.1181"> Of fruit or flower, permission asked or not, </l>
            <l n="6.1182"> I freely gather; and my leisure draws </l>
            <l n="6.1183"> A not unfrequent pastime from the hum </l>
            <l n="6.1184"> Of bees around their range of sheltered hives </l>
            <l n="6.1185"> Busy in that enclosure; while the rill, </l>
            <l n="6.1186"> That sparkling thrids the rocks, attunes his voice </l>
            <l n="6.1187"> To the pure course of human life which there </l>
            <l n="6.1188"> Flows on in solitude. But, when the gloom </l>
            <l n="6.1189"> Of night is falling round my steps, then most </l>
            <l n="6.1190"> This Dwelling charms me; often I stop short, </l>
            <l n="6.1191"> (Who could refrain?) and feed by stealth my sight </l>
            <l n="6.1192"> With prospect of the company within, </l>
            <l n="6.1193"> Laid open through the blazing window:—there </l>
            <l n="6.1194"> I see the eldest Daughter at her wheel </l>
            <l n="6.1195"> Spinning amain, as if to overtake </l>
            <l n="6.1196"> The never-halting time; or, in her turn, </l>
            <l n="6.1197"> Teaching some Novice of the sisterhood </l>
            <l n="6.1198"> That skill in this or other household work, </l>
            <l n="6.1199"> Which, from her Father's honoured hand, herself, </l>
            <l n="6.1200"> While she was yet a little-one, had learned. </l>
            <l n="6.1201"> Mild Man! he is not gay, but they are gay; </l>
            <l n="6.1202"> And the whole house seems filled with gaiety. </l>
            <l n="6.1203"> —Thrice happy, then, the Mother may be deemed, </l>
            <l n="6.1204"> The Wife, from whose consolatory grave </l>
            <l n="6.1205"> I turned, that ye in mind might witness where, </l>
            <l n="6.1206"> And how, her Spirit yet survives on earth!” </l>

            <l n="7.1"> WHILE thus from theme to theme the Historian passed, </l>
            <l n="7.2"> The words he uttered, and the scene that lay </l>
            <l n="7.3"> Before our eyes, awakened in my mind </l>
            <l n="7.4"> Vivid remembrance of those long-past hours; </l>
            <l n="7.5"> When, in the hollow of some shadowy vale, </l>
            <l n="7.6"> (What time the splendour of the setting sun </l>
            <l n="7.7"> Lay beautiful on Snowdon's sovereign brow, </l>
            <l n="7.8"> On Cader Idris, or huge Penmanmaur) </l>
            <l n="7.9"> A wandering Youth, I listened with delight </l>
            <l n="7.10"> To pastoral melody or warlike air, </l>
            <l n="7.11"> Drawn from the chords of the ancient British harp </l>
            <l n="7.12"> By some accomplished Master, while he sate </l>
            <l n="7.13"> Amid the quiet of the green recess, </l>
            <l n="7.14"> And there did inexhaustibly dispense </l>
            <l n="7.15"> An interchange of soft or solemn tunes, </l>
            <l n="7.16"> Tender or blithe; now, as the varying mood </l>
            <l n="7.17"> Of his own spirit urged,—now, as a voice </l>

            <l n="7.19"> Of his compatriot villagers (that hung </l>

            <l n="7.21"> Of the time-hallowed minstrelsy) required </l>
            <l n="7.22"> For their heart's ease or pleasure. Strains of power </l>
            <l n="7.23"> Were they, to seize and occupy the sense; </l>
            <l n="7.24"> But to a higher mark than song can reach </l>
            <l n="7.25"> Rose this pure eloquence. And, when the stream </l>
            <l n="7.26"> Which overflowed the soul was passed away, </l>
            <l n="7.27"> A consciousness remained that it had left, </l>
            <l n="7.28"> Deposited upon the silent shore </l>
            <l n="7.29"> Of memory, images and precious thoughts, </l>
            <l n="7.30"> That shall not die, and cannot be destroyed. </l>
            <l n="7.31">   “These grassy heaps lie amicably close,” </l>
            <l n="7.32"> Said I, “like surges heaving in the wind </l>
            <l n="7.33"> Along the surface of a mountain pool: </l>
            <l n="7.34"> Whence comes it, then, that yonder we behold </l>
            <l n="7.35"> Five graves, and only five, that rise together </l>
            <l n="7.36"> Unsociably sequestered, and encroaching </l>
            <l n="7.37"> On the smooth playground of the village-school?” </l>
            <l n="7.38">   The Vicar answered,—“No disdainful pride </l>
            <l n="7.39"> In them who rest beneath, nor any course </l>
            <l n="7.40"> Of strange or tragic accident, hath helped </l>
            <l n="7.41"> To place those hillocks in that lonely guise. </l>
            <l n="7.42"> —Once more look forth, and follow with your sight </l>
            <l n="7.43"> The length of road that from yon mountain's base </l>
            <l n="7.44"> Through bare enclosures stretches, 'till its line </l>
            <l n="7.45"> Is lost within a little tuft of trees; </l>
            <l n="7.46"> Then, reappearing in a moment, quits </l>
            <l n="7.47"> The cultured fields; and up the heathy waste, </l>
            <l n="7.48"> Mounts, as you see, in mazes serpentine, </l>
            <l n="7.49"> Led towards an easy outlet of the vale. </l>
            <l n="7.50"> That little shady spot, that sylvan tuft, </l>
            <l n="7.51"> By which the road is hidden, also hides </l>
            <l n="7.52"> A cottage from our view; though I discern </l>
            <l n="7.53"> (Ye scarcely can) amid its sheltering trees </l>
            <l n="7.54"> The smokeless chimney-top.— </l>
            <l n="7.55">                               All unembowered </l>
            <l n="7.56"> And naked stood that lowly Parsonage </l>
            <l n="7.57"> (For such in truth it is, and appertains </l>
            <l n="7.58"> To a small Chapel in the vale beyond) </l>
            <l n="7.59"> When hither came its last Inhabitant. </l>
            <l n="7.60"> Rough and forbidding were the choicest roads </l>
            <l n="7.61"> By which our northern wilds could then be crossed; </l>
            <l n="7.62"> And into most of these secluded vales </l>
            <l n="7.63"> Was no access for wain, heavy or light. </l>
            <l n="7.64"> So, at his dwelling-place the Priest arrived </l>
            <l n="7.65"> With store of household goods, in panniers slung </l>
            <l n="7.66"> On sturdy horses graced with jingling bells, </l>
            <l n="7.67"> And on the back of more ignoble beast; </l>
            <l n="7.68"> That, with like burthen of effects most prized </l>
            <l n="7.69"> Or easiest carried, closed the motley train. </l>
            <l n="7.70"> Young was I then, a schoolboy of eight years; </l>
            <l n="7.71"> But still, methinks, I see them as they passed </l>
            <l n="7.72"> In order, drawing toward their wished-for home. </l>
            <l n="7.73"> —Rocked by the motion of a trusty ass </l>
            <l n="7.74"> Two ruddy children hung, a well-poised freight, </l>
            <l n="7.75"> Each in his basket nodding drowsily; </l>
            <l n="7.76"> Their bonnets, I remember, wreathed with flowers, </l>
            <l n="7.77"> Which told it was the pleasant month of June; </l>
            <l n="7.78"> And, close behind, the comely Matron rode, </l>
            <l n="7.79"> A woman of soft speech and gracious smile, </l>
            <l n="7.80"> And with a lady's mien.—From far they came, </l>
            <l n="7.81"> Even from Northumbrian hills; yet theirs had been </l>
            <l n="7.82"> A merry journey, rich in pastime, cheered </l>
            <l n="7.83"> By music, prank, and laughter-stirring jest; </l>
            <l n="7.84"> And freak put on, and arch word dropped—to swell </l>
            <l n="7.85"> The cloud of fancy and uncouth surmise </l>
            <l n="7.86"> That gathered round the slowly-moving train. </l>
            <l n="7.87"> —'Whence do they come? and with what errand charged? </l>
            <l n="7.88"> 'Belong they to the fortune-telling tribe </l>

            <l n="7.97"> On many a staring countenance portrayed </l>
            <l n="7.98"> Of boor or burgher, as they marched along. </l>
            <l n="7.99"> And more than once their steadiness of face </l>
            <l n="7.100"> Was put to proof, and exercise supplied </l>
            <l n="7.101"> To their inventive humour, by stern looks, </l>
            <l n="7.102"> And questions in authoritative tone, </l>
            <l n="7.103"> From some staid guardian of the public peace, </l>
            <l n="7.104"> Checking the sober steed on which he rode, </l>
            <l n="7.105"> In his suspicious wisdom; oftener still, </l>
            <l n="7.106"> By notice indirect, or blunt demand </l>
            <l n="7.107"> From traveller halting in his own despite, </l>
            <l n="7.108"> A simple curiosity to ease: </l>
            <l n="7.109"> Of which adventures, that beguiled and cheered </l>
            <l n="7.110"> Their grave migration, the good pair would tell, </l>
            <l n="7.111"> With undiminished glee, in hoary age. </l>
            <l n="7.112">   A Priest he was by function; but his course </l>
            <l n="7.113"> From his youth up, and high as manhood's noon, </l>
            <l n="7.114"> (The hour of life to which he then was brought) </l>
            <l n="7.115"> Had been irregular, I might say, wild; </l>
            <l n="7.116"> By books unsteadied, by his pastoral care </l>
            <l n="7.117"> Too little checked. An active, ardent mind; </l>
            <l n="7.118"> A fancy pregnant with resource and scheme </l>
            <l n="7.119"> To cheat the sadness of a rainy day; </l>
            <l n="7.120"> Hands apt for all ingenious arts and games; </l>
            <l n="7.121"> A generous spirit, and a body strong </l>
            <l n="7.122"> To cope with stoutest champions of the bowl— </l>
            <l n="7.123"> Had earned for him sure welcome, and the rights </l>
            <l n="7.124"> Of a prized visitant, in the jolly hall </l>
            <l n="7.125"> Of country 'squire; or at the statelier board </l>
            <l n="7.126"> Of duke or earl, from scenes of courtly pomp </l>
            <l n="7.127"> Withdrawn,—to while away the summer hours </l>
            <l n="7.128"> In condescension among rural guests. </l>
            <l n="7.129">   With these high comrades he had revelled long, </l>
            <l n="7.130"> Frolicked industriously, a simple Clerk </l>
            <l n="7.131"> By hopes of coming patronage beguiled </l>
            <l n="7.132"> Till the heart sickened. So, each loftier aim </l>
            <l n="7.133"> Abandoning and all his showy friends, </l>
            <l n="7.134"> For a life's stay (slender it was, but sure) </l>
            <l n="7.135"> He turned to this secluded chapelry; </l>
            <l n="7.136"> That had been offered to his doubtful choice </l>
            <l n="7.137"> By an unthought-of patron. Bleak and bare </l>
            <l n="7.138"> They found the cottage, their allotted home; </l>
            <l n="7.139"> Naked without, and rude within; a spot </l>
            <l n="7.140"> With which the Cure not long had been endowed: </l>
            <l n="7.141"> And far remote the chapel stood,—remote, </l>
            <l n="7.142"> And, from his Dwelling, unapproachable, </l>
            <l n="7.143"> Save through a gap high in the hills, an opening </l>
            <l n="7.144"> Shadeless and shelterless, by driving showers </l>
            <l n="7.145"> Frequented, and beset with howling winds. </l>
            <l n="7.146"> Yet cause was none, whate'er regret might hang </l>
            <l n="7.147"> On his own mind, to quarrel with the choice </l>
            <l n="7.148"> Or the necessity that fixed him here; </l>
            <l n="7.149"> Apart from old temptations, and constrained </l>
            <l n="7.150"> To punctual labour in his sacred charge. </l>
            <l n="7.151"> See him a constant preacher to the poor! </l>
            <l n="7.152"> And visiting, though not with saintly zeal, </l>
            <l n="7.153"> Yet, when need was, with no reluctant will, </l>
            <l n="7.154"> The sick in body, or distrest in mind; </l>
            <l n="7.155"> And, by a salutary change, compelled </l>
            <l n="7.156"> To rise from timely sleep, and meet the day </l>
            <l n="7.157"> With no engagement, in his thoughts, more proud </l>
            <l n="7.158"> Or splendid than his garden could afford, </l>
            <l n="7.159"> His fields, or mountains by the heath-cock ranged </l>
            <l n="7.160"> Or the wild brooks; from which he now returned </l>
            <l n="7.161"> Contented to partake the quiet meal </l>
            <l n="7.162"> Of his own board, where sat his gentle Mate </l>
            <l n="7.163"> And three fair Children, plentifully fed </l>
            <l n="7.164"> Though simply, from their little household farm; </l>
            <l n="7.165"> Nor wanted timely treat of fish or fowl </l>
            <l n="7.166"> By nature yielded to his practised hand;— </l>
            <l n="7.167"> To help the small but certain comings-in </l>
            <l n="7.168"> Of that spare benefice. Yet not the less </l>
            <l n="7.169"> Theirs was a hospitable board, and theirs </l>
            <l n="7.170"> A charitable door. </l>
            <l n="7.171">                     So days and years </l>
            <l n="7.172"> Passed on;—the inside of that rugged house </l>
            <l n="7.173"> Was trimmed and brightened by the Matron's care, </l>
            <l n="7.174"> And gradually enriched with things of price, </l>
            <l n="7.175"> Which might be lacked for use or ornament. </l>
            <l n="7.176"> What, though no soft and costly sofa there </l>
            <l n="7.177"> Insidiously stretched out its lazy length, </l>
            <l n="7.178"> And no vain mirror glittered upon the walls, </l>
            <l n="7.179"> Yet were the windows of the low abode </l>
            <l n="7.180"> By shutters weather-fended, which at once </l>
            <l n="7.181"> Repelled the storm and deadened its loud roar. </l>
            <l n="7.182"> There snow-white curtains hung in decent folds; </l>
            <l n="7.183"> Tough moss, and long-enduring mountain plants, </l>
            <l n="7.184"> That creep along the ground with sinuous trail, </l>
            <l n="7.185"> Were nicely braided; and composed a work </l>
            <l n="7.186"> Like Indian mats, that with appropriate grace </l>
            <l n="7.187"> Lay at the threshold and the inner doors; </l>
            <l n="7.188"> And a fair carpet, woven of homespun wool </l>
            <l n="7.189"> But tinctured daintily with florid hues, </l>
            <l n="7.190"> For seemliness and warmth, on festal days, </l>
            <l n="7.191"> Covered the smooth blue slabs of mountain-stone </l>
            <l n="7.192"> With which the parlour-floor, in simplest guise </l>
            <l n="7.193"> Of pastoral homesteads, had been long inlaid. </l>
            <l n="7.194">   Those pleasing works the Housewife's skill produced: </l>
            <l n="7.195"> Meanwhile the unsedentary Master's hand </l>
            <l n="7.196"> Was busier with his task—to rid, to plant, </l>
            <l n="7.197"> To rear for food, for shelter, and delight; </l>
            <l n="7.198"> A thriving covert! And when wishes, formed </l>
            <l n="7.199"> In youth, and sanctioned by the riper mind, </l>
            <l n="7.200"> Restored me to my native valley, here </l>
            <l n="7.201"> To end my days; well pleased was I to see </l>
            <l n="7.202"> The once-bare cottage, on the mountainside, </l>
            <l n="7.203"> Screened from assault of every bitter blast; </l>
            <l n="7.204"> While the dark shadows of the summer leaves </l>
            <l n="7.205"> Danced in the breeze, chequering its mossy roof. </l>
            <l n="7.206"> Time, which had thus afforded willing help </l>
            <l n="7.207"> To beautify with nature's fairest growths </l>
            <l n="7.208"> This rustic tenement, had gently shed, </l>
            <l n="7.209"> Upon its Master's frame, a wintry grace; </l>
            <l n="7.210"> The comeliness of unenfeebled age. </l>
            <l n="7.211">   But how could I say, gently? for he still </l>
            <l n="7.212"> Retained a flashing eye, a burning palm, </l>
            <l n="7.213"> A stirring foot, a head which beat at nights </l>
            <l n="7.214"> Upon its pillow with a thousand schemes. </l>
            <l n="7.215"> Few likings had he dropped, few pleasures lost; </l>
            <l n="7.216"> Generous and charitable, prompt to serve; </l>
            <l n="7.217"> And still his harsher passions kept their hold— </l>
            <l n="7.218"> Anger and indignation. Still he loved </l>
            <l n="7.219"> The sound of titled names, and talked in glee </l>
            <l n="7.220"> Of long-past banquetings with high-born friends: </l>
            <l n="7.221"> Then, from those lulling fits of vain delight </l>
            <l n="7.222"> Uproused by recollected injury, railed </l>
            <l n="7.223"> At their false ways disdainfully,—and oft </l>
            <l n="7.224"> In bitterness, and with a threatening eye </l>
            <l n="7.225"> Of fire, incensed beneath its hoary brow. </l>
            <l n="7.226"> —Those transports, with staid looks of pure good-will, </l>
            <l n="7.227"> And with soft smile, his consort would reprove. </l>
            <l n="7.228"> She, far behind him in the race of years, </l>
            <l n="7.229"> Yet keeping her first mildness, was advanced </l>
            <l n="7.230"> Far nearer, in the habit of her soul, </l>
            <l n="7.231"> To that still region whither all are bound, </l>
            <l n="7.232"> Him might we liken to the setting sun </l>
            <l n="7.233"> As seen not seldom on some gusty day, </l>
            <l n="7.234"> Struggling and bold, and shining from the west </l>
            <l n="7.235"> With an inconstant and unmellowed light; </l>
            <l n="7.236"> She was a soft attendant cloud, that hung </l>
            <l n="7.237"> As if with wish to veil the restless orb; </l>
            <l n="7.238"> From which it did itself imbibe a ray </l>
            <l n="7.239"> Of pleasing lustre.—But no more of this; </l>
            <l n="7.240"> I better love to sprinkle on the sod </l>
            <l n="7.241"> That now divides the pair, or rather say, </l>
            <l n="7.242"> That still unites them, praises, like heaven's dew, </l>
            <l n="7.243"> Without reserve descending upon both. </l>
            <l n="7.244">   Our very first in eminence of years </l>
            <l n="7.245"> This old Man stood, the patriarch of the Vale! </l>
            <l n="7.246"> And, to his unmolested mansion, death </l>
            <l n="7.247"> Had never come, through space of forty years; </l>
            <l n="7.248"> Sparing both old and young in that abode. </l>
            <l n="7.249"> Suddenly then they disappeared: not twice </l>
            <l n="7.250"> Had summer scorched the fields; not twice had fallen, </l>
            <l n="7.251"> On those high peaks, the first autumnal snow, </l>
            <l n="7.252"> Before the greedy visiting was closed, </l>
            <l n="7.253"> And the long-privileged house left empty—swept </l>
            <l n="7.254"> As by a plague. Yet no rapacious plague </l>
            <l n="7.255"> Had been among them; all was gentle death, </l>
            <l n="7.256"> One after one, with intervals of peace. </l>
            <l n="7.257"> A happy consummation! an accord </l>
            <l n="7.258"> Sweet, perfect, to be wished for! save that here </l>
            <l n="7.259"> Was something which to mortal sense might sound </l>
            <l n="7.260"> Like harshness,—that the old grey-headed Sire, </l>
            <l n="7.261"> The oldest, he was taken last; survived </l>
            <l n="7.262"> When the meek Partner of his age, his Son, </l>
            <l n="7.263"> His Daughter, and that late and high-prized gift, </l>
            <l n="7.264"> His little smiling Grandchild, were no more. </l>
            <l n="7.265">   'All gone all vanished! he deprived and bare, </l>
            <l n="7.266"> 'How will he face the remnant of his life? </l>
            <l n="7.267"> 'What will become of him?' we said, and mused </l>
            <l n="7.268"> In sad conjectures—'Shall we meet him now </l>
            <l n="7.269"> 'Haunting with rod and line the craggy brooks? </l>
            <l n="7.270"> 'Or shall we overhear him, as we pass, </l>
            <l n="7.271"> 'Striving to entertain the lonely hours </l>
            <l n="7.272"> 'With music?' (for he had not ceased to touch </l>
            <l n="7.273"> The harp or viol which himself had framed, </l>
            <l n="7.274"> For their sweet purposes, with perfect skill.) </l>
            <l n="7.275"> 'What titles will he keep? will he remain </l>
            <l n="7.276"> 'Musician, gardener, builder, mechanist, </l>

            <l n="7.278"> 'A man of hope and forward-looking mind </l>
            <l n="7.279"> 'Even to the last!'—Such was he, unsubdued. </l>
            <l n="7.280"> But Heaven was gracious; yet a little while, </l>
            <l n="7.281"> And this Survivor, with his cheerful throng </l>

            <l n="7.283"> Of unsunned griefs, too many and too keen, </l>
            <l n="7.284"> Was overcome by unexpected sleep, </l>
            <l n="7.285"> In one blest moment. Like a shadow thrown </l>
            <l n="7.286"> Softly and lightly from a passing cloud, </l>
            <l n="7.287"> Death fell upon him, while reclined he lay </l>
            <l n="7.288"> For noontide solace on the summer grass, </l>
            <l n="7.289"> The warm lap of his mother earth: and so, </l>
            <l n="7.290"> Their lenient term of separation past, </l>
            <l n="7.291"> That family (whose graves you there behold) </l>
            <l n="7.292"> By yet a higher privilege once more </l>

            <l n="7.298"> That might have touched the sick heart of his Friend </l>
            <l n="7.299"> Too nearly, or intent to reinforce </l>
            <l n="7.300"> His own firm spirit in degree deprest </l>
            <l n="7.301"> By tender sorrow for our mortal state) </l>
            <l n="7.302"> Thus silence broke:—“Behold a thoughtless Man </l>
            <l n="7.303"> From vice and premature decay preserved </l>
            <l n="7.304"> By useful habits, to a fitter soil </l>
            <l n="7.305"> Transplanted ere too late.—The hermit, lodged </l>
            <l n="7.306"> Amid the untrodden desert, tells his beads, </l>
            <l n="7.307"> With each repeating its allotted prayer, </l>
            <l n="7.308"> And thus divides and thus relieves the time; </l>
            <l n="7.309"> Smooth task, with 'his' compared, whose mind could string, </l>
            <l n="7.310"> Not scantily, bright minutes on the thread </l>
            <l n="7.311"> Of keen domestic anguish; and beguile </l>
            <l n="7.312"> A solitude, unchosen, unprofessed; </l>
            <l n="7.313"> Till gentlest death released him. </l>
            <l n="7.314">                                    Far from us </l>
            <l n="7.315"> Be the desire—too curiously to ask </l>
            <l n="7.316"> How much of this is but the blind result </l>
            <l n="7.317"> Of cordial spirits and vital temperament, </l>
            <l n="7.318"> And what to higher powers is justly due. </l>
            <l n="7.319"> But you, Sir, know that in a neighbouring vale </l>
            <l n="7.320"> A Priest abides before whose life such doubts </l>
            <l n="7.321"> Fall to the ground; whose gifts of nature lie </l>
            <l n="7.322"> Retired from notice, lost in attributes </l>
            <l n="7.323"> Of reason, honourably effaced by debts </l>
            <l n="7.324"> Which her poor treasure-house is content to owe, </l>
            <l n="7.325"> And conquest over her dominion gained, </l>
            <l n="7.326"> To which her frowardness must needs submit. </l>
            <l n="7.327"> In this one Man is shown a temperance—proof </l>
            <l n="7.328"> Against all trials; industry severe </l>
            <l n="7.329"> And constant as the motion of the day; </l>
            <l n="7.330"> Stern self-denial round him spread, with shade </l>

            <l n="7.333"> Forbearance, charity in deed and thought, </l>

            <l n="7.336"> All that her holy customs recommend, </l>

            <l n="7.347"> These titles emperors and chiefs have borne, </l>
            <l n="7.348"> Honour assumed or given: and him, the WONDERFUL, </l>
            <l n="7.349"> Our simple shepherds, speaking from the heart, </l>
            <l n="7.350"> Deservedly have styled.—From his abode </l>
            <l n="7.351"> In a dependent chapelry that lies </l>
            <l n="7.352"> Behind yon hill, a poor and rugged wild, </l>
            <l n="7.353"> Which in his soul he lovingly embraced, </l>
            <l n="7.354"> And, having once espoused, would never quit; </l>
            <l n="7.355"> Into its graveyard will ere long be borne </l>
            <l n="7.356"> That lowly, great, good Man. A simple stone </l>
            <l n="7.357"> May cover him; and by its help, perchance, </l>
            <l n="7.358"> A century shall hear his name pronounced, </l>
            <l n="7.359"> With images attendant on the sound; </l>
            <l n="7.360"> Then, shall the slowly-gathering twilight close </l>
            <l n="7.361"> In utter night; and of his course remain </l>
            <l n="7.362"> No cognizable vestiges, no more </l>
            <l n="7.363"> Than of this breath, which shapes itself in words </l>
            <l n="7.364"> To speak of him, and instantly dissolves.” </l>
            <l n="7.365">   The Pastor, pressed by thoughts which round his theme </l>
            <l n="7.366"> Still lingered, after a brief pause, resumed; </l>
            <l n="7.367"> “Noise is there not enough in doleful war, </l>
            <l n="7.368"> But that the heaven-born poet must stand forth, </l>
            <l n="7.369"> And lend the echoes of his sacred shell, </l>
            <l n="7.370"> To multiply and aggravate the din? </l>
            <l n="7.371"> Pangs are there not enough in hopeless love— </l>
            <l n="7.372"> And, in requited passion, all too much </l>
            <l n="7.373"> Of turbulence, anxiety, and fear— </l>
            <l n="7.374"> But that the minstrel of the rural shade </l>
            <l n="7.375"> Must tune his pipe, insidiously to nurse </l>
            <l n="7.376"> The perturbation in the suffering breast, </l>
            <l n="7.377"> And propagate its kind, far as he may? </l>
            <l n="7.378"> —Ah who (and with such rapture as befits </l>
            <l n="7.379"> The hallowed theme) will rise and celebrate </l>
            <l n="7.380"> The good man's purposes and deeds; retrace </l>
            <l n="7.381"> His struggles, his discomfitures deplore, </l>
            <l n="7.382"> His triumphs hail, and glorify his end; </l>
            <l n="7.383"> That virtue, like the fumes and vapoury clouds </l>
            <l n="7.384"> Through fancy's heat redounding in the brain, </l>
            <l n="7.385"> And like the soft infections of the heart, </l>
            <l n="7.386"> By charm of measured words may spread o'er field, </l>
            <l n="7.387"> Hamlet, and town; and piety survive </l>
            <l n="7.388"> Upon the lips of men in hall or bower; </l>
            <l n="7.389"> Not for reproof, but high and warm delight, </l>
            <l n="7.390"> And grave encouragement, by song inspired? </l>
            <l n="7.391"> —Vain thought! but wherefore murmur or repine? </l>
            <l n="7.392"> The memory of the just survives in heaven: </l>
            <l n="7.393"> And, without sorrow, will the ground receive </l>
            <l n="7.394"> That venerable clay. Meanwhile the best </l>
            <l n="7.395"> Of what lies here confines us to degrees </l>
            <l n="7.396"> In excellence less difficult to reach, </l>
            <l n="7.397"> And milder worth: nor need we travel far </l>
            <l n="7.398"> From those to whom our last regards were paid, </l>
            <l n="7.399"> For such example. </l>
            <l n="7.400">                    Almost at the root </l>
            <l n="7.401"> Of that tall pine, the shadow of whose bare </l>
            <l n="7.402"> And slender stem, while here I sit at eve, </l>
            <l n="7.403"> Oft stretches towards me, like a long straight path </l>
            <l n="7.404"> Traced faintly in the greensward; there, beneath </l>
            <l n="7.405"> A plain blue stone, a gentle Dalesman lies, </l>
            <l n="7.406"> From whom, in early childhood, was withdrawn </l>
            <l n="7.407"> The precious gift of hearing. He grew up </l>
            <l n="7.408"> From year to year in loneliness of soul; </l>
            <l n="7.409"> And this deep mountain-valley was to him </l>
            <l n="7.410"> Soundless, with all its streams. The bird of dawn </l>
            <l n="7.411"> Did never rouse this Cottager from sleep </l>
            <l n="7.412"> With startling summons; not for his delight </l>
            <l n="7.413"> The vernal cuckoo shouted; not for him </l>
            <l n="7.414"> Murmured the labouring bee. When stormy winds </l>
            <l n="7.415"> Were working the broad bosom of the lake </l>
            <l n="7.416"> Into a thousand thousand sparkling waves, </l>
            <l n="7.417"> Rocking the trees, or driving cloud on cloud </l>
            <l n="7.418"> Along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags, </l>
            <l n="7.419"> The agitated scene before his eye </l>
            <l n="7.420"> Was silent as a picture: evermore </l>
            <l n="7.421"> Were all things silent, wheresoe'er he moved. </l>
            <l n="7.422"> Yet, by the solace of his own pure thoughts </l>
            <l n="7.423"> Upheld, he duteously pursued the round </l>
            <l n="7.424"> Of rural labours; the steep mountain-side </l>
            <l n="7.425"> Ascended, with his staff and faithful dog; </l>
            <l n="7.426"> The plough he guided, and the scythe he swayed; </l>
            <l n="7.427"> And the ripe corn before his sickle fell </l>
            <l n="7.428"> Among the jocund reapers. For himself, </l>
            <l n="7.429"> All watchful and industrious as he was, </l>
            <l n="7.430"> He wrought not: neither field nor flock he owned: </l>
            <l n="7.431"> No wish for wealth had place within his mind; </l>
            <l n="7.432"> Nor husband's love, nor father's hope or care. </l>
            <l n="7.433">   Though born a younger brother, need was none </l>
            <l n="7.434"> That from the floor of his paternal home </l>
            <l n="7.435"> He should depart, to plant himself anew. </l>
            <l n="7.436"> And when, mature in manhood, he beheld </l>
            <l n="7.437"> His parents laid in earth, no loss ensued </l>
            <l n="7.438"> Of rights to him; but he remained well pleased, </l>
            <l n="7.439"> By the pure bond of independent love, </l>
            <l n="7.440"> An inmate of a second family; </l>
            <l n="7.441"> The fellow-labourer and friend of him </l>
            <l n="7.442"> To whom the small inheritance had fallen. </l>
            <l n="7.443"> —Nor deem that his mild presence was a weight </l>
            <l n="7.444"> That pressed upon his brother's house; for books </l>
            <l n="7.445"> Were ready comrades whom he could not tire; </l>
            <l n="7.446"> Of whose society the blameless Man </l>
            <l n="7.447"> Was never satiate. Their familiar voice, </l>
            <l n="7.448"> Even to old age, with unabated charm </l>
            <l n="7.449"> Beguiled his leisure hours; refreshed his thoughts; </l>
            <l n="7.450"> Beyond its natural elevation raised </l>
            <l n="7.451"> His introverted spirit; and bestowed </l>
            <l n="7.452"> Upon his life an outward dignity </l>
            <l n="7.453"> Which all acknowledged. The dark winter night, </l>
            <l n="7.454"> The stormy day, each had its own resource; </l>
            <l n="7.455"> Song of the muses, sage historic tale, </l>
            <l n="7.456"> Science severe, or word of holy Writ </l>
            <l n="7.457"> Announcing immortality and joy </l>
            <l n="7.458"> To the assembled spirits of just men </l>
            <l n="7.459"> Made perfect, and from injury secure. </l>
            <l n="7.460"> —Thus soothed at home, thus busy in the field, </l>
            <l n="7.461"> To no perverse suspicion he gave way, </l>
            <l n="7.462"> No languor, peevishness, nor vain complaint: </l>
            <l n="7.463"> And they, who were about him, did not fail </l>
            <l n="7.464"> In reverence, or in courtesy; they prized </l>
            <l n="7.465"> His gentle manners: and his peaceful smiles, </l>
            <l n="7.466"> The gleams of his slow-varying countenance, </l>
            <l n="7.467"> Were met with answering sympathy and love. </l>
            <l n="7.468">   At length, when sixty years and five were told, </l>
            <l n="7.469"> A slow disease insensibly consumed </l>
            <l n="7.470"> The powers of nature: and a few short steps </l>
            <l n="7.471"> Of friends and kindred bore him from his home </l>
            <l n="7.472"> (Yon cottage shaded by the woody crags) </l>
            <l n="7.473"> To the profounder stillness of the grave. </l>
            <l n="7.474"> —Nor was his funeral denied the grace </l>
            <l n="7.475"> Of many tears, virtuous and thoughtful grief; </l>
            <l n="7.476"> Heart-sorrow rendered sweet by gratitude. </l>
            <l n="7.477"> And now that monumental stone preserves </l>
            <l n="7.478"> His name, and unambitiously relates </l>
            <l n="7.479"> How long, and by what kindly outward aids, </l>
            <l n="7.480"> And in what pure contentedness of mind, </l>
            <l n="7.481"> The sad privation was by him endured. </l>
            <l n="7.482"> —And yon tall pine-tree, whose composing sound </l>
            <l n="7.483"> Was wasted on the good Man's living ear, </l>
            <l n="7.484"> Hath now its own peculiar sanctity; </l>
            <l n="7.485"> And, at the touch of every wandering breeze, </l>
            <l n="7.486"> Murmurs, not idly, o'er his peaceful grave. </l>
            <l n="7.487">   Soul-cheering Light, most bountiful of things! </l>
            <l n="7.488"> Guide of our way, mysterious comforter! </l>
            <l n="7.489"> Whose sacred influence, spread through earth and heaven, </l>
            <l n="7.490"> We all too thanklessly participate, </l>
            <l n="7.491"> Thy gifts were utterly withheld from him </l>
            <l n="7.492"> Whose place of rest is near yon ivied porch. </l>
            <l n="7.493"> Yet, of the wild brooks ask if he complained; </l>
            <l n="7.494"> Ask of the channelled rivers if they held </l>
            <l n="7.495"> A safer, easier, more determined, course. </l>
            <l n="7.496"> What terror doth it strike into the mind </l>
            <l n="7.497"> To think of one, blind and alone, advancing </l>
            <l n="7.498"> Straight toward some precipice's airy brink! </l>
            <l n="7.499"> But, timely warned, 'He' would have stayed his steps, </l>
            <l n="7.500"> Protected, say enlightened, by his ear; </l>
            <l n="7.501"> And on the very edge of vacancy </l>
            <l n="7.502"> Not more endangered than a man whose eye </l>
            <l n="7.503"> Beholds the gulf beneath.—No floweret blooms </l>
            <l n="7.504"> Throughout the lofty range of these rough hills, </l>
            <l n="7.505"> Nor in the woods, that could from him conceal </l>
            <l n="7.506"> Its birth-place; none whose figure did not live </l>
            <l n="7.507"> Upon his touch. The bowels of the earth </l>
            <l n="7.508"> Enriched with knowledge his industrious mind; </l>
            <l n="7.509"> The ocean paid him tribute from the stores </l>
            <l n="7.510"> Lodged in her bosom; and, by science led, </l>
            <l n="7.511"> His genius mounted to the plains of heaven. </l>
            <l n="7.512"> —Methinks I see him—how his eye-balls rolled, </l>
            <l n="7.513"> Beneath his ample brow, in darkness paired,— </l>

            <l n="7.518"> With eloquence, and such authentic power, </l>

            <l n="7.526"> And to the mind among her powers of sense </l>
            <l n="7.527"> This transfer is permitted,—not alone </l>
            <l n="7.528"> That the bereft their recompense may win; </l>
            <l n="7.529"> But for remoter purposes of love </l>
            <l n="7.530"> And charity; nor last nor least for this, </l>
            <l n="7.531"> That to the imagination may be given </l>
            <l n="7.532"> A type and shadow of an awful truth; </l>
            <l n="7.533"> How, likewise, under sufferance divine, </l>
            <l n="7.534"> Darkness is banished from the realms of death, </l>
            <l n="7.535"> By man's imperishable spirit, quelled. </l>
            <l n="7.536"> Unto the men who see not as we see </l>
            <l n="7.537"> Futurity was thought, in ancient times, </l>
            <l n="7.538"> To be laid open, and they prophesied. </l>
            <l n="7.539"> And know we not that from the blind have flowed </l>
            <l n="7.540"> The highest, holiest, raptures of the lyre; </l>
            <l n="7.541"> And wisdom married to immortal verse?” </l>
            <l n="7.542">   Among the humbler Worthies, at our feet </l>
            <l n="7.543"> Lying insensible to human praise, </l>
            <l n="7.544"> Love, or regret,—'whose' lineaments would next </l>
            <l n="7.545"> Have been portrayed, I guess not; but it chanced </l>
            <l n="7.546"> That, near the quiet churchyard where we sate, </l>
            <l n="7.547"> A team of horses, with a ponderous freight </l>
            <l n="7.548"> Pressing behind, adown a rugged slope, </l>
            <l n="7.549"> Whose sharp descent confounded their array, </l>
            <l n="7.550"> Came at that moment, ringing noisily. </l>
            <l n="7.551">   “Here,” said the Pastor, “do we muse, and mourn </l>
            <l n="7.552"> The waste of death; and lo! the giant oak </l>
            <l n="7.553"> Stretched on his bier—that massy timber wain; </l>
            <l n="7.554"> Nor fail to note the Man who guides the team.” </l>
            <l n="7.555">   He was a peasant of the lowest class: </l>
            <l n="7.556"> Grey locks profusely round his temples hung </l>
            <l n="7.557"> In clustering curls, like ivy, which the bite </l>
            <l n="7.558"> Of winter cannot thin; the fresh air lodged </l>
            <l n="7.559"> Within his cheek, as light within a cloud; </l>
            <l n="7.560"> And he returned our greeting with a smile. </l>
            <l n="7.561"> When he had passed, the Solitary spake; </l>
            <l n="7.562"> “A Man he seems of cheerful yesterdays </l>
            <l n="7.563"> And confident to-morrows; with a face </l>
            <l n="7.564"> Not worldly-minded, for it bears too much </l>
            <l n="7.565"> Of Nature's impress,—gaiety and health, </l>
            <l n="7.566"> Freedom and hope; but keen, withal, and shrewd. </l>
            <l n="7.567"> His gestures note,—and hark! his tones of voice </l>
            <l n="7.568"> Are all vivacious as his mien and looks.” </l>
            <l n="7.569">   The Pastor answered: “You have read him well. </l>
            <l n="7.570"> Year after year is added to his store </l>
            <l n="7.571"> With 'silent' increase: summers, winters—past, </l>
            <l n="7.572"> Past or to come; yea, boldly might I say, </l>
            <l n="7.573"> Ten summers and ten winters of a space </l>
            <l n="7.574"> That lies beyond life's ordinary bounds, </l>
            <l n="7.575"> Upon his sprightly vigour cannot fix </l>
            <l n="7.576"> The obligation of an anxious mind, </l>
            <l n="7.577"> A pride in having, or a fear to lose; </l>
            <l n="7.578"> Possessed like outskirts of some large domain, </l>
            <l n="7.579"> By any one more thought of than by him </l>
            <l n="7.580"> Who holds the land in fee, its careless lord! </l>
            <l n="7.581"> Yet is the creature rational, endowed </l>
            <l n="7.582"> With foresight; hears, too, every sabbath day, </l>
            <l n="7.583"> The christian promise with attentive ear; </l>
            <l n="7.584"> Nor will, I trust, the Majesty of Heaven </l>
            <l n="7.585"> Reject the incense offered up by him, </l>
            <l n="7.586"> Though of the kind which beasts and birds present </l>
            <l n="7.587"> In grove or pasture; cheerfulness of soul, </l>
            <l n="7.588"> From trepidation and repining free. </l>
            <l n="7.589"> How many scrupulous worshippers fall down </l>
            <l n="7.590"> Upon their knees, and daily homage pay </l>
            <l n="7.591"> Less worthy, less religious even, than his! </l>
            <l n="7.592">   This qualified respect, the old Man's due, </l>
            <l n="7.593"> Is paid without reluctance; but in truth,” </l>
            <l n="7.594"> (Said the good Vicar with a fond half-smile) </l>
            <l n="7.595"> “I feel at times a motion of despite </l>
            <l n="7.596"> Towards one, whose bold contrivances and skill, </l>
            <l n="7.597"> As you have seen, bear such conspicuous part </l>
            <l n="7.598"> In works of havoc; taking from these vales, </l>
            <l n="7.599"> One after one, their proudest ornaments. </l>
            <l n="7.600"> Full oft his doings leave me to deplore </l>
            <l n="7.601"> Tall ash-tree, sown by winds, by vapours nursed, </l>
            <l n="7.602"> In the dry crannies of the pendent rocks; </l>
            <l n="7.603"> Light birch, aloft upon the horizon's edge, </l>
            <l n="7.604"> A veil of glory for the ascending moon; </l>
            <l n="7.605"> And oak whose roots by noontide dew were damped, </l>
            <l n="7.606"> And on whose forehead inaccessible </l>
            <l n="7.607"> The raven lodged in safety.—Many a ship </l>
            <l n="7.608"> Launched into Morecamb-bay to 'him' hath owed </l>
            <l n="7.609"> Her strong knee-timbers, and the mast that bears </l>
            <l n="7.610"> The loftiest of her pendants; He, from park </l>
            <l n="7.611"> Or forest, fetched the enormous axle-tree </l>
            <l n="7.612"> That whirls (how slow itself!) ten thousand spindles: </l>
            <l n="7.613"> And the vast engine labouring in the mine, </l>
            <l n="7.614"> Content with meaner prowess, must have lacked </l>
            <l n="7.615"> The trunk and body of its marvellous strength, </l>
            <l n="7.616"> If his undaunted enterprise had failed </l>
            <l n="7.617"> Among the mountain coves. </l>
            <l n="7.618">                            Yon household fir, </l>
            <l n="7.619"> A guardian planted to fence off the blast, </l>
            <l n="7.620"> But towering high the roof above, as if </l>
            <l n="7.621"> Its humble destination were forgot— </l>
            <l n="7.622"> That sycamore, which annually holds </l>
            <l n="7.623"> Within its shade, as in a stately tent </l>
            <l n="7.624"> On all sides open to the fanning breeze, </l>
            <l n="7.625"> A grave assemblage, seated while they shear </l>
            <l n="7.626"> The fleece-encumbered flock—the JOYFUL ELM, </l>
            <l n="7.627"> Around whose trunk the maidens dance in May— </l>
            <l n="7.628"> And the LORD'S OAK—would plead their several rights </l>
            <l n="7.629"> In vain, if he were master of their fate; </l>
            <l n="7.630"> His sentence to the axe would doom them all. </l>
            <l n="7.631"> But, green in age and lusty as he is, </l>
            <l n="7.632"> And promising to keep his hold on earth </l>
            <l n="7.633"> Less, as might seem, in rivalship with men </l>
            <l n="7.634"> Than with the forest's more enduring growth, </l>
            <l n="7.635"> His own appointed hour will come at last; </l>
            <l n="7.636"> And, like the haughty Spoilers of the world, </l>
            <l n="7.637"> This keen Destroyer, in his turn, must fall. </l>
            <l n="7.638">   Now from the living pass we once again: </l>
            <l n="7.639"> From Age,” the Priest continued, “turn your thoughts; </l>
            <l n="7.640"> From Age, that often unlamented drops, </l>
            <l n="7.641"> And mark that daisied hillock, three spans long! </l>
            <l n="7.642"> —Seven lusty Sons sate daily round the board </l>
            <l n="7.643"> Of Gold-rill side; and, when the hope had ceased </l>
            <l n="7.644"> Of other progeny, a Daughter then </l>
            <l n="7.645"> Was given, the crowning bounty of the whole; </l>
            <l n="7.646"> And so acknowledged with a tremulous joy </l>
            <l n="7.647"> Felt to the centre of that heavenly calm </l>
            <l n="7.648"> With which by nature every mother's soul </l>
            <l n="7.649"> Is stricken in the moment when her throes </l>
            <l n="7.650"> Are ended, and her ears have heard the cry </l>
            <l n="7.651"> Which tells her that a living child is born; </l>
            <l n="7.652"> And she lies conscious, in a blissful rest, </l>
            <l n="7.653"> That the dread storm is weathered by them both. </l>
            <l n="7.654">   The Father—him at this unlooked-for gift </l>
            <l n="7.655"> A bolder transport seizes. From the side </l>
            <l n="7.656"> Of his bright hearth, and from his open door, </l>
            <l n="7.657"> Day after day the gladness is diffused </l>
            <l n="7.658"> To all that come, almost to all that pass; </l>
            <l n="7.659"> Invited, summoned, to partake the cheer </l>
            <l n="7.660"> Spread on the never-empty board, and drink </l>
            <l n="7.661"> Health and good wishes to his new-born girl, </l>
            <l n="7.662"> From cups replenished by his joyous hand. </l>
            <l n="7.663"> —Those seven fair brothers variously were moved </l>
            <l n="7.664"> Each by the thoughts best suited to his years: </l>
            <l n="7.665"> But most of all and with most thankful mind </l>
            <l n="7.666"> The hoary grandsire felt himself enriched; </l>
            <l n="7.667"> A happiness that ebbed not, but remained </l>
            <l n="7.668"> To fill the total measure of his soul! </l>
            <l n="7.669"> —From the low tenement, his own abode, </l>
            <l n="7.670"> Whither, as to a little private cell, </l>
            <l n="7.671"> He had withdrawn from bustle, care, and noise, </l>
            <l n="7.672"> To spend the sabbath of old age in peace, </l>
            <l n="7.673"> Once every day he duteously repaired </l>
            <l n="7.674"> To rock the cradle of the slumbering babe: </l>
            <l n="7.675"> For in that female infant's name he heard </l>
            <l n="7.676"> The silent name of his departed wife; </l>
            <l n="7.677"> Heart-stirring music! hourly heard that name; </l>
            <l n="7.678"> Full blest he was, 'Another Margaret Green,' </l>
            <l n="7.679"> Oft did he say, 'was come to Gold-rill side.' </l>
            <l n="7.680">   Oh! pang unthought of, as the precious boon </l>
            <l n="7.681"> Itself had been unlooked-for; oh! dire stroke </l>
            <l n="7.682"> Of desolating anguish for them all! </l>
            <l n="7.683"> —Just as the Child could totter on the floor, </l>
            <l n="7.684"> And, by some friendly finger's help up-stayed, </l>
            <l n="7.685"> Range round the garden walk, while she perchance </l>
            <l n="7.686"> Was catching at some novelty of spring, </l>
            <l n="7.687"> Ground-flower, or glossy insect from its cell </l>
            <l n="7.688"> Drawn by the sunshine—at that hopeful season </l>
            <l n="7.689"> The winds of March, smiting insidiously, </l>
            <l n="7.690"> Raised in the tender passage of the throat </l>
            <l n="7.691"> Viewless obstruction; whence, all unforewarned, </l>
            <l n="7.692"> The household lost their pride and soul's delight. </l>
            <l n="7.693"> —But time hath power to soften all regrets, </l>
            <l n="7.694"> And prayer and thought can bring to worst distress </l>
            <l n="7.695"> Due resignation. Therefore, though some tears </l>
            <l n="7.696"> Fail not to spring from either Parent's eye </l>
            <l n="7.697"> Oft as they hear of sorrow like their own, </l>
            <l n="7.698"> Yet this departed Little-one, too long </l>
            <l n="7.699"> The innocent troubler of their quiet, sleeps </l>
            <l n="7.700"> In what may now be called a peaceful bed. </l>
            <l n="7.701">   On a bright day—so calm and bright, it seemed </l>
            <l n="7.702"> To us, with our sad spirits, heavenly-fair— </l>
            <l n="7.703"> These mountains echoed to an unknown sound; </l>
            <l n="7.704"> A volley, thrice repeated o'er the Corse </l>
            <l n="7.705"> Let down into the hollow of that grave, </l>
            <l n="7.706"> Whose shelving sides are red with naked mould. </l>
            <l n="7.707"> Ye rains of April, duly wet this earth! </l>
            <l n="7.708"> Spare, burning sun of midsummer, these sods, </l>
            <l n="7.709"> That they may knit together, and therewith </l>
            <l n="7.710"> Our thoughts unite in kindred quietness! </l>
            <l n="7.711"> Nor so the Valley shall forget her loss. </l>
            <l n="7.712"> Dear Youth, by young and old alike beloved, </l>
            <l n="7.713"> To me as precious as my own!—Green herbs </l>
            <l n="7.714"> May creep (I wish that they would softly creep) </l>
            <l n="7.715"> Over thy last abode, and we may pass </l>
            <l n="7.716"> Reminded less imperiously of thee;— </l>
            <l n="7.717"> The ridge itself may sink into the breast </l>
            <l n="7.718"> Of earth, the great abyss, and be no more; </l>
            <l n="7.719"> Yet shall not thy remembrance leave our hearts, </l>
            <l n="7.720"> Thy image disappear! </l>
            <l n="7.721">                       The Mountain-ash </l>
            <l n="7.722"> No eye can overlook, when 'mid a grove </l>
            <l n="7.723"> Of yet unfaded trees she lifts her head </l>
            <l n="7.724"> Decked with autumnal berries, that outshine </l>
            <l n="7.725"> Spring's richest blossoms; and ye may have marked, </l>
            <l n="7.726"> By a brook-side or solitary tarn, </l>
            <l n="7.727"> How she her station doth adorn: the pool </l>
            <l n="7.728"> Glows at her feet, and all the gloomy rocks </l>
            <l n="7.729"> Are brightened round her. In his native vale </l>
            <l n="7.730"> Such and so glorious did this Youth appear; </l>
            <l n="7.731"> A sight that kindled pleasure in all hearts </l>
            <l n="7.732"> By his ingenuous beauty, by the gleam </l>
            <l n="7.733"> Of his fair eyes, by his capacious brow, </l>
            <l n="7.734"> By all the graces with which nature's hand </l>
            <l n="7.735"> Had lavishly arrayed him. As old bards </l>
            <l n="7.736"> Tell in their idle songs of wandering gods, </l>
            <l n="7.737"> Pan or Apollo, veiled in human form: </l>
            <l n="7.738"> Yet, like the sweet-breathed violet of the shade </l>
            <l n="7.739"> Discovered in their own despite to sense </l>
            <l n="7.740"> Of mortals (if such fables without blame </l>
            <l n="7.741"> May find chance-mention on this sacred ground) </l>
            <l n="7.742"> So, through a simple rustic garb's disguise, </l>
            <l n="7.743"> And through the impediment of rural cares, </l>
            <l n="7.744"> In him revealed a scholar's genius shone; </l>
            <l n="7.745"> And so, not wholly hidden from men's sight, </l>
            <l n="7.746"> In him the spirit of a hero walked </l>
            <l n="7.747"> Our unpretending valley.—How the quoit </l>
            <l n="7.748"> Whizzed from the Stripling's arm! If touched by him, </l>
            <l n="7.749"> The inglorious foot-ball mounted to the pitch </l>
            <l n="7.750"> Of the lark's flight,—or shaped a rainbow curve, </l>
            <l n="7.751"> Aloft, in prospect of the shouting field! </l>
            <l n="7.752"> The indefatigable fox had learned </l>
            <l n="7.753"> To dread his perseverance in the chase. </l>
            <l n="7.754"> With admiration would he lift his eyes </l>
            <l n="7.755"> To the wide-ruling eagle, and his hand </l>
            <l n="7.756"> Was loth to assault the majesty he loved: </l>
            <l n="7.757"> Else had the strongest fastnesses proved weak </l>
            <l n="7.758"> To guard the royal brood. The sailing glead, </l>
            <l n="7.759"> The wheeling swallow, and the darting snipe; </l>
            <l n="7.760"> The sportive sea-gull dancing with the waves, </l>
            <l n="7.761"> And cautious water-fowl, from distant climes, </l>
            <l n="7.762"> Fixed at their seat, the centre of the Mere; </l>
            <l n="7.763"> Were subject to young Oswald's steady aim, </l>
            <l n="7.764"> And lived by his forbearance. </l>
            <l n="7.765">                                From the coast </l>
            <l n="7.766"> Of France a boastful Tyrant hurled his threats; </l>
            <l n="7.767"> Our Country marked the preparation vast </l>
            <l n="7.768"> Of hostile forces; and she called—with voice </l>
            <l n="7.769"> That filled her plains, that reached her utmost shores, </l>
            <l n="7.770"> And in remotest vales was heard—to arms! </l>
            <l n="7.771"> —Then, for the first time, here you might have seen </l>
            <l n="7.772"> The shepherd's grey to martial scarlet changed, </l>
            <l n="7.773"> That flashed uncouthly through the woods and fields. </l>
            <l n="7.774"> Ten hardy Striplings, all in bright attire, </l>
            <l n="7.775"> And graced with shining weapons, weekly marched, </l>
            <l n="7.776"> From this lone valley, to a central spot </l>
            <l n="7.777"> Where, in assemblage with the flower and choice </l>
            <l n="7.778"> Of the surrounding district, they might learn </l>
            <l n="7.779"> The rudiments of war; ten—hardy, strong, </l>
            <l n="7.780"> And valiant; but young Oswald, like a chief </l>
            <l n="7.781"> And yet a modest comrade, led them forth </l>
            <l n="7.782"> From their shy solitude, to face the world, </l>
            <l n="7.783"> With a gay confidence and seemly pride; </l>
            <l n="7.784"> Measuring the soil beneath their happy feet </l>
            <l n="7.785"> Like Youths released from labour, and yet bound </l>
            <l n="7.786"> To most laborious service, though to them </l>
            <l n="7.787"> A festival of unencumbered ease; </l>
            <l n="7.788"> The inner spirit keeping holiday, </l>
            <l n="7.789"> Like vernal ground to sabbath sunshine left. </l>
            <l n="7.790">   Oft have I marked him, at some leisure hour, </l>
            <l n="7.791"> Stretched on the grass, or seated in the shade, </l>
            <l n="7.792"> Among his fellows, while an ample map </l>
            <l n="7.793"> Before their eyes lay carefully outspread, </l>
            <l n="7.794"> From which the gallant teacher would discourse, </l>
            <l n="7.795"> Now pointing this way, and now that.—'Here flows,' </l>
            <l n="7.796"> Thus would he say, 'the Rhine, that famous stream! </l>
            <l n="7.797"> 'Eastward, the Danube toward this inland sea, </l>

            <l n="7.803"> Of livelier interest to his hopes and fears, </l>
            <l n="7.804"> His finger moved, distinguishing the spots </l>
            <l n="7.805"> Where wide-spread conflict then most fiercely raged; </l>
            <l n="7.806"> Nor left unstigmatized those fatal fields </l>
            <l n="7.807"> On which the sons of mighty Germany </l>
            <l n="7.808"> Were taught a base submission.—'Here behold </l>

            <l n="7.812"> —And, surely, he, that spake with kindling brow, </l>
            <l n="7.813"> Was a true patriot, hopeful as the best </l>
            <l n="7.814"> Of that young peasantry, who, in our days, </l>
            <l n="7.815"> Have fought and perished for Helvetia's rights— </l>
            <l n="7.816"> Ah, not in vain!—or those who, in old time, </l>
            <l n="7.817"> For work of happier issue, to the side </l>
            <l n="7.818"> Of Tell came trooping from a thousand huts, </l>
            <l n="7.819"> When he had risen alone! No braver Youth </l>
            <l n="7.820"> Descended from Judean heights, to march </l>
            <l n="7.821"> With righteous Joshua; nor appeared in arms </l>
            <l n="7.822"> When grove was felled, and altar was cast down, </l>
            <l n="7.823"> And Gideon blew the trumpet, soul-inflamed, </l>
            <l n="7.824"> And strong in hatred of idolatry.” </l>
            <l n="7.825">   The Pastor, even as if by these last words </l>
            <l n="7.826"> Raised from his seat within the chosen shade, </l>
            <l n="7.827"> Moved toward the grave;—instinctively his steps </l>
            <l n="7.828"> We followed; and my voice with joy exclaimed: </l>
            <l n="7.829"> “Power to the Oppressors of the world is given, </l>
            <l n="7.830"> A might of which they dream not. Oh! the curse, </l>
            <l n="7.831"> To be the awakener of divinest thoughts, </l>
            <l n="7.832"> Father and founder of exalted deeds; </l>
            <l n="7.833"> And, to whole nations bound in servile straits, </l>
            <l n="7.834"> The liberal donor of capacities </l>
            <l n="7.835"> More than heroic! this to be, nor yet </l>
            <l n="7.836"> Have sense of one connatural wish, nor yet </l>
            <l n="7.837"> Deserve the least return of human thanks; </l>
            <l n="7.838"> Winning no recompense but deadly hate </l>
            <l n="7.839"> With pity mixed, astonishment with scorn!” </l>
            <l n="7.840">   When this involuntary strain had ceased, </l>
            <l n="7.841"> The Pastor said: “So Providence is served; </l>
            <l n="7.842"> The forked weapon of the skies can send </l>
            <l n="7.843"> Illumination into deep, dark holds, </l>
            <l n="7.844"> Which the mild sunbeam hath not power to pierce. </l>
            <l n="7.845"> Ye Thrones that have defied remorse, and cast </l>
            <l n="7.846"> Pity away, soon shall ye quake with 'fear'! </l>
            <l n="7.847"> For, not unconscious of the mighty debt </l>
            <l n="7.848"> Which to outrageous wrong the sufferer owes, </l>
            <l n="7.849"> Europe, through all her habitable bounds, </l>
            <l n="7.850"> Is thirsting for 'their' overthrow, who yet </l>
            <l n="7.851"> Survive, as pagan temples stood of yore, </l>
            <l n="7.852"> By horror of their impious rites, preserved; </l>
            <l n="7.853"> Are still permitted to extend their pride, </l>
            <l n="7.854"> Like cedars on the top of Lebanon </l>
            <l n="7.855"> Darkening the sun. </l>
            <l n="7.856">                     But less impatient thoughts, </l>
            <l n="7.857"> And love 'all hoping and expecting all,' </l>
            <l n="7.858"> This hallowed grave demands, where rests in peace </l>
            <l n="7.859"> A humble champion of the better cause, </l>
            <l n="7.860"> A Peasant-youth, so call him, for he asked </l>
            <l n="7.861"> No higher name; in whom our country showed, </l>
            <l n="7.862"> As in a favourite son, most beautiful. </l>
            <l n="7.863"> In spite of vice, and misery, and disease, </l>
            <l n="7.864"> Spread with the spreading of her wealthy arts, </l>
            <l n="7.865"> England, the ancient and the free, appeared </l>
            <l n="7.866"> In him to stand before my swimming eyes, </l>
            <l n="7.867"> Unconquerably virtuous and secure. </l>
            <l n="7.868"> —No more of this, lest I offend his dust: </l>
            <l n="7.869"> Short was his life, and a brief tale remains. </l>
            <l n="7.870">   One day—a summer's day of annual pomp </l>
            <l n="7.871"> And solemn chase—from morn to sultry noon </l>
            <l n="7.872"> His steps had followed, fleetest of the fleet, </l>
            <l n="7.873"> The red-deer driven along its native heights </l>
            <l n="7.874"> With cry of hound and horn; and, from that toil </l>
            <l n="7.875"> Returned with sinews weakened and relaxed, </l>
            <l n="7.876"> This generous Youth, too negligent of self, </l>
            <l n="7.877"> Plunged—'mid a gay and busy throng convened </l>
            <l n="7.878"> To wash the fleeces of his Father's flock— </l>
            <l n="7.879"> Into the chilling flood. Convulsions dire </l>
            <l n="7.880"> Seized him, that self-same night; and through the space </l>
            <l n="7.881"> Of twelve ensuing days his frame was wrenched, </l>
            <l n="7.882"> Till nature rested from her work in death. </l>
            <l n="7.883"> To him, thus snatched away, his comrades paid </l>
            <l n="7.884"> A soldier's honours. At his funeral hour </l>
            <l n="7.885"> Bright was the sun, the sky a cloudless blue— </l>
            <l n="7.886"> A golden lustre slept upon the hills; </l>
            <l n="7.887"> And if by chance a stranger, wandering there, </l>
            <l n="7.888"> From some commanding eminence had looked </l>
            <l n="7.889"> Down on this spot, well pleased would he have seen </l>
            <l n="7.890"> A glittering spectacle; but every face </l>
            <l n="7.891"> Was pallid: seldom hath that eye been moist </l>
            <l n="7.892"> With tears, that wept not then; nor were the few, </l>
            <l n="7.893"> Who from their dwellings came not forth to join </l>
            <l n="7.894"> In this sad service, less disturbed than we. </l>
            <l n="7.895"> They started at the tributary peal </l>
            <l n="7.896"> Of instantaneous thunder, which announced, </l>
            <l n="7.897"> Through the still air, the closing of the Grave; </l>
            <l n="7.898"> And distant mountains echoed with a sound </l>
            <l n="7.899"> Of lamentation, never heard before!” </l>
            <l n="7.900">   The Pastor ceased.—My venerable Friend </l>
            <l n="7.901"> Victoriously upraised his clear bright eye; </l>
            <l n="7.902"> And, when that eulogy was ended, stood </l>
            <l n="7.903"> Enrapt, as if his inward sense perceived </l>
            <l n="7.904"> The prolongation of some still response, </l>
            <l n="7.905"> Sent by the ancient Soul of this wide land, </l>
            <l n="7.906"> The Spirit of its mountains and its seas, </l>
            <l n="7.907"> Its cities, temples, fields, its awful power, </l>
            <l n="7.908"> Its rights and virtues—by that Deity </l>
            <l n="7.909"> Descending, and supporting his pure heart </l>
            <l n="7.910"> With patriotic confidence and joy. </l>
            <l n="7.911"> And, at the last of those memorial words, </l>
            <l n="7.912"> The pining Solitary turned aside; </l>
            <l n="7.913"> Whether through manly instinct to conceal </l>
            <l n="7.914"> Tender emotions spreading from the heart </l>
            <l n="7.915"> To his worn cheek; or with uneasy shame </l>
            <l n="7.916"> For those cold humours of habitual spleen </l>
            <l n="7.917"> That, fondly seeking in dispraise of man </l>
            <l n="7.918"> Solace and self-excuse, had sometimes urged </l>
            <l n="7.919"> To self-abuse a not ineloquent tongue. </l>
            <l n="7.920"> —Right toward the sacred Edifice his steps </l>
            <l n="7.921"> Had been directed; and we saw him now </l>
            <l n="7.922"> Intent upon a monumental stone, </l>
            <l n="7.923"> Whose uncouth form was grafted on the wall, </l>
            <l n="7.924"> Or rather seemed to have grown into the side </l>
            <l n="7.925"> Of the rude pile; as oft-times trunks of trees, </l>
            <l n="7.926"> Where nature works in wild and craggy spots, </l>
            <l n="7.927"> Are seen incorporate with the living rock— </l>
            <l n="7.928"> To endure for aye. The Vicar, taking note </l>
            <l n="7.929"> Of his employment, with a courteous smile </l>
            <l n="7.930"> Exclaimed— </l>

            <l n="7.932"> That task would foil;” then, letting fall his voice </l>
            <l n="7.933"> While he advanced, thus spake: “Tradition tells </l>
            <l n="7.934"> That, in Eliza's golden days, a Knight </l>
            <l n="7.935"> Came on a war-horse sumptuously attired, </l>
            <l n="7.936"> And fixed his home in this sequestered vale. </l>
            <l n="7.937"> 'Tis left untold if here he first drew breath, </l>
            <l n="7.938"> Or as a stranger reached this deep recess, </l>
            <l n="7.939"> Unknowing and unknown. A pleasing thought </l>
            <l n="7.940"> I sometimes entertain, that haply bound </l>
            <l n="7.941"> To Scotland's court in service of his Queen, </l>
            <l n="7.942"> Or sent on mission to some northern Chief </l>
            <l n="7.943"> Of England's realm, this vale he might have seen </l>
            <l n="7.944"> With transient observation; and thence caught </l>
            <l n="7.945"> An image fair, which, brightening in his soul </l>
            <l n="7.946"> When joy of war and pride of chivalry </l>
            <l n="7.947"> Languished beneath accumulated years, </l>
            <l n="7.948"> Had power to draw him from the world, resolved </l>
            <l n="7.949"> To make that paradise his chosen home </l>
            <l n="7.950"> To which his peaceful fancy oft had turned. </l>
            <l n="7.951">   Vague thoughts are these; but, if belief may rest </l>
            <l n="7.952"> Upon unwritten story fondly traced </l>
            <l n="7.953"> From sire to son, in this obscure retreat </l>
            <l n="7.954"> The Knight arrived, with spear and shield, and borne </l>
            <l n="7.955"> Upon a Charger gorgeously bedecked </l>
            <l n="7.956"> With broidered housings. And the lofty Steed— </l>
            <l n="7.957"> His sole companion, and his faithful friend, </l>
            <l n="7.958"> Whom he, in gratitude, let loose to range </l>
            <l n="7.959"> In fertile pastures—was beheld with eyes </l>
            <l n="7.960"> Of admiration and delightful awe, </l>
            <l n="7.961"> By those untravelled Dalesmen. With less pride, </l>
            <l n="7.962"> Yet free from touch of envious discontent, </l>
            <l n="7.963"> They saw a mansion at his bidding rise, </l>
            <l n="7.964"> Like a bright star, amid the lowly band </l>
            <l n="7.965"> Of their rude homesteads. Here the Warrior dwelt; </l>
            <l n="7.966"> And, in that mansion children of his own, </l>
            <l n="7.967"> Or kindred, gathered round him. As a tree </l>
            <l n="7.968"> That falls and disappears, the house is gone; </l>
            <l n="7.969"> And, through improvidence or want of love </l>
            <l n="7.970"> For ancient worth and honourable things, </l>
            <l n="7.971"> The spear and shield are vanished, which the Knight </l>
            <l n="7.972"> Hung in his rustic hall. One ivied arch </l>

            <l n="7.974"> Of that foundation in domestic care </l>
            <l n="7.975"> Raised by his hands. And now no trace is left </l>
            <l n="7.976"> Of the mild-hearted Champion, save this stone, </l>
            <l n="7.977"> Faithless memorial! and his family name </l>
            <l n="7.978"> Borne by yon clustering cottages, that sprang </l>
            <l n="7.979"> From out the ruins of his stately lodge: </l>
            <l n="7.980"> These, and the name and title at full length,— </l>
            <l n="7.981"> 'Sir Alfred Irthing', with appropriate words </l>
            <l n="7.982"> Accompanied, still extant, in a wreath </l>
            <l n="7.983"> Or posy, girding round the several fronts </l>
            <l n="7.984"> Of three clear-sounding and harmonious bells, </l>
            <l n="7.985"> That in the steeple hang, his pious gift.” </l>
            <l n="7.986">   “So fails, so languishes, grows dim, and dies,” </l>
            <l n="7.987"> The grey-haired Wanderer pensively exclaimed, </l>
            <l n="7.988"> “All that this world is proud of. From their spheres </l>
            <l n="7.989"> The stars of human glory are cast down; </l>
            <l n="7.990"> Perish the roses and the flowers of kings, </l>
            <l n="7.991"> Princes, and emperors, and the crowns and palms </l>
            <l n="7.992"> Of all the mighty, withered and consumed! </l>
            <l n="7.993"> Nor is power given to lowliest innocence </l>
            <l n="7.994"> Long to protect her own. The man himself </l>
            <l n="7.995"> Departs; and soon is spent the line of those </l>
            <l n="7.996"> Who, in the bodily image, in the mind, </l>
            <l n="7.997"> In heart or soul, in station or pursuit, </l>
            <l n="7.998"> Did most resemble him. Degrees and ranks, </l>
            <l n="7.999"> Fraternities and orders—heaping high </l>
            <l n="7.1000"> New wealth upon the burthen of the old, </l>
            <l n="7.1001"> And placing trust in privilege confirmed </l>
            <l n="7.1002"> And re-confirmed—are scoffed at with a smile </l>
            <l n="7.1003"> Of greedy foretaste, from the secret stand </l>
            <l n="7.1004"> Of Desolation, aimed: to slow decline </l>
            <l n="7.1005"> These yield, and these to sudden overthrow: </l>
            <l n="7.1006"> Their virtue, service, happiness, and state </l>
            <l n="7.1007"> Expire; and nature's pleasant robe of green, </l>
            <l n="7.1008"> Humanity's appointed shroud, enwraps </l>
            <l n="7.1009"> Their monuments and their memory. The vast Frame </l>
            <l n="7.1010"> Of social nature changes evermore </l>
            <l n="7.1011"> Her organs and her members, with decay </l>
            <l n="7.1012"> Restless, and restless generation, powers </l>
            <l n="7.1013"> And functions dying and produced at need,— </l>
            <l n="7.1014"> And by this law the mighty whole subsists: </l>
            <l n="7.1015"> With an ascent and progress in the main; </l>
            <l n="7.1016"> Yet, oh! how disproportioned to the hopes </l>
            <l n="7.1017"> And expectations of self-flattering minds! </l>
            <l n="7.1018">   The courteous Knight, whose bones are here interred, </l>
            <l n="7.1019"> Lived in an age conspicuous as our own </l>
            <l n="7.1020"> For strife and ferment in the minds of men; </l>
            <l n="7.1021"> Whence alteration in the forms of things, </l>
            <l n="7.1022"> Various and vast. A memorable age! </l>
            <l n="7.1023"> Which did to him assign a pensive lot— </l>
            <l n="7.1024"> To linger 'mid the last of those bright clouds </l>
            <l n="7.1025"> That, on the steady breeze of honour, sailed </l>
            <l n="7.1026"> In long procession calm and beautiful. </l>
            <l n="7.1027"> He who had seen his own bright order fade, </l>
            <l n="7.1028"> And its devotion gradually decline, </l>
            <l n="7.1029"> (While war, relinquishing the lance and shield, </l>
            <l n="7.1030"> Her temper changed, and bowed to other laws) </l>
            <l n="7.1031"> Had also witnessed, in his morn of life, </l>
            <l n="7.1032"> That violent commotion, which o'erthrew, </l>
            <l n="7.1033"> In town and city and sequestered glen, </l>
            <l n="7.1034"> Altar, and cross, and church of solemn roof, </l>
            <l n="7.1035"> And old religious house—pile after pile; </l>
            <l n="7.1036"> And shook their tenants out into the fields, </l>
            <l n="7.1037"> Like wild beasts without home! Their hour was come; </l>
            <l n="7.1038"> But why no softening thought of gratitude, </l>
            <l n="7.1039"> No just remembrance, scruple, or wise doubt? </l>
            <l n="7.1040"> Benevolence is mild; nor borrows help, </l>
            <l n="7.1041"> Save at worst need, from bold impetuous force, </l>
            <l n="7.1042"> Fitliest allied to anger and revenge. </l>
            <l n="7.1043"> But Human-kind rejoices in the might </l>
            <l n="7.1044"> Of mutability; and airy hopes, </l>
            <l n="7.1045"> Dancing around her, hinder and disturb </l>
            <l n="7.1046"> Those meditations of the soul that feed </l>
            <l n="7.1047"> The retrospective virtues. Festive songs </l>
            <l n="7.1048"> Break from the maddened nations at the sight </l>
            <l n="7.1049"> Of sudden overthrow; and cold neglect </l>
            <l n="7.1050"> Is the sure consequence of slow decay. </l>
            <l n="7.1051">   Even,” said the Wanderer, “as that courteous Knight, </l>
            <l n="7.1052"> Bound by his vow to labour for redress </l>
            <l n="7.1053"> Of all who suffer wrong, and to enact </l>
            <l n="7.1054"> By sword and lance the law of gentleness, </l>
            <l n="7.1055"> (If I may venture of myself to speak, </l>

            <l n="7.1057"> Low things with lofty) I too shall be doomed </l>
            <l n="7.1058"> To outlive the kindly use and fair esteem </l>
            <l n="7.1059"> Of the poor calling which my youth embraced </l>
            <l n="7.1060"> With no unworthy prospect. But enough; </l>

            <l n="7.1062"> To stop, and yield our gracious Teacher thanks </l>
            <l n="7.1063"> For the pathetic records which his voice </l>

            <l n="7.1065"> Tending to patience when affliction strikes; </l>
            <l n="7.1066"> To hope and love; to confident repose </l>
            <l n="7.1067"> In God; and reverence for the dust of Man.” </l>

            <p>Pastor's apology and apprehensions that he might have detained 
his Auditors too long, with the Pastor's invitation to his house— 
Solitary disinclined to comply—Rallies the Wanderer—And 
playfully draws a comparison between his itinerant profession and 
that of the Knight-errant—Which leads to Wanderer's giving an 
account of changes in the Country from the manufacturing spirit— 
Favourable effects—The other side of the picture, and chiefly as 
it has affected the humbler classes—Wanderer asserts the 
hollowness of all national grandeur if unsupported by moral 
worth—Physical science unable to support itself—Lamentations 
over an excess of manufacturing industry among the humbler Classes 
of Society—Picture of a Child employed in a Cotton-mill— 
Ignorance and degradation of Children among the agricultural 
Population reviewed—Conversation broken off by a renewed 
Invitation from the Pastor—Path leading to his House—Its 
appearance described—His Daughter—His Wife—His Son (a Boy) 
enters with his Companion—Their happy appearance—The Wanderer 
how affected by the sight of them.

            <l n="8.1"> THE pensive Sceptic of the lonely vale </l>
            <l n="8.2"> To those acknowledgments subscribed his own, </l>
            <l n="8.3"> With a sedate compliance, which the Priest </l>
            <l n="8.4"> Failed not to notice, inly pleased, and said:— </l>
            <l n="8.5"> “If ye, by whom invited I began </l>
            <l n="8.6"> These narratives of calm and humble life, </l>
            <l n="8.7"> Be satisfied, 'tis well,—the end is gained; </l>
            <l n="8.8"> And, in return for sympathy bestowed </l>
            <l n="8.9"> And patient listening, thanks accept from me. </l>
            <l n="8.10"> —Life, death, eternity! momentous themes </l>
            <l n="8.11"> Are they—and might demand a seraph's tongue, </l>
            <l n="8.12"> Were they not equal to their own support; </l>
            <l n="8.13"> And therefore no incompetence of mine </l>
            <l n="8.14"> Could do them wrong. The universal forms </l>
            <l n="8.15"> Of human nature, in a spot like this, </l>
            <l n="8.16"> Present themselves at once to all men's view: </l>
            <l n="8.17"> Ye wished for act and circumstance, that make </l>
            <l n="8.18"> The individual known and understood; </l>
            <l n="8.19"> And such as my best judgment could select </l>
            <l n="8.20"> From what the place afforded, have been given; </l>
            <l n="8.21"> Though apprehensions crossed me that my zeal </l>
            <l n="8.22"> To his might well be likened, who unlocks </l>
            <l n="8.23"> A cabinet stored with gems and pictures—draws </l>
            <l n="8.24"> His treasures forth, soliciting regard </l>
            <l n="8.25"> To this, and this, as worthier than the last, </l>
            <l n="8.26"> Till the spectator, who awhile was pleased </l>
            <l n="8.27"> More than the exhibitor himself, becomes </l>
            <l n="8.28"> Weary and faint, and longs to be released. </l>
            <l n="8.29"> —But let us hence! my dwelling is in sight, </l>

            <l n="8.31">               At this the Solitary shrunk </l>
            <l n="8.32"> With backward will; but, wanting not address </l>
            <l n="8.33"> That inward motion to disguise, he said </l>
            <l n="8.34"> To his Compatriot, smiling as he spake; </l>
            <l n="8.35"> —“The peaceable remains of this good Knight </l>
            <l n="8.36"> Would be disturbed, I fear, with wrathful scorn, </l>
            <l n="8.37"> If consciousness could reach him where he lies </l>
            <l n="8.38"> That one, albeit of these degenerate times, </l>
            <l n="8.39"> Deploring changes past, or dreading change </l>
            <l n="8.40"> Foreseen, had dared to couple, even in thought, </l>
            <l n="8.41"> The fine vocation of the sword and lance </l>
            <l n="8.42"> With the gross aims and body-bending toil </l>
            <l n="8.43"> Of a poor brotherhood who walk the earth </l>
            <l n="8.44"> Pitied, and, where they are not known, despised. </l>
            <l n="8.45">   Yet, by the good Knight's leave, the two estates </l>
            <l n="8.46"> Are graced with some resemblance. Errant those, </l>
            <l n="8.47"> Exiles and wanderers—and the like are these; </l>
            <l n="8.48"> Who, with their burthen, traverse hill and dale, </l>
            <l n="8.49"> Carrying relief for nature's simple wants. </l>
            <l n="8.50"> —What though no higher recompense be sought </l>
            <l n="8.51"> Than honest maintenance, by irksome toil </l>
            <l n="8.52"> Full oft procured, yet may they claim respect, </l>
            <l n="8.53"> Among the intelligent, for what this course </l>
            <l n="8.54"> Enables them to be and to perform. </l>
            <l n="8.55"> Their tardy steps give leisure to observe, </l>
            <l n="8.56"> While solitude permits the mind to feel; </l>
            <l n="8.57"> Instructs, and prompts her to supply defects </l>
            <l n="8.58"> By the division of her inward self </l>
            <l n="8.59"> For grateful converse: and to these poor men </l>
            <l n="8.60"> Nature (I but repeat your favourite boast) </l>
            <l n="8.61"> Is bountiful—go wheresoe'er they may; </l>
            <l n="8.62"> Kind nature's various wealth is all their own. </l>
            <l n="8.63"> Versed in the characters of men; and bound, </l>
            <l n="8.64"> By ties of daily interest, to maintain </l>
            <l n="8.65"> Conciliatory manners and smooth speech; </l>
            <l n="8.66"> Such have been, and still are in their degree, </l>
            <l n="8.67"> Examples efficacious to refine </l>
            <l n="8.68"> Rude intercourse; apt agents to expel, </l>
            <l n="8.69"> By importation of unlooked-for arts, </l>
            <l n="8.70"> Barbarian torpor, and blind prejudice; </l>
            <l n="8.71"> Raising, through just gradation, savage life </l>
            <l n="8.72"> To rustic, and the rustic to urbane. </l>
            <l n="8.73"> —Within their moving magazines is lodged </l>
            <l n="8.74"> Power that comes forth to quicken and exalt </l>
            <l n="8.75"> Affections seated in the mother's breast, </l>
            <l n="8.76"> And in the lover's fancy; and to feed </l>
            <l n="8.77"> The sober sympathies of long-tried friends. </l>
            <l n="8.78"> —By these Itinerants, as experienced men, </l>
            <l n="8.79"> Counsel is given; contention they appease </l>
            <l n="8.80"> With gentle language, in remotest wilds, </l>
            <l n="8.81"> Tears wipe away, and pleasant tidings bring; </l>
            <l n="8.82"> Could the proud quest of chivalry do more?” </l>
            <l n="8.83">   “Happy,” rejoined the Wanderer, “they who gain </l>
            <l n="8.84"> A panegyric from your generous tongue! </l>
            <l n="8.85"> But, if to these Wayfarers once pertained </l>
            <l n="8.86"> Aught of romantic interest, it is gone. </l>
            <l n="8.87"> Their purer service, in this realm at least, </l>
            <l n="8.88"> Is past for ever.—An inventive Age </l>
            <l n="8.89"> Has wrought, if not with speed of magic, yet </l>
            <l n="8.90"> To most strange issues. I have lived to mark </l>
            <l n="8.91"> A new and unforeseen creation rise </l>
            <l n="8.92"> From out the labours of a peaceful Land </l>
            <l n="8.93"> Wielding her potent enginery to frame </l>
            <l n="8.94"> And to produce, with appetite as keen </l>
            <l n="8.95"> As that of war, which rests not night or day, </l>
            <l n="8.96"> Industrious to destroy! With fruitless pains </l>
            <l n="8.97"> Might one like me 'now' visit many a tract </l>
            <l n="8.98"> Which, in his youth, he trod, and trod again, </l>
            <l n="8.99"> A lone pedestrian with a scanty freight, </l>
            <l n="8.100"> Wished-for, or welcome, wheresoe'er he came— </l>
            <l n="8.101"> Among the tenantry of thorpe and vill; </l>
            <l n="8.102"> Or straggling burgh, of ancient charter proud, </l>
            <l n="8.103"> And dignified by battlements and towers </l>
            <l n="8.104"> Of some stern castle, mouldering on the brow </l>
            <l n="8.105"> Of a green hill or bank of rugged stream. </l>
            <l n="8.106"> The foot-path faintly marked, the horse-track wild, </l>
            <l n="8.107"> And formidable length of plashy lane, </l>
            <l n="8.108"> (Prized avenues ere others had been shaped </l>
            <l n="8.109"> Or easier links connecting place with place) </l>
            <l n="8.110"> Have vanished—swallowed up by stately roads </l>
            <l n="8.111"> Easy and bold, that penetrate the gloom </l>
            <l n="8.112"> Of Britain's farthest glens. The Earth has lent </l>
            <l n="8.113"> Her waters, Air her breezes; and the sail </l>
            <l n="8.114"> Of traffic glides with ceaseless intercourse, </l>
            <l n="8.115"> Glistening along the low and woody dale; </l>
            <l n="8.116"> Or, in its progress, on the lofty side, </l>
            <l n="8.117"> Of some bare hill, with wonder kenned from far. </l>
            <l n="8.118">   Meanwhile, at social Industry's command, </l>
            <l n="8.119"> How quick, how vast an increase! From the germ </l>
            <l n="8.120"> Of some poor hamlet, rapidly produced </l>
            <l n="8.121"> Here a huge town, continuous and compact, </l>
            <l n="8.122"> Hiding the face of earth for leagues—and there, </l>
            <l n="8.123"> Where not a habitation stood before, </l>
            <l n="8.124"> Abodes of men irregularly massed </l>
            <l n="8.125"> Like trees in forests,—spread through spacious tracts, </l>
            <l n="8.126"> O'er which the smoke of unremitting fires </l>
            <l n="8.127"> Hangs permanent, and plentiful as wreaths </l>
            <l n="8.128"> Of vapour glittering in the morning sun. </l>
            <l n="8.129"> And, wheresoe'er the traveller turns his steps, </l>
            <l n="8.130"> He sees the barren wilderness erased, </l>
            <l n="8.131"> Or disappearing; triumph that proclaims </l>
            <l n="8.132"> How much the mild Directress of the plough </l>
            <l n="8.133"> Owes to alliance with these new-born arts! </l>

            <l n="8.149">   And yet, O happy Pastor of a flock </l>
            <l n="8.150"> Faithfully watched, and, by that loving care </l>

            <l n="8.165"> Of all-beholding Man, earth's thoughtful lord; </l>

            <l n="8.172"> Of harsher import than the curfew-knoll </l>
            <l n="8.173"> That spake the Norman Conqueror's stern behest— </l>
            <l n="8.174"> A local summons to unceasing toil! </l>
            <l n="8.175"> Disgorged are now the ministers of day; </l>

            <l n="8.179"> That turns the multitude of dizzy wheels, </l>
            <l n="8.180"> Glares, like a troubled spirit, in its bed </l>

            <l n="8.203"> O'er the blind elements; a purpose given, </l>
            <l n="8.204"> A perseverance fed; almost a soul </l>
            <l n="8.205"> Imparted—to brute matter. I rejoice, </l>
            <l n="8.206"> Measuring the force of those gigantic powers </l>
            <l n="8.207"> That, by the thinking mind, have been compelled </l>
            <l n="8.208"> To serve the will of feeble-bodied Man. </l>

            <l n="8.219"> Palmyra, central in the desert, fell; </l>
            <l n="8.220"> And the Arts died by which they had been raised. </l>

            <l n="8.232">   When from the Wanderer's lips these words had fallen, </l>
            <l n="8.233"> I said, “And, did in truth those vaunted Arts </l>

            <l n="8.243"> And pure good-will, and hospitable cheer; </l>
            <l n="8.244"> That made the very thought of country-life </l>

            <l n="8.253">   “Fled!” was the Wanderer's passionate response, </l>

            <l n="8.269"> To rock the cradle of her peevish babe; </l>
            <l n="8.270"> No daughters round her, busy at the wheel, </l>
            <l n="8.271"> Or in dispatch of each day's little growth </l>
            <l n="8.272"> Of household occupation; no nice arts </l>
            <l n="8.273"> Of needle-work; no bustle at the fire, </l>

            <l n="8.279"> No longer led or followed by the Sons; </l>
            <l n="8.280"> Idlers perchance they were,—but in 'his' sight; </l>
            <l n="8.281"> Breathing fresh air, and treading the green earth: </l>
            <l n="8.282"> 'Till their short holiday of childhood ceased, </l>
            <l n="8.283"> Ne'er to return! That birthright now is lost. </l>
            <l n="8.284"> Economists will tell you that the State </l>
            <l n="8.285"> Thrives by the forfeiture—unfeeling thought, </l>

            <l n="8.290"> The reason, famishes the heart, shuts up </l>
            <l n="8.291"> The infant Being in itself, and makes </l>
            <l n="8.292"> Its very spring a season of decay! </l>
            <l n="8.293"> The lot is wretched, the condition sad, </l>
            <l n="8.294"> Whether a pining discontent survive, </l>
            <l n="8.295"> And thirst for change; or habit hath subdued </l>

            <l n="8.307"> Quiet and calm. Behold him—in the school </l>
            <l n="8.308"> Of his attainments? no; but with the air </l>
            <l n="8.309"> Fanning his temples under heaven's blue arch. </l>
            <l n="8.310"> His raiment, whitened o'er with cotton-flakes </l>

            <l n="8.316"> Mantle upon his cheek. Is this the form, </l>
            <l n="8.317"> Is that the countenance, and such the port, </l>
            <l n="8.318"> Of no mean Being? One who should be clothed </l>
            <l n="8.319"> With dignity befitting his proud hope; </l>
            <l n="8.320"> Who, in his very childhood, should appear </l>
            <l n="8.321"> Sublime from present purity and joy! </l>
            <l n="8.322"> The limbs increase; but liberty of mind </l>
            <l n="8.323"> Is gone for ever; and this organic frame, </l>
            <l n="8.324"> So joyful in its motions, is become </l>
            <l n="8.325"> Dull, to the joy of her own motions dead; </l>
            <l n="8.326"> And even the touch, so exquisitely poured </l>
            <l n="8.327"> Through the whole body, with a languid will </l>
            <l n="8.328"> Performs its functions; rarely competent </l>
            <l n="8.329"> To impress a vivid feeling on the mind </l>
            <l n="8.330"> Of what there is delightful in the breeze, </l>
            <l n="8.331"> The gentle visitations of the sun, </l>
            <l n="8.332"> Or lapse of liquid element—by hand, </l>

            <l n="8.358"> Some nourishment, as trees do by their roots, </l>
            <l n="8.359"> From earth, the common mother of us all. </l>
            <l n="8.360"> Figure and mien, complexion and attire, </l>
            <l n="8.361"> Are leagued to strike dismay; but outstretched hand </l>
            <l n="8.362"> And whining voice denote them supplicants </l>
            <l n="8.363"> For the least boon that pity can bestow. </l>
            <l n="8.364"> Such on the breast of darksome heaths are found; </l>
            <l n="8.365"> And with their parents occupy the skirts </l>
            <l n="8.366"> Of furze-clad commons; such are born and reared </l>
            <l n="8.367"> At the mine's mouth under impending rocks; </l>
            <l n="8.368"> Or dwell in chambers of some natural cave; </l>
            <l n="8.369"> Or where their ancestors erected huts, </l>
            <l n="8.370"> For the convenience of unlawful gain, </l>
            <l n="8.371"> In forest purlieus; and the like are bred, </l>
            <l n="8.372"> All England through, where nooks and slips of ground </l>
            <l n="8.373"> Purloined, in times less jealous than our own, </l>
            <l n="8.374"> From the green margin of the public way, </l>
            <l n="8.375"> A residence afford them, 'mid the bloom </l>
            <l n="8.376"> And gaiety of cultivated fields. </l>
            <l n="8.377"> Such (we will hope the lowest in the scale) </l>
            <l n="8.378"> Do I remember oft-times to have seen </l>
            <l n="8.379"> 'Mid Buxton's dreary heights. In earnest watch, </l>
            <l n="8.380"> Till the swift vehicle approach, they stand; </l>
            <l n="8.381"> Then, following closely with the cloud of dust, </l>
            <l n="8.382"> An uncouth feat exhibit, and are gone </l>
            <l n="8.383"> Heels over head, like tumblers on a stage. </l>
            <l n="8.384"> —Up from the ground they snatch the copper coin, </l>
            <l n="8.385"> And, on the freight of merry passengers </l>
            <l n="8.386"> Fixing a steady eye, maintain their speed; </l>
            <l n="8.387"> And spin—and pant—and overhead again, </l>
            <l n="8.388"> Wild pursuivants! until their breath is lost, </l>
            <l n="8.389"> Or bounty tires—and every face, that smiled </l>
            <l n="8.390"> Encouragement, hath ceased to look that way. </l>
            <l n="8.391"> —But, like the vagrants of the gipsy tribe, </l>
            <l n="8.392"> These, bred to little pleasure in themselves, </l>
            <l n="8.393"> Are profitless to others. </l>
            <l n="8.394">                            Turn we then </l>
            <l n="8.395"> To Britons born and bred within the pale </l>
            <l n="8.396"> Of civil polity, and early trained </l>
            <l n="8.397"> To earn, by wholesome labour in the field, </l>
            <l n="8.398"> The bread they eat. A sample should I give </l>
            <l n="8.399"> Of what this stock hath long produced to enrich </l>
            <l n="8.400"> The tender age of life, ye would exclaim, </l>
            <l n="8.401"> 'Is this the whistling plough-boy whose shrill notes </l>
            <l n="8.402"> Impart new gladness to the morning air!' </l>
            <l n="8.403"> Forgive me if I venture to suspect </l>
            <l n="8.404"> That many, sweet to hear of in soft verse, </l>
            <l n="8.405"> Are of no finer frame. Stiff are his joints; </l>
            <l n="8.406"> Beneath a cumbrous frock, that to the knees </l>
            <l n="8.407"> Invests the thriving churl, his legs appear, </l>
            <l n="8.408"> Fellows to those that lustily upheld </l>
            <l n="8.409"> The wooden stools for everlasting use, </l>
            <l n="8.410"> Whereon our fathers sate. And mark his brow </l>
            <l n="8.411"> Under whose shaggy canopy are set </l>
            <l n="8.412"> Two eyes—not dim, but of a healthy stare— </l>
            <l n="8.413"> Wide, sluggish, blank, and ignorant, and strange— </l>
            <l n="8.414"> Proclaiming boldly that they never drew </l>
            <l n="8.415"> A look or motion of intelligence </l>
            <l n="8.416"> From infant-conning of the Christ-crossrow, </l>
            <l n="8.417"> Or puzzling through a primer, line by line, </l>
            <l n="8.418"> Till perfect mastery crown the pains at last. </l>
            <l n="8.419"> —What kindly warmth from touch of fostering hand, </l>
            <l n="8.420"> What penetrating power of sun or breeze, </l>
            <l n="8.421"> Shall e'er dissolve the crust wherein his soul </l>
            <l n="8.422"> Sleeps, like a caterpillar sheathed in ice? </l>
            <l n="8.423"> This torpor is no pitiable work </l>
            <l n="8.424"> Of modern ingenuity; no town </l>
            <l n="8.425"> Nor crowded city can be taxed with aught </l>
            <l n="8.426"> Of sottish vice or desperate breach of law, </l>
            <l n="8.427"> To which (and who can tell where or how soon?) </l>
            <l n="8.428"> He may be roused. This Boy the fields produce: </l>
            <l n="8.429"> His spade and hoe, mattock and glittering scythe, </l>
            <l n="8.430"> The carter's whip that on his shoulder rests </l>
            <l n="8.431"> In air high-towering with a boorish pomp, </l>
            <l n="8.432"> The sceptre of his sway; his country's name, </l>
            <l n="8.433"> Her equal rights, her churches and her schools— </l>
            <l n="8.434"> What have they done for him? And, let me ask, </l>
            <l n="8.435"> For tens of thousands uninformed as he? </l>
            <l n="8.436"> In brief, what liberty of 'mind' is here?” </l>
            <l n="8.437">   This ardent sally pleased the mild good Man, </l>
            <l n="8.438"> To whom the appeal couched in its closing words </l>
            <l n="8.439"> Was pointedly addressed; and to the thoughts </l>
            <l n="8.440"> That, in assent or opposition, rose </l>
            <l n="8.441"> Within his mind, he seemed prepared to give </l>
            <l n="8.442"> Prompt utterance; but the Vicar interposed </l>
            <l n="8.443"> With invitation urgently renewed. </l>
            <l n="8.444"> —We followed, taking as he led, a path </l>
            <l n="8.445"> Along a hedge of hollies dark and tall, </l>
            <l n="8.446"> Whose flexile boughs low bending with a weight </l>
            <l n="8.447"> Of leafy spray, concealed the stems and roots </l>
            <l n="8.448"> That gave them nourishment. When frosty winds </l>
            <l n="8.449"> Howl from the north, what kindly warmth, methought, </l>
            <l n="8.450"> Is here—how grateful this impervious screen! </l>
            <l n="8.451"> —Not shaped by simple wearing of the foot </l>
            <l n="8.452"> On rural business passing to and fro </l>
            <l n="8.453"> Was the commodious walk: a careful hand </l>
            <l n="8.454"> Had marked the line, and strewn its surface o'er </l>
            <l n="8.455"> With pure cerulean gravel, from the heights </l>
            <l n="8.456"> Fetched by a neighbouring brook.—Across the vale </l>
            <l n="8.457"> The stately fence accompanied our steps; </l>
            <l n="8.458"> And thus the pathway, by perennial green </l>
            <l n="8.459"> Guarded and graced, seemed fashioned to unite, </l>
            <l n="8.460"> As by a beautiful yet solemn chain, </l>
            <l n="8.461"> The Pastor's mansion with the house of prayer. </l>
            <l n="8.462">   Like image of solemnity, conjoined </l>
            <l n="8.463"> With feminine allurement soft and fair, </l>
            <l n="8.464"> The mansion's self displayed;—a reverend pile </l>
            <l n="8.465"> With bold projections and recesses deep; </l>
            <l n="8.466"> Shadowy, yet gay and lightsome as it stood </l>
            <l n="8.467"> Fronting the noontide sun. We paused to admire </l>
            <l n="8.468"> The pillared porch, elaborately embossed; </l>
            <l n="8.469"> The low wide windows with their mullions old; </l>
            <l n="8.470"> The cornice, richly fretted, of grey stone; </l>
            <l n="8.471"> And that smooth slope from which the dwelling rose, </l>
            <l n="8.472"> By beds and banks Arcadian of gay flowers </l>
            <l n="8.473"> And flowering shrubs, protected and adorned: </l>
            <l n="8.474"> Profusion bright! and every flower assuming </l>
            <l n="8.475"> A more than natural vividness of hue, </l>
            <l n="8.476"> From unaffected contrast with the gloom </l>
            <l n="8.477"> Of sober cypress, and the darker foil </l>
            <l n="8.478"> Of yew, in which survived some traces, here </l>
            <l n="8.479"> Not unbecoming, of grotesque device </l>
            <l n="8.480"> And uncouth fancy. From behind the roof </l>
            <l n="8.481"> Rose the slim ash and massy sycamore, </l>
            <l n="8.482"> Blending their diverse foliage with the green </l>
            <l n="8.483"> Of ivy, flourishing and thick, that clasped </l>
            <l n="8.484"> The huge round chimneys, harbour of delight </l>
            <l n="8.485"> For wren and redbreast,—where they sit and sing </l>
            <l n="8.486"> Their slender ditties when the trees are bare. </l>
            <l n="8.487"> Nor must I leave untouched (the picture else </l>
            <l n="8.488"> Were incomplete) a relique of old times </l>
            <l n="8.489"> Happily spared, a little Gothic niche </l>
            <l n="8.490"> Of nicest workmanship; that once had held </l>
            <l n="8.491"> The sculptured image of some patron-saint, </l>
            <l n="8.492"> Or of the blessed Virgin, looking down </l>
            <l n="8.493"> On all who entered those religious doors. </l>
            <l n="8.494">   But lo! where from the rocky garden-mount </l>
            <l n="8.495"> Crowned by its antique summer-house—descends, </l>
            <l n="8.496"> Light as the silver fawn, a radiant Girl; </l>
            <l n="8.497"> For she hath recognised her honoured friend, </l>
            <l n="8.498"> The Wanderer ever welcome! A prompt kiss </l>
            <l n="8.499"> The gladsome Child bestows at his request; </l>
            <l n="8.500"> And, up the flowery lawn as we advance, </l>
            <l n="8.501"> Hangs on the old Man with a happy look, </l>
            <l n="8.502"> And with a pretty restless hand of love. </l>
            <l n="8.503"> —We enter—by the Lady of the place </l>
            <l n="8.504"> Cordially greeted. Graceful was her port: </l>
            <l n="8.505"> A lofty stature undepressed by time, </l>
            <l n="8.506"> Whose visitation had not wholly spared </l>
            <l n="8.507"> The finer lineaments of form and face; </l>
            <l n="8.508"> To that complexion brought which prudence trusts in </l>
            <l n="8.509"> And wisdom loves.—But when a stately ship </l>
            <l n="8.510"> Sails in smooth weather by the placid coast </l>
            <l n="8.511"> On homeward voyage, what—if wind and wave, </l>
            <l n="8.512"> And hardship undergone in various climes, </l>
            <l n="8.513"> Have caused her to abate the virgin pride, </l>
            <l n="8.514"> And that full trim of inexperienced hope </l>
            <l n="8.515"> With which she left her haven—not for this, </l>
            <l n="8.516"> Should the sun strike her, and the impartial breeze </l>
            <l n="8.517"> Play on her streamers, fails she to assume </l>
            <l n="8.518"> Brightness and touching beauty of her own, </l>
            <l n="8.519"> That charm all eyes. So bright, so fair, appeared </l>
            <l n="8.520"> This goodly Matron, shining in the beams </l>
            <l n="8.521"> Of unexpected pleasure.—Soon the board </l>
            <l n="8.522"> Was spread, and we partook a plain repast. </l>
            <l n="8.523">   Here, resting in cool shelter, we beguiled </l>
            <l n="8.524"> The mid-day hours with desultory talk; </l>
            <l n="8.525"> From trivial themes to general argument </l>
            <l n="8.526"> Passing, as accident or fancy led, </l>
            <l n="8.527"> Or courtesy prescribed. While question rose </l>
            <l n="8.528"> And answer flowed, the fetters of reserve </l>
            <l n="8.529"> Dropping from every mind, the Solitary </l>
            <l n="8.530"> Resumed the manners of his happier days; </l>
            <l n="8.531"> And in the various conversation bore </l>
            <l n="8.532"> A willing, nay, at times, a forward part; </l>
            <l n="8.533"> Yet with the grace of one who in the world </l>
            <l n="8.534"> Had learned the art of pleasing, and had now </l>
            <l n="8.535"> Occasion given him to display his skill, </l>
            <l n="8.536"> Upon the stedfast 'vantage-ground of truth. </l>
            <l n="8.537"> He gazed, with admiration unsuppressed, </l>
            <l n="8.538"> Upon the landscape of the sun-bright vale, </l>
            <l n="8.539"> Seen, from the shady room in which we sate, </l>
            <l n="8.540"> In softened perspective; and more than once </l>
            <l n="8.541"> Praised the consummate harmony serene </l>
            <l n="8.542"> Of gravity and elegance, diffused </l>
            <l n="8.543"> Around the mansion and its whole domain; </l>
            <l n="8.544"> Not, doubtless, without help of female taste </l>
            <l n="8.545"> And female care.—“A blessed lot is yours!” </l>
            <l n="8.546"> The words escaped his lip, with a tender sigh </l>
            <l n="8.547"> Breathed over them: but suddenly the door </l>
            <l n="8.548"> Flew open, and a pair of lusty Boys </l>
            <l n="8.549"> Appeared, confusion checking their delight. </l>
            <l n="8.550"> —Not brothers they in feature or attire, </l>
            <l n="8.551"> But fond companions, so I guessed, in field, </l>
            <l n="8.552"> And by the river's margin—whence they come, </l>
            <l n="8.553"> Keen anglers with unusual spoil elated. </l>
            <l n="8.554"> One bears a willow-pannier on his back, </l>
            <l n="8.555"> The boy of plainer garb, whose blush survives </l>
            <l n="8.556"> More deeply tinged. Twin might the other be </l>
            <l n="8.557"> To that fair girl who from the garden-mount </l>
            <l n="8.558"> Bounded:—triumphant entry this for him! </l>
            <l n="8.559"> Between his hands he holds a smooth blue stone, </l>
            <l n="8.560"> On whose capacious surface see outspread </l>
            <l n="8.561"> Large store of gleaming crimson-spotted trouts; </l>
            <l n="8.562"> Ranged side by side, and lessening by degrees </l>
            <l n="8.563"> Up to the dwarf that tops the pinnacle. </l>
            <l n="8.564"> Upon the board he lays the sky-blue stone </l>
            <l n="8.565"> With its rich freight; their number he proclaims; </l>
            <l n="8.566"> Tells from what pool the noblest had been dragged; </l>
            <l n="8.567"> And where the very monarch of the brook, </l>
            <l n="8.568"> After long struggle, had escaped at last— </l>
            <l n="8.569"> Stealing alternately at them and us </l>
            <l n="8.570"> (As doth his comrade too) a look of pride: </l>
            <l n="8.571"> And, verily, the silent creatures made </l>
            <l n="8.572"> A splendid sight, together thus exposed; </l>
            <l n="8.573"> Dead—but not sullied or deformed by death, </l>
            <l n="8.574"> That seemed to pity what he could not spare. </l>
            <l n="8.575">   But oh, the animation in the mien </l>
            <l n="8.576"> Of those two boys! yea in the very words </l>
            <l n="8.577"> With which the young narrator was inspired, </l>
            <l n="8.578"> When, as our questions led, he told at large </l>
            <l n="8.579"> Of that day's prowess! Him might I compare, </l>
            <l n="8.580"> His looks, tones, gestures, eager eloquence, </l>
            <l n="8.581"> To a bold brook that splits for better speed, </l>
            <l n="8.582"> And at the self-same moment, works its way </l>
            <l n="8.583"> Through many channels, ever and anon </l>
            <l n="8.584"> Parted and re-united: his compeer </l>
            <l n="8.585"> To the still lake, whose stillness is to sight </l>
            <l n="8.586"> As beautiful—as grateful to the mind. </l>
            <l n="8.587"> —But to what object shall the lovely Girl </l>
            <l n="8.588"> Be likened? She whose countenance and air </l>
            <l n="8.589"> Unite the graceful qualities of both, </l>
            <l n="8.590"> Even as she shares the pride and joy of both. </l>
            <l n="8.591">   My grey-haired Friend was moved; his vivid eye </l>
            <l n="8.592"> Glistened with tenderness; his mind, I knew, </l>
            <l n="8.593"> Was full; and had, I doubted not, returned, </l>
            <l n="8.594"> Upon this impulse, to the theme—erewhile </l>
            <l n="8.595"> Abruptly broken off. The ruddy boys </l>
            <l n="8.596"> Withdrew, on summons to their well-earned meal; </l>
            <l n="8.597"> And He—to whom all tongues resigned their rights </l>
            <l n="8.598"> With willingness, to whom the general ear </l>
            <l n="8.599"> Listened with readier patience than to strain </l>
            <l n="8.600"> Of music, lute or harp, a long delight </l>
            <l n="8.601"> That ceased not when his voice had ceased—as One </l>
            <l n="8.602"> Who from truth's central point serenely views </l>
            <l n="8.603"> The compass of his argument—began </l>
            <l n="8.604"> Mildly, and with a clear and steady tone. </l>

            <head>DISCOURSE OF THE WANDERER, AND AN EVENING VISIT TO THE LAKE</head>
            <head>ARGUMENT</head>
            <p>Wanderer asserts that an active principle pervades the Universe, 
its noblest seat the human soul—How lively this principle is in 
Childhood—Hence the delight in old Age of looking back upon 
Childhood—The dignity, powers, and privileges of Age asserted— 
These not to be looked for generally but under a just government— 
Right of a human Creature to be exempt from being considered as a 
mere Instrument—The condition of multitudes deplored—Former 
conversation recurred to, and the Wanderer's opinions set in a 
clearer light—Truth placed within reach of the humblest— 
Equality—Happy state of the two Boys again adverted to—Earnest 
wish expressed for a System of National Education established 
universally by Government—Glorious effects of this foretold—Walk 
to the Lake—Grand spectacle from the side of a hill—Address of 
Priest to the Supreme Being—In the course of which he contrasts 
with ancient Barbarism the present appearance of the scene before 
him—The change ascribed to Christianity—Apostrophe to his flock, 
living and dead—Gratitude to the Almighty—Return over the Lake— 
Parting with the Solitary—Under what circumstances. 
</p>
            <l n="9.1"> “TO every Form of being is assigned,” </l>
            <l n="9.2"> Thus calmly spake the venerable Sage, </l>
            <l n="9.3"> “An 'active' Principle:—howe'er removed </l>
            <l n="9.4"> From sense and observation, it subsists </l>
            <l n="9.5"> In all things, in all natures; in the stars </l>
            <l n="9.6"> Of azure heaven, the unenduring clouds, </l>
            <l n="9.7"> In flower and tree, in every pebbly stone </l>
            <l n="9.8"> That paves the brooks, the stationary rocks, </l>
            <l n="9.9"> The moving waters, and the invisible air. </l>
            <l n="9.10"> Whate'er exists hath properties that spread </l>
            <l n="9.11"> Beyond itself, communicating good </l>
            <l n="9.12"> A simple blessing, or with evil mixed; </l>
            <l n="9.13"> Spirit that knows no insulated spot, </l>
            <l n="9.14"> No chasm, no solitude; from link to link </l>
            <l n="9.15"> It circulates, the Soul of all the worlds. </l>
            <l n="9.16"> This is the freedom of the universe; </l>
            <l n="9.17"> Unfolded still the more, more visible, </l>
            <l n="9.18"> The more we know; and yet is reverenced least, </l>
            <l n="9.19"> And least respected in the human Mind, </l>
            <l n="9.20"> Its most apparent home. The food of hope </l>
            <l n="9.21"> Is meditated action; robbed of this </l>
            <l n="9.22"> Her sole support, she languishes and dies. </l>
            <l n="9.23"> We perish also; for we live by hope </l>
            <l n="9.24"> And by desire; we see by the glad light </l>
            <l n="9.25"> And breathe the sweet air of futurity; </l>
            <l n="9.26"> And so we live, or else we have no life. </l>
            <l n="9.27"> To-morrow—nay perchance this very hour </l>
            <l n="9.28"> (For every moment hath its own to-morrow!) </l>
            <l n="9.29"> Those blooming Boys, whose hearts are almost sick </l>
            <l n="9.30"> With present triumph, will be sure to find </l>
            <l n="9.31"> A field before them freshened with the dew </l>
            <l n="9.32"> Of other expectations;—in which course </l>
            <l n="9.33"> Their happy year spins round. The youth obeys </l>
            <l n="9.34"> A like glad impulse; and so moves the man </l>
            <l n="9.35"> 'Mid all his apprehensions, cares, and fears,— </l>
            <l n="9.36"> Or so he ought to move. Ah! why in age </l>
            <l n="9.37"> Do we revert so fondly to the walks </l>
            <l n="9.38"> Of childhood—but that there the Soul discerns </l>
            <l n="9.39"> The dear memorial footsteps unimpaired </l>
            <l n="9.40"> Of her own native vigour; thence can hear </l>
            <l n="9.41"> Reverberations; and a choral song, </l>
            <l n="9.42"> Commingling with the incense that ascends, </l>
            <l n="9.43"> Undaunted, toward the imperishable heavens, </l>
            <l n="9.44"> From her own lonely altar? </l>
            <l n="9.45">                             Do not think </l>
            <l n="9.46"> That good and wise ever will be allowed, </l>
            <l n="9.47"> Though strength decay, to breathe in such estate </l>
            <l n="9.48"> As shall divide them wholly from the stir </l>
            <l n="9.49"> Of hopeful nature. Rightly is it said </l>
            <l n="9.50"> That Man descends into the VALE of years; </l>
            <l n="9.51"> Yet have I thought that we might also speak, </l>
            <l n="9.52"> And not presumptuously, I trust, of Age, </l>
            <l n="9.53"> As of a final EMINENCE; though bare </l>
            <l n="9.54"> In aspect and forbidding, yet a point </l>
            <l n="9.55"> On which 'tis not impossible to sit </l>
            <l n="9.56"> In awful sovereignty; a place of power, </l>
            <l n="9.57"> A throne, that may be likened unto his, </l>
            <l n="9.58"> Who, in some placid day of summer, looks </l>
            <l n="9.59"> Down from a mountain-top,—say one of those </l>
            <l n="9.60"> High peaks, that bound the vale where now we are. </l>
            <l n="9.61"> Faint, and diminished to the gazing eye, </l>
            <l n="9.62"> Forest and field, and hill and dale appear, </l>
            <l n="9.63"> With all the shapes over their surface spread: </l>
            <l n="9.64"> But, while the gross and visible frame of things </l>
            <l n="9.65"> Relinquishes its hold upon the sense, </l>
            <l n="9.66"> Yea almost on the Mind herself, and seems </l>
            <l n="9.67"> All unsubstantialized,—how loud the voice </l>
            <l n="9.68"> Of waters, with invigorated peal </l>
            <l n="9.69"> From the full river in the vale below, </l>
            <l n="9.70"> Ascending! For on that superior height </l>
            <l n="9.71"> Who sits, is disencumbered from the press </l>
            <l n="9.72"> Of near obstructions, and is privileged </l>
            <l n="9.73"> To breathe in solitude, above the host </l>
            <l n="9.74"> Of ever-humming insects, 'mid thin air </l>
            <l n="9.75"> That suits not them. The murmur of the leaves </l>
            <l n="9.76"> Many and idle, visits not his ear: </l>
            <l n="9.77"> This he is freed from, and from thousand notes </l>
            <l n="9.78"> (Not less unceasing, not less vain than these,) </l>
            <l n="9.79"> By which the finer passages of sense </l>
            <l n="9.80"> Are occupied; and the Soul, that would incline </l>
            <l n="9.81"> To listen, is prevented or deterred. </l>
            <l n="9.82">   And may it not be hoped, that, placed by age </l>
            <l n="9.83"> In like removal, tranquil though severe, </l>
            <l n="9.84"> We are not so removed for utter loss; </l>
            <l n="9.85"> But for some favour, suited to our need? </l>
            <l n="9.86"> What more than that the severing should confer </l>
            <l n="9.87"> Fresh power to commune with the invisible world, </l>
            <l n="9.88"> And hear the mighty stream of tendency </l>
            <l n="9.89"> Uttering, for elevation of our thought, </l>
            <l n="9.90"> A clear sonorous voice, inaudible </l>
            <l n="9.91"> To the vast multitude; whose doom it is </l>
            <l n="9.92"> To run the giddy round of vain delight, </l>
            <l n="9.93"> Or fret and labour on the Plain below. </l>
            <l n="9.94">   But, if to such sublime ascent the hopes </l>
            <l n="9.95"> Of Man may rise, as to a welcome close </l>
            <l n="9.96"> And termination of his mortal course; </l>
            <l n="9.97"> Them only can such hope inspire whose minds </l>
            <l n="9.98"> Have not been starved by absolute neglect; </l>
            <l n="9.99"> Nor bodies crushed by unremitting toil; </l>
            <l n="9.100"> To whom kind Nature, therefore, may afford </l>
            <l n="9.101"> Proof of the sacred love she bears for all; </l>
            <l n="9.102"> Whose birthright Reason, therefore, may ensure. </l>
            <l n="9.103"> For me, consulting what I feel within </l>
            <l n="9.104"> In times when most existence with herself </l>
            <l n="9.105"> Is satisfied, I cannot but believe, </l>
            <l n="9.106"> That, far as kindly Nature hath free scope </l>
            <l n="9.107"> And Reason's sway predominates; even so far, </l>
            <l n="9.108"> Country, society, and time itself, </l>
            <l n="9.109"> That saps the individual's bodily frame, </l>
            <l n="9.110"> And lays the generations low in dust, </l>
            <l n="9.111"> Do, by the almighty Ruler's grace, partake </l>
            <l n="9.112"> Of one maternal spirit, bringing forth </l>
            <l n="9.113"> And cherishing with ever-constant love, </l>
            <l n="9.114"> That tires not, nor betrays. Our life is turned </l>
            <l n="9.115"> Out of her course, wherever man is made </l>
            <l n="9.116"> An offering, or a sacrifice, a tool </l>
            <l n="9.117"> Or implement, a passive thing employed </l>
            <l n="9.118"> As a brute mean, without acknowledgment </l>
            <l n="9.119"> Of common right or interest in the end; </l>
            <l n="9.120"> Used or abused, as selfishness may prompt. </l>
            <l n="9.121"> Say, what can follow for a rational soul </l>
            <l n="9.122"> Perverted thus, but weakness in all good, </l>
            <l n="9.123"> And strength in evil? Hence an after-call </l>
            <l n="9.124"> For chastisement, and custody, and bonds, </l>
            <l n="9.125"> And oft-times Death, avenger of the past, </l>
            <l n="9.126"> And the sole guardian in whose hands we dare </l>
            <l n="9.127"> Entrust the future.—Not for these sad issues </l>
            <l n="9.128"> Was Man created; but to obey the law </l>
            <l n="9.129"> Of life, and hope, and action. And 'tis known </l>
            <l n="9.130"> That when we stand upon our native soil, </l>
            <l n="9.131"> Unelbowed by such objects as oppress </l>
            <l n="9.132"> Our active powers, those powers themselves become </l>
            <l n="9.133"> Strong to subvert our noxious qualities: </l>
            <l n="9.134"> They sweep distemper from the busy day, </l>
            <l n="9.135"> And make the chalice of the big round year </l>
            <l n="9.136"> Run o'er with gladness; whence the Being moves </l>
            <l n="9.137"> In beauty through the world; and all who see </l>
            <l n="9.138"> Bless him, rejoicing in his neighbourhood.” </l>
            <l n="9.139">   “Then,” said the Solitary, “by what force </l>
            <l n="9.140"> Of language shall a feeling heart express </l>
            <l n="9.141"> Her sorrow for that multitude in whom </l>
            <l n="9.142"> We look for health from seeds that have been sown </l>
            <l n="9.143"> In sickness, and for increase in a power </l>
            <l n="9.144"> That works but by extinction? On themselves </l>
            <l n="9.145"> They cannot lean, nor turn to their own hearts </l>
            <l n="9.146"> To know what they must do; their wisdom is </l>
            <l n="9.147"> To look into the eyes of others, thence </l>
            <l n="9.148"> To be instructed what they must avoid: </l>
            <l n="9.149"> Or rather, let us say, how least observed, </l>
            <l n="9.150"> How with most quiet and most silent death, </l>
            <l n="9.151"> With the least taint and injury to the air </l>
            <l n="9.152"> The oppressor breathes, their human form divine, </l>
            <l n="9.153"> And their immortal soul, may waste away.” </l>
            <l n="9.154">   The Sage rejoined, “I thank you—you have spared </l>
            <l n="9.155"> My voice the utterance of a keen regret, </l>
            <l n="9.156"> A wide compassion which with you I share. </l>
            <l n="9.157"> When, heretofore, I placed before your sight </l>
            <l n="9.158"> A Little-one, subjected to the arts </l>
            <l n="9.159"> Of modern ingenuity, and made </l>
            <l n="9.160"> The senseless member of a vast machine, </l>
            <l n="9.161"> Serving as doth a spindle or a wheel; </l>
            <l n="9.162"> Think not, that, pitying him, I could forget </l>
            <l n="9.163"> The rustic Boy, who walks the fields, untaught; </l>
            <l n="9.164"> The slave of ignorance, and oft of want, </l>
            <l n="9.165"> And miserable hunger. Much, too much, </l>
            <l n="9.166"> Of this unhappy lot, in early youth </l>
            <l n="9.167"> We both have witnessed, lot which I myself </l>
            <l n="9.168"> Shared, though in mild and merciful degree: </l>
            <l n="9.169"> Yet was the mind to hindrances exposed, </l>
            <l n="9.170"> Through which I struggled, not without distress </l>
            <l n="9.171"> And sometimes injury, like a lamb enthralled </l>
            <l n="9.172"> 'Mid thorns and brambles; or a bird that breaks </l>
            <l n="9.173"> Through a strong net, and mounts upon the wind, </l>
            <l n="9.174"> Though with her plumes impaired. If they, whose souls </l>
            <l n="9.175"> Should open while they range the richer fields </l>
            <l n="9.176"> Of merry England, are obstructed less </l>
            <l n="9.177"> By indigence, their ignorance is not less, </l>
            <l n="9.178"> Nor less to be deplored. For who can doubt </l>
            <l n="9.179"> That tens of thousands at this day exist </l>
            <l n="9.180"> Such as the boy you painted, lineal heirs </l>
            <l n="9.181"> Of those who once were vassals of her soil, </l>
            <l n="9.182"> Following its fortunes like the beasts or trees </l>
            <l n="9.183"> Which it sustained. But no one takes delight </l>
            <l n="9.184"> In this oppression; none are proud of it; </l>
            <l n="9.185"> It bears no sounding name, nor ever bore; </l>
            <l n="9.186"> A standing grievance, an indigenous vice </l>
            <l n="9.187"> Of every country under heaven. My thoughts </l>
            <l n="9.188"> Were turned to evils that are new and chosen, </l>
            <l n="9.189"> A bondage lurking under shape of good,— </l>
            <l n="9.190"> Arts, in themselves beneficent and kind, </l>
            <l n="9.191"> But all too fondly followed and too far;— </l>
            <l n="9.192"> To victims, which the merciful can see </l>
            <l n="9.193"> Nor think that they are victims—turned to wrongs, </l>
            <l n="9.194"> By women, who have children of their own, </l>
            <l n="9.195"> Beheld without compassion, yea with praise! </l>
            <l n="9.196"> I spake of mischief by the wise diffused </l>
            <l n="9.197"> With gladness, thinking that the more it spreads </l>
            <l n="9.198"> The healthier, the securer, we become; </l>
            <l n="9.199"> Delusion which a moment may destroy! </l>
            <l n="9.200"> Lastly, I mourned for those whom I had seen </l>
            <l n="9.201"> Corrupted and cast down, on favoured ground, </l>
            <l n="9.202"> Where circumstance and nature had combined </l>
            <l n="9.203"> To shelter innocence, and cherish love; </l>
            <l n="9.204"> Who, but for this intrusion, would have lived, </l>
            <l n="9.205"> Possessed of health, and strength, and peace of mind; </l>
            <l n="9.206"> Thus would have lived, or never have been born. </l>
            <l n="9.207">   Alas! what differs more than man from man! </l>
            <l n="9.208"> And whence that difference? whence but from himself? </l>
            <l n="9.209"> For see the universal Race endowed </l>
            <l n="9.210"> With the same upright form!—The sun is fixed, </l>
            <l n="9.211"> And the infinite magnificence of heaven </l>
            <l n="9.212"> Fixed, within reach of every human eye; </l>
            <l n="9.213"> The sleepless ocean murmurs for all ears; </l>
            <l n="9.214"> The vernal field infuses fresh delight </l>
            <l n="9.215"> Into all hearts. Throughout the world of sense, </l>
            <l n="9.216"> Even as an object is sublime or fair, </l>
            <l n="9.217"> That object is laid open to the view </l>
            <l n="9.218"> Without reserve or veil; and as a power </l>
            <l n="9.219"> Is salutary, or an influence sweet, </l>
            <l n="9.220"> Are each and all enabled to perceive </l>
            <l n="9.221"> That power, that influence, by impartial law. </l>
            <l n="9.222"> Gifts nobler are vouchsafed alike to all; </l>
            <l n="9.223"> Reason, and, with that reason, smiles and tears; </l>
            <l n="9.224"> Imagination, freedom in the will; </l>
            <l n="9.225"> Conscience to guide and check; and death to be </l>
            <l n="9.226"> Foretasted, immortality conceived </l>
            <l n="9.227"> By all,—a blissful immortality, </l>
            <l n="9.228"> To them whose holiness on earth shall make </l>
            <l n="9.229"> The Spirit capable of heaven, assured. </l>
            <l n="9.230"> Strange, then, nor less than monstrous, might be deemed </l>
            <l n="9.231"> The failure, if the Almighty, to this point </l>
            <l n="9.232"> Liberal and undistinguishing, should hide </l>
            <l n="9.233"> The excellence of moral qualities </l>
            <l n="9.234"> From common understanding; leaving truth </l>
            <l n="9.235"> And virtue, difficult, abstruse, and dark; </l>
            <l n="9.236"> Hard to be won, and only by a few; </l>
            <l n="9.237"> Strange, should He deal herein with nice respects, </l>
            <l n="9.238"> And frustrate all the rest! Believe it not: </l>
            <l n="9.239"> The primal duties shine aloft—like stars; </l>
            <l n="9.240"> The charities that soothe, and heal, and bless, </l>
            <l n="9.241"> Are scattered at the feet of Man—like flowers. </l>
            <l n="9.242"> The generous inclination, the just rule, </l>
            <l n="9.243"> Kind wishes, and good actions, and pure thoughts— </l>
            <l n="9.244"> No mystery is here! Here is no boon </l>
            <l n="9.245"> For high—yet not for low; for proudly graced— </l>
            <l n="9.246"> Yet not for meek of heart. The smoke ascends </l>
            <l n="9.247"> To heaven as lightly from the cottage hearth </l>
            <l n="9.248"> As from the haughtiest palace. He, whose soul </l>
            <l n="9.249"> Ponders this true equality, may walk </l>
            <l n="9.250"> The fields of earth with gratitude and hope; </l>
            <l n="9.251"> Yet, in that meditation, will he find </l>
            <l n="9.252"> Motive to sadder grief, as we have found; </l>
            <l n="9.253"> Lamenting ancient virtues overthrown, </l>
            <l n="9.254"> And for the injustice grieving, that hath made </l>
            <l n="9.255"> So wide a difference between man and man. </l>
            <l n="9.256">   Then let us rather fix our gladdened thoughts </l>
            <l n="9.257"> Upon the brighter scene. How blest that pair </l>
            <l n="9.258"> Of blooming Boys (whom we beheld even now) </l>
            <l n="9.259"> Blest in their several and their common lot! </l>
            <l n="9.260"> A few short hours of each returning day </l>
            <l n="9.261"> The thriving prisoners of their village school: </l>
            <l n="9.262"> And thence let loose, to seek their pleasant homes </l>
            <l n="9.263"> Or range the grassy lawn in vacancy: </l>
            <l n="9.264"> To breathe and to he happy, run and shout </l>
            <l n="9.265"> Idle,—but no delay, no harm, no loss; </l>
            <l n="9.266"> For every genial power of heaven and earth, </l>
            <l n="9.267"> Through all the seasons of the changeful year, </l>
            <l n="9.268"> Obsequiously doth take upon herself </l>
            <l n="9.269"> To labour for them; bringing each in turn </l>
            <l n="9.270"> The tribute of enjoyment, knowledge, health, </l>
            <l n="9.271"> Beauty, or strength! Such privilege is theirs, </l>
            <l n="9.272"> Granted alike in the outset of their course </l>
            <l n="9.273"> To both; and, if that partnership must cease, </l>
            <l n="9.274"> I grieve not,” to the Pastor here he turned, </l>
            <l n="9.275"> “Much as I glory in that child of yours, </l>
            <l n="9.276"> Repine not for his cottage-comrade, whom </l>
            <l n="9.277"> Belike no higher destiny awaits </l>
            <l n="9.278"> Than the old hereditary wish fulfilled; </l>
            <l n="9.279"> The wish for liberty to live—content </l>
            <l n="9.280"> With what Heaven grants, and die—in peace of mind, </l>
            <l n="9.281"> Within the bosom of his native vale. </l>
            <l n="9.282"> At least, whatever fate the noon of life </l>
            <l n="9.283"> Reserves for either, sure it is that both </l>
            <l n="9.284"> Have been permitted to enjoy the dawn; </l>
            <l n="9.285"> Whether regarded as a jocund time, </l>
            <l n="9.286"> That in itself may terminate, or lead </l>
            <l n="9.287"> In course of nature to a sober eve. </l>
            <l n="9.288"> Both have been fairly dealt with; looking back </l>
            <l n="9.289"> They will allow that justice has in them </l>
            <l n="9.290"> Been shown, alike to body and to mind.” </l>
            <l n="9.291">   He paused, as if revolving in his soul </l>
            <l n="9.292"> Some weighty matter; then, with fervent voice </l>
            <l n="9.293"> And an impassioned majesty, exclaimed— </l>
            <l n="9.294">   “O for the coming of that glorious time </l>
            <l n="9.295"> When, prizing knowledge as her noblest wealth </l>
            <l n="9.296"> And best protection, this imperial Realm, </l>
            <l n="9.297"> While she exacts allegiance, shall admit </l>
            <l n="9.298"> An obligation, on her part, to 'teach' </l>
            <l n="9.299"> Them who are born to serve her and obey; </l>
            <l n="9.300"> Binding herself by statute to secure </l>
            <l n="9.301"> For all the children whom her soil maintains </l>
            <l n="9.302"> The rudiments of letters, and inform </l>
            <l n="9.303"> The mind with moral and religious truth, </l>
            <l n="9.304"> Both understood and practised,—so that none, </l>
            <l n="9.305"> However destitute, be left to droop </l>
            <l n="9.306"> By timely culture unsustained; or run </l>
            <l n="9.307"> Into a wild disorder; or be forced </l>
            <l n="9.308"> To drudge through a weary life without the help </l>
            <l n="9.309"> Of intellectual implements and tools; </l>
            <l n="9.310"> A savage horde among the civilised, </l>
            <l n="9.311"> A servile band among the lordly free! </l>
            <l n="9.312"> This sacred right, the lisping babe proclaims </l>
            <l n="9.313"> To be inherent in him, by Heaven's will, </l>
            <l n="9.314"> For the protection of his innocence; </l>
            <l n="9.315"> And the rude boy—who, having overpast </l>
            <l n="9.316"> The sinless age, by conscience is enrolled, </l>
            <l n="9.317"> Yet mutinously knits his angry brow, </l>
            <l n="9.318"> And lifts his wilful hand on mischief bent, </l>
            <l n="9.319"> Or turns the godlike faculty of speech </l>
            <l n="9.320"> To impious use—by process indirect </l>
            <l n="9.321"> Declares his due, while he makes known his need. </l>
            <l n="9.322"> —This sacred right is fruitlessly announced, </l>
            <l n="9.323"> This universal plea in vain addressed, </l>
            <l n="9.324"> To eyes and ears of parents who themselves </l>
            <l n="9.325"> Did, in the time of their necessity, </l>
            <l n="9.326"> Urge it in vain; and, therefore, like a prayer </l>
            <l n="9.327"> That from the humblest floor ascends to heaven, </l>
            <l n="9.328"> It mounts to meet the State's parental ear; </l>
            <l n="9.329"> Who, if indeed she own a mother's heart, </l>
            <l n="9.330"> And be not most unfeelingly devoid </l>
            <l n="9.331"> Of gratitude to Providence, will grant </l>
            <l n="9.332"> The unquestionable good—which, England, safe </l>
            <l n="9.333"> From interference of external force, </l>
            <l n="9.334"> May grant at leisure; without risk incurred </l>
            <l n="9.335"> That what in wisdom for herself she doth, </l>
            <l n="9.336"> Others shall e'er be able to undo. </l>
            <l n="9.337">   Look! and behold, from Calpe's sun-burnt cliffs </l>
            <l n="9.338"> To the flat margin of the Baltic sea, </l>
            <l n="9.339"> Long-reverenced titles cast away as weeds; </l>
            <l n="9.340"> Laws overturned; and territory split, </l>
            <l n="9.341"> Like fields of ice rent by the polar wind, </l>
            <l n="9.342"> And forced to join in less obnoxious shapes </l>
            <l n="9.343"> Which, ere they gain consistence, by a gust </l>
            <l n="9.344"> Of the same breath are shattered and destroyed. </l>
            <l n="9.345"> Meantime the sovereignty of these fair Isles </l>
            <l n="9.346"> Remains entire and indivisible: </l>
            <l n="9.347"> And, if that ignorance were removed, which breeds </l>
            <l n="9.348"> Within the compass of their several shores </l>
            <l n="9.349"> Dark discontent, or loud commotion, each </l>

            <l n="9.352"> —The discipline of slavery is unknown </l>
            <l n="9.353"> Among us,—hence the more do we require </l>
            <l n="9.354"> The discipline of virtue; order else </l>
            <l n="9.355"> Cannot subsist, nor confidence, nor peace. </l>
            <l n="9.356"> Thus, duties rising out of good possest, </l>
            <l n="9.357"> And prudent caution needful to avert </l>
            <l n="9.358"> Impending evil, equally require </l>
            <l n="9.359"> That the whole people should be taught and trained. </l>
            <l n="9.360"> So shall licentiousness and black resolve </l>
            <l n="9.361"> Be rooted out, and virtuous habits take </l>
            <l n="9.362"> Their place; and genuine piety descend, </l>
            <l n="9.363"> Like an inheritance, from age to age. </l>
            <l n="9.364">   With such foundations laid, avaunt the fear </l>
            <l n="9.365"> Of numbers crowded on their native soil, </l>
            <l n="9.366"> To the prevention of all healthful growth </l>
            <l n="9.367"> Through mutual injury! Rather in the law </l>
            <l n="9.368"> Of increase and the mandate from above </l>
            <l n="9.369"> Rejoice!—and ye have special cause for joy. </l>
            <l n="9.370"> —For, as the element of air affords </l>
            <l n="9.371"> An easy passage to the industrious bees </l>
            <l n="9.372"> Fraught with their burthens; and a way as smooth </l>
            <l n="9.373"> For those ordained to take their sounding flight </l>

            <l n="9.414"> Now, when destruction is a prime pursuit, </l>
            <l n="9.415"> Show to the wretched nations for what end </l>
            <l n="9.416"> The powers of civil polity were given.” </l>
            <l n="9.417">   Abruptly here, but with a graceful air, </l>
            <l n="9.418"> The Sage broke off. No sooner had he ceased </l>
            <l n="9.419"> Than, looking forth, the gentle Lady said, </l>
            <l n="9.420"> “Behold the shades of afternoon have fallen </l>
            <l n="9.421"> Upon this flowery slope; and see—beyond— </l>
            <l n="9.422"> The silvery lake is streaked with placid blue; </l>
            <l n="9.423"> As if preparing for the peace of evening. </l>
            <l n="9.424"> How temptingly the landscape shines! The air </l>
            <l n="9.425"> Breathes invitation; easy is the walk </l>
            <l n="9.426"> To the lake's margin, where a boat lies moored </l>

            <l n="9.428"> We rose together; all were pleased; but most </l>
            <l n="9.429"> The beauteous girl, whose cheek was flushed with joy. </l>
            <l n="9.430"> Light as a sunbeam glides along the hills </l>
            <l n="9.431"> She vanished—eager to impart the scheme </l>
            <l n="9.432"> To her loved brother and his shy compeer. </l>
            <l n="9.433"> —Now was there bustle in the Vicar's house </l>
            <l n="9.434"> And earnest preparation.—Forth we went, </l>
            <l n="9.435"> And down the vale along the streamlet's edge </l>
            <l n="9.436"> Pursued our way, a broken company, </l>
            <l n="9.437"> Mute or conversing, single or in pairs. </l>
            <l n="9.438"> Thus having reached a bridge, that overarched </l>
            <l n="9.439"> The hasty rivulet where it lay becalmed </l>
            <l n="9.440"> In a deep pool, by happy chance we saw </l>
            <l n="9.441"> A twofold image; on a grassy bank </l>
            <l n="9.442"> A snow-white ram, and in the crystal flood </l>
            <l n="9.443"> Another and the same! Most beautiful, </l>
            <l n="9.444"> On the green turf, with his imperial front </l>
            <l n="9.445"> Shaggy and bold, and wreathed horns superb, </l>
            <l n="9.446"> The breathing creature stood; as beautiful, </l>
            <l n="9.447"> Beneath him, showed his shadowy counterpart. </l>
            <l n="9.448"> Each had his glowing mountains, each his sky, </l>
            <l n="9.449"> And each seemed centre of his own fair world: </l>
            <l n="9.450"> Antipodes unconscious of each other, </l>
            <l n="9.451"> Yet, in partition, with their several spheres, </l>
            <l n="9.452"> Blended in perfect stillness, to our sight! </l>
            <l n="9.453">   “Ah! what a pity were it to disperse, </l>
            <l n="9.454"> Or to disturb, so fair a spectacle, </l>
            <l n="9.455"> And yet a breath can do it!” </l>
            <l n="9.456">                               These few words </l>
            <l n="9.457"> The Lady whispered, while we stood and gazed </l>
            <l n="9.458"> Gathered together, all in still delight, </l>
            <l n="9.459"> Not without awe. Thence passing on, she said </l>
            <l n="9.460"> In like low voice to my particular ear, </l>
            <l n="9.461"> “I love to hear that eloquent old Man </l>
            <l n="9.462"> Pour forth his meditations, and descant </l>
            <l n="9.463"> On human life from infancy to age. </l>
            <l n="9.464"> How pure his spirit! in what vivid hues </l>
            <l n="9.465"> His mind gives back the various forms of things, </l>
            <l n="9.466"> Caught in their fairest, happiest, attitude! </l>
            <l n="9.467"> While he is speaking, I have power to see </l>
            <l n="9.468"> Even as he sees; but when his voice hath ceased, </l>
            <l n="9.469"> Then, with a sigh, sometimes I feel, as now, </l>
            <l n="9.470"> That combinations so serene and bright </l>
            <l n="9.471"> Cannot be lasting in a world like ours, </l>
            <l n="9.472"> Whose highest beauty, beautiful as it is, </l>
            <l n="9.473"> Like that reflected in yon quiet pool, </l>
            <l n="9.474"> Seems but a fleeting sunbeam's gift, whose peace, </l>
            <l n="9.475"> The sufferance only of a breath of air!” </l>
            <l n="9.476">   More had she said—but sportive shouts were heard </l>
            <l n="9.477"> Sent from the jocund hearts of those two Boys, </l>
            <l n="9.478"> Who, bearing each a basket on his arm, </l>
            <l n="9.479"> Down the green field came tripping after us. </l>
            <l n="9.480"> With caution we embarked; and now the pair </l>
            <l n="9.481"> For prouder service were addrest; but each, </l>
            <l n="9.482"> Wishful to leave an opening for my choice, </l>
            <l n="9.483"> Dropped the light oar his eager hand had seized. </l>
            <l n="9.484"> Thanks given for that becoming courtesy, </l>
            <l n="9.485"> Their place I took—and for a grateful office </l>
            <l n="9.486"> Pregnant with recollections of the time </l>
            <l n="9.487"> When, on thy bosom, spacious Windermere! </l>
            <l n="9.488"> A Youth, I practised this delightful art; </l>
            <l n="9.489"> Tossed on the waves alone, or 'mid a crew </l>
            <l n="9.490"> Of joyous comrades. Soon as the reedy marge </l>
            <l n="9.491"> Was cleared, I dipped, with arms accordant, oars </l>
            <l n="9.492"> Free from obstruction; and the boat advanced </l>
            <l n="9.493"> Through crystal water, smoothly as a hawk, </l>
            <l n="9.494"> That, disentangled from the shady boughs </l>
            <l n="9.495"> Of some thick wood, her place of covert, cleaves </l>
            <l n="9.496"> With correspondent wings the abyss of air. </l>
            <l n="9.497"> —“Observe,” the Vicar said, “yon rocky isle </l>
            <l n="9.498"> With birch-trees fringed; my hand shall guide the helm, </l>
            <l n="9.499"> While thitherward we shape our course; or while </l>
            <l n="9.500"> We seek that other, on the western shore; </l>
            <l n="9.501"> Where the bare columns of those lofty firs, </l>
            <l n="9.502"> Supporting gracefully a massy dome </l>
            <l n="9.503"> Of sombre foliage, seem to imitate </l>
            <l n="9.504"> A Grecian temple rising from the Deep.” </l>
            <l n="9.505">   “Turn where we may,” said I, “we cannot err </l>
            <l n="9.506"> In this delicious region.”—Cultured slopes, </l>
            <l n="9.507"> Wild tracts of forest-ground, and scattered groves, </l>
            <l n="9.508"> And mountains bare, or clothed with ancient woods, </l>
            <l n="9.509"> Surrounded us; and, as we held our way </l>
            <l n="9.510"> Along the level of the glassy flood, </l>
            <l n="9.511"> They ceased not to surround us; change of place </l>
            <l n="9.512"> From kindred features diversely combined, </l>
            <l n="9.513"> Producing change of beauty ever new. </l>
            <l n="9.514"> —Ah! that such beauty, varying in the light </l>
            <l n="9.515"> Of living nature, cannot be portrayed </l>
            <l n="9.516"> By words, nor by the pencil's silent skill; </l>
            <l n="9.517"> But is the property of him alone </l>
            <l n="9.518"> Who hath beheld it, noted it with care, </l>
            <l n="9.519"> And in his mind recorded it with love! </l>
            <l n="9.520"> Suffice it, therefore, if the rural Muse </l>
            <l n="9.521"> Vouchsafe sweet influence, while her Poet speaks </l>
            <l n="9.522"> Of trivial occupations well devised, </l>
            <l n="9.523"> And unsought pleasures springing up by chance; </l>
            <l n="9.524"> As if some friendly Genius had ordained </l>
            <l n="9.525"> That, as the day thus far had been enriched </l>
            <l n="9.526"> By acquisition of sincere delight, </l>
            <l n="9.527"> The same should be continued to its close. </l>
            <l n="9.528">   One spirit animating old and young, </l>
            <l n="9.529"> A gipsy-fire we kindled on the shore </l>
            <l n="9.530"> Of the fair Isle with birch-trees fringed—and there, </l>
            <l n="9.531"> Merrily seated in a ring, partook </l>
            <l n="9.532"> A choice repast—served by our young companions </l>
            <l n="9.533"> With rival earnestness and kindred glee. </l>
            <l n="9.534"> Launched from our hands the smooth stone skimmed the lake; </l>
            <l n="9.535"> With shouts we raised the echoes:—stiller sounds </l>
            <l n="9.536"> The lovely Girl supplied—a simple song, </l>
            <l n="9.537"> Whose low tones reached not to the distant rocks </l>
            <l n="9.538"> To be repeated thence, but gently sank </l>
            <l n="9.539"> Into our hearts; and charmed the peaceful flood. </l>
            <l n="9.540"> Rapaciously we gathered flowery spoils </l>
            <l n="9.541"> From land and water; lilies of each hue— </l>
            <l n="9.542"> Golden and white, that float upon the waves, </l>
            <l n="9.543"> And court the wind; and leaves of that shy plant, </l>
            <l n="9.544"> (Her flowers were shed) the lily of the vale, </l>
            <l n="9.545"> That loves the ground, and from the sun withholds </l>
            <l n="9.546"> Her pensive beauty; from the breeze her sweets. </l>
            <l n="9.547">   Such product, and such pastime, did the place </l>
            <l n="9.548"> And season yield; but, as we re-embarked, </l>
            <l n="9.549"> Leaving, in quest of other scenes, the shore </l>
            <l n="9.550"> Of that wild spot, the Solitary said </l>
            <l n="9.551"> In a low voice, yet careless who might hear, </l>
            <l n="9.552"> “The fire, that burned so brightly to our wish, </l>
            <l n="9.553"> Where is it now?—Deserted on the beach— </l>
            <l n="9.554"> Dying, or dead! Nor shall the fanning breeze </l>
            <l n="9.555"> Revive its ashes. What care we for this, </l>
            <l n="9.556"> Whose ends are gained? Behold an emblem here </l>
            <l n="9.557"> Of one day's pleasure, and all mortal joys! </l>
            <l n="9.558"> And, in this unpremeditated slight </l>
            <l n="9.559"> Of that which is no longer needed, see </l>
            <l n="9.560"> The common course of human gratitude!” </l>
            <l n="9.561">   This plaintive note disturbed not the repose </l>
            <l n="9.562"> Of the still evening. Right across the lake </l>
            <l n="9.563"> Our pinnace moves; then, coasting creek and bay, </l>
            <l n="9.564"> Glades we behold, and into thickets peep, </l>
            <l n="9.565"> Where couch the spotted deer; or raised our eyes </l>
            <l n="9.566"> To shaggy steeps on which the careless goat </l>
            <l n="9.567"> Browsed by the side of dashing waterfalls; </l>
            <l n="9.568"> And thus the bark, meandering with the shore, </l>
            <l n="9.569"> Pursued her voyage, till a natural pier </l>
            <l n="9.570"> Of jutting rock invited us to land. </l>
            <l n="9.571">   Alert to follow as the Pastor led, </l>
            <l n="9.572"> We clomb a green hill's side; and, as we clomb, </l>
            <l n="9.573"> The Valley, opening out her bosom, gave </l>
            <l n="9.574"> Fair prospect, intercepted less and less, </l>
            <l n="9.575"> O'er the flat meadows and indented coast </l>
            <l n="9.576"> Of the smooth lake, in compass seen:—far off, </l>
            <l n="9.577"> And yet conspicuous, stood the old Church-tower, </l>
            <l n="9.578"> In majesty presiding over fields </l>
            <l n="9.579"> And habitations seemingly preserved </l>
            <l n="9.580"> From all intrusion of the restless world </l>
            <l n="9.581"> By rocks impassable and mountains huge. </l>
            <l n="9.582">   Soft heath this elevated spot supplied, </l>
            <l n="9.583"> And choice of moss-clad stones, whereon we couched </l>
            <l n="9.584"> Or sate reclined; admiring quietly </l>
            <l n="9.585"> The general aspect of the scene; but each </l>
            <l n="9.586"> Not seldom over anxious to make known </l>
            <l n="9.587"> His own discoveries; or to favourite points </l>
            <l n="9.588"> Directing notice, merely from a wish </l>
            <l n="9.589"> To impart a joy, imperfect while unshared. </l>
            <l n="9.590"> That rapturous moment never shall I forget </l>
            <l n="9.591"> When these particular interests were effaced </l>
            <l n="9.592"> From every mind!—Already had the sun, </l>
            <l n="9.593"> Sinking with less than ordinary state, </l>
            <l n="9.594"> Attained his western bound; but rays of light— </l>
            <l n="9.595"> Now suddenly diverging from the orb </l>
            <l n="9.596"> Retired behind the mountain tops or veiled </l>
            <l n="9.597"> By the dense air—shot upwards to the crown </l>
            <l n="9.598"> Of the blue firmament—aloft, and wide: </l>
            <l n="9.599"> And multitudes of little floating clouds, </l>
            <l n="9.600"> Through their ethereal texture pierced—ere we, </l>
            <l n="9.601"> Who saw, of change were conscious—had become </l>
            <l n="9.602"> Vivid as fire; clouds separately poised,— </l>
            <l n="9.603"> Innumerable multitude of forms </l>
            <l n="9.604"> Scattered through half the circle of the sky; </l>
            <l n="9.605"> And giving back, and shedding each on each, </l>
            <l n="9.606"> With prodigal communion, the bright hues </l>
            <l n="9.607"> Which from the unapparent fount of glory </l>
            <l n="9.608"> They had imbibed, and ceased not to receive. </l>
            <l n="9.609"> That which the heavens displayed, the liquid deep </l>
            <l n="9.610"> Repeated; but with unity sublime! </l>
            <l n="9.611">   While from the grassy mountain's open side </l>
            <l n="9.612"> We gazed, in silence hushed, with eyes intent </l>
            <l n="9.613"> On the refulgent spectacle, diffused </l>
            <l n="9.614"> Through earth, sky, water, and all visible space, </l>
            <l n="9.615"> The Priest in holy transport thus exclaimed: </l>
            <l n="9.616"> “Eternal Spirit! universal God! </l>
            <l n="9.617"> Power inaccessible to human thought, </l>
            <l n="9.618"> Save by degrees and steps which thou hast deigned </l>
            <l n="9.619"> To furnish; for this effluence of thyself, </l>
            <l n="9.620"> To the infirmity of mortal sense </l>
            <l n="9.621"> Vouchsafed; this local transitory type </l>
            <l n="9.622"> Of thy paternal splendours, and the pomp </l>
            <l n="9.623"> Of those who fill thy courts in highest heaven, </l>
            <l n="9.624"> The radiant Cherubim;—accept the thanks </l>
            <l n="9.625"> Which we, thy humble Creatures, here convened, </l>
            <l n="9.626"> Presume to offer; we, who—from the breast </l>
            <l n="9.627"> Of the frail earth, permitted to behold </l>
            <l n="9.628"> The faint reflections only of thy face— </l>
            <l n="9.629"> Are yet exalted, and in soul adore! </l>
            <l n="9.630"> Such as they are who in thy presence stand </l>
            <l n="9.631"> Unsullied, incorruptible, and drink </l>
            <l n="9.632"> Imperishable majesty streamed forth </l>
            <l n="9.633"> From thy empyreal throne, the elect of earth </l>
            <l n="9.634"> Shall be—divested at the appointed hour </l>
            <l n="9.635"> Of all dishonour, cleansed from mortal stain. </l>
            <l n="9.636"> —Accomplish, then, their number; and conclude </l>
            <l n="9.637"> Time's weary course! Or if, by thy decree, </l>
            <l n="9.638"> The consummation that will come by stealth </l>
            <l n="9.639"> Be yet far distant, let thy Word prevail, </l>
            <l n="9.640"> Oh! let thy Word prevail, to take away </l>
            <l n="9.641"> The sting of human nature. Spread the law, </l>
            <l n="9.642"> As it is written in thy holy book, </l>
            <l n="9.643"> Throughout all lands; let every nation hear </l>
            <l n="9.644"> The high behest, and every heart obey; </l>
            <l n="9.645"> Both for the love of purity, and hope </l>
            <l n="9.646"> Which it affords, to such as do thy will </l>
            <l n="9.647"> And persevere in good, that they shall rise, </l>
            <l n="9.648"> To have a nearer view of thee, in heaven. </l>
            <l n="9.649"> —Father of good! this prayer in bounty grant, </l>
            <l n="9.650"> In mercy grant it, to thy wretched sons. </l>
            <l n="9.651"> Then, not till then, shall persecution cease, </l>
            <l n="9.652"> And cruel wars expire. The way is marked, </l>
            <l n="9.653"> The guide appointed, and the ransom paid. </l>
            <l n="9.654"> Alas! the nations, who of yore received </l>
            <l n="9.655"> These tidings, and in Christian temples meet </l>
            <l n="9.656"> The sacred truth to knowledge, linger still; </l>
            <l n="9.657"> Preferring bonds and darkness to a state </l>
            <l n="9.658"> Of holy freedom, by redeeming love </l>
            <l n="9.659"> Proffered to all, while yet on earth detained. </l>
            <l n="9.660">   So fare the many; and the thoughtful few, </l>
            <l n="9.661"> Who in the anguish of their souls bewail </l>
            <l n="9.662"> This dire perverseness, cannot choose but ask, </l>
            <l n="9.663"> Shall it endure?—Shall enmity and strife, </l>
            <l n="9.664"> Falsehood and guile, be left to sow their seed; </l>
            <l n="9.665"> And the kind never perish? Is the hope </l>
            <l n="9.666"> Fallacious, or shall righteousness obtain </l>
            <l n="9.667"> A peaceable dominion, wide as earth, </l>
            <l n="9.668"> And ne'er to fail? Shall that blest day arrive </l>
            <l n="9.669"> When they, whose choice or lot it is to dwell </l>
            <l n="9.670"> In crowded cities, without fear shall live </l>
            <l n="9.671"> Studious of mutual benefit; and he, </l>
            <l n="9.672"> Whom Morn awakens, among dews and flowers </l>
            <l n="9.673"> Of every clime, to till the lonely field, </l>
            <l n="9.674"> Be happy in himself?—The law of faith </l>
            <l n="9.675"> Working through love, such conquest shall it gain, </l>
            <l n="9.676"> Such triumph over sin and guilt achieve? </l>
            <l n="9.677"> Almighty Lord, thy further grace impart! </l>
            <l n="9.678"> And with that help the wonder shall be seen </l>
            <l n="9.679"> Fulfilled, the hope accomplished; and thy praise </l>
            <l n="9.680"> Be sung with transport and unceasing joy. </l>
            <l n="9.681">   Once,” and with mild demeanour, as he spake, </l>
            <l n="9.682"> On us the venerable Pastor turned </l>
            <l n="9.683"> His beaming eye that had been raised to Heaven, </l>
            <l n="9.684"> “Once, while the Name, Jehovah, was a sound </l>
            <l n="9.685"> Within the circuit of this sea-girt isle </l>
            <l n="9.686"> Unheard, the savage nations bowed the head </l>
            <l n="9.687"> To Gods delighting in remorseless deeds; </l>
            <l n="9.688"> Gods which themselves had fashioned, to promote </l>
            <l n="9.689"> Ill purposes, and flatter foul desires. </l>
            <l n="9.690"> Then, in the bosom of yon mountain-cove, </l>
            <l n="9.691"> To those inventions of corrupted man </l>
            <l n="9.692"> Mysterious rites were solemnised; and there— </l>
            <l n="9.693"> Amid impending rocks and gloomy woods— </l>
            <l n="9.694"> Of those terrific Idols some received </l>
            <l n="9.695"> Such dismal service, that the loudest voice </l>
            <l n="9.696"> Of the swoln cataracts (which now are heard </l>
            <l n="9.697"> Soft murmuring) was too weak to overcome, </l>
            <l n="9.698"> Though aided by wild winds, the groans and shrieks </l>
            <l n="9.699"> Of human victims, offered up to appease </l>
            <l n="9.700"> Or to propitiate. And, if living eyes </l>
            <l n="9.701"> Had visionary faculties to see </l>
            <l n="9.702"> The thing that hath been as the thing that is, </l>
            <l n="9.703"> Aghast we might behold this crystal Mere </l>
            <l n="9.704"> Bedimmed with smoke, in wreaths voluminous, </l>
            <l n="9.705"> Flung from the body of devouring fires, </l>
            <l n="9.706"> To Taranis erected on the heights </l>
            <l n="9.707"> By priestly hands, for sacrifice performed </l>
            <l n="9.708"> Exultingly, in view of open day </l>
            <l n="9.709"> And full assemblage of a barbarous host; </l>
            <l n="9.710"> Or to Andates, female Power! who gave </l>
            <l n="9.711"> (For so they fancied) glorious victory. </l>
            <l n="9.712"> —A few rude monuments of mountain-stone </l>
            <l n="9.713"> Survive; all else is swept away.—How bright </l>
            <l n="9.714"> The appearances of things! From such, how changed </l>
            <l n="9.715"> The existing worship; and with those compared, </l>
            <l n="9.716"> The worshippers how innocent and blest! </l>
            <l n="9.717"> So wide the difference, a willing mind </l>
            <l n="9.718"> Might almost think, at this affecting hour, </l>
            <l n="9.719"> That paradise, the lost abode of man, </l>
            <l n="9.720"> Was raised again: and to a happy few, </l>
            <l n="9.721"> In its original beauty, here restored. </l>
            <l n="9.722">   Whence but from thee, the true and only God, </l>
            <l n="9.723"> And from the faith derived through Him who bled </l>
            <l n="9.724"> Upon the cross, this marvellous advance </l>
            <l n="9.725"> Of good from evil; as if one extreme </l>
            <l n="9.726"> Were left, the other gained.—O ye, who come </l>
            <l n="9.727"> To kneel devoutly in yon reverend Pile, </l>
            <l n="9.728"> Called to such office by the peaceful sound </l>
            <l n="9.729"> Of sabbath bells; and ye, who sleep in earth, </l>
            <l n="9.730"> All cares forgotten, round its hallowed walls! </l>
            <l n="9.731"> For you, in presence of this little band </l>
            <l n="9.732"> Gathered together on the green hill-side, </l>
            <l n="9.733"> Your Pastor is emboldened to prefer </l>
            <l n="9.734"> Vocal thanksgivings to the eternal King; </l>
            <l n="9.735"> Whose love, whose counsel, whose commands, have made </l>
            <l n="9.736"> Your very poorest rich in peace of thought </l>
            <l n="9.737"> And in good works; and him, who is endowed </l>
            <l n="9.738"> With scantiest knowledge, master of all truth </l>
            <l n="9.739"> Which the salvation of his soul requires. </l>
            <l n="9.740"> Conscious of that abundant favour showered </l>
            <l n="9.741"> On you, the children of my humble care, </l>
            <l n="9.742"> And this dear land, our country, while on earth </l>
            <l n="9.743"> We sojourn, have I lifted up my soul, </l>
            <l n="9.744"> Joy giving voice to fervent gratitude. </l>
            <l n="9.745"> These barren rocks, your stern inheritance; </l>
            <l n="9.746"> These fertile fields, that recompense your pains; </l>
            <l n="9.747"> The shadowy vale, the sunny mountain-top; </l>
            <l n="9.748"> Woods waving in the wind their lofty heads, </l>
            <l n="9.749"> Or hushed; the roaring waters and the still— </l>
            <l n="9.750"> They see the offering of my lifted hands, </l>
            <l n="9.751"> They hear my lips present their sacrifice, </l>
            <l n="9.752"> They know if I be silent, morn or even: </l>
            <l n="9.753"> For, though in whispers speaking, the full heart </l>
            <l n="9.754"> Will find a vent; and thought is praise to him, </l>
            <l n="9.755"> Audible praise, to thee, omniscient Mind, </l>
            <l n="9.756"> From whom all gifts descend, all blessings flow!” </l>
            <l n="9.757">   This vesper-service closed, without delay, </l>
            <l n="9.758"> From that exalted station to the plain </l>
            <l n="9.759"> Descending, we pursued our homeward course, </l>
            <l n="9.760"> In mute composure, o'er the shadowy lake, </l>
            <l n="9.761"> Under a faded sky. No trace remained </l>
            <l n="9.762"> Of those celestial splendours; grey the vault— </l>
            <l n="9.763"> Pure, cloudless, ether; and the star of eve </l>
            <l n="9.764"> Was wanting; but inferior lights appeared </l>
            <l n="9.765"> Faintly, too faint almost for sight; and some </l>
            <l n="9.766"> Above the darkened hills stood boldly forth </l>
            <l n="9.767"> In twinkling lustre, ere the boat attained </l>
            <l n="9.768"> Her mooring-place; where, to the sheltering tree, </l>
            <l n="9.769"> Our youthful Voyagers bound fast her prow, </l>
            <l n="9.770"> With prompt yet careful hands. This done, we paced </l>
            <l n="9.771"> The dewy fields; but ere the Vicar's door </l>
            <l n="9.772"> Was reached, the Solitary checked his steps; </l>
            <l n="9.773"> Then, intermingling thanks, on each bestowed </l>
            <l n="9.774"> A farewell salutation; and, the like </l>
            <l n="9.775"> Receiving, took the slender path that leads </l>
            <l n="9.776"> To the one cottage in the lonely dell: </l>
            <l n="9.777"> But turned not without welcome promise made </l>
            <l n="9.778"> That he would share the pleasures and pursuits </l>
            <l n="9.779"> Of yet another summer's day, not loth </l>
            <l n="9.780"> To wander with us through the fertile vales, </l>
            <l n="9.781"> And o'er the mountain-wastes. “Another sun,” </l>
            <l n="9.782"> Said he, “shall shine upon us, ere we part; </l>
            <l n="9.783"> Another sun, and peradventure more; </l>
            <l n="9.784"> If time, with free consent, be yours to give, </l>
            <l n="9.785"> And season favours.” </l>
            <l n="9.786">                       To enfeebled Power, </l>
            <l n="9.787"> From this communion with uninjured Minds, </l>
            <l n="9.788"> What renovation had been brought; and what </l>
            <l n="9.789"> Degree of healing to a wounded spirit, </l>
            <l n="9.790"> Dejected, and habitually disposed </l>
            <l n="9.791"> To seek, in degradation of the Kind, </l>
            <l n="9.792"> Excuse and solace for her own defects; </l>
            <l n="9.793"> How far those erring notions were reformed; </l>
            <l n="9.794"> And whether aught, of tendency as good </l>
            <l n="9.795"> And pure, from further intercourse ensued; </l>
            <l n="9.796"> This—if delightful hopes, as heretofore, </l>
            <l n="9.797"> Inspire the serious song, and gentle Hearts </l>
            <l n="9.798"> Cherish, and lofty Minds approve the past— </l>
            <l n="9.799"> My future labours may not leave untold. </l>
            <l n="9.800">                                                1795-1814. </l>
