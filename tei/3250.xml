            <head>Sappho and Phaon  --  Preface.</head>
            <p>IT must strike every admirer of poetical compositions, that the
modern sonnet, concluding with two lines, winding up the sentiment
of the whole, confines the poet's fancy, and frequently occasions an
abrupt termination of a beautiful and interesting picture; and that the
ancient, or what is generally denominated, the LEGITIMATE
SONNET, may be carried on in a series of sketches, composing, in
parts, one historical or imaginary subject, and forming in the whole a
complete and connected story.</p>
            <p>With this idea, I have ventured to compose the following<pb n="6"/>
collection; not presuming to offer them 
	as imitations of PETRARCH,
	but as specimens of that species of sonnet writing, so seldom
	attempted in the English language; though adopted by that sublime
	Bard, whose Muse produced the grand epic of Paradise Lost, and the
	humbler effusion, which I produce as an example of the measure to
	which I allude, and which is termed by the most classical writers, the
legitimate sonnet.</p>
            <lg type="poem">
               <l>O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray</l>
               <l>  Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,</l>
               <l>  Thou with fresh hope the lover's heart dost fill,</l>
               <l>While the jolly hours lead on propitious May.</l>
               <l>Thy liquid notes that close the eye of day</l>
               <l>  First heard before the shallow cuccoo's bill,</l>
               <l>  Portend succes in love; O if Jove's will</l>
               <l>Have link'd that amorous power to thy soft lay,</l>
               <l>  Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate</l>
               <l>Foretel my hopeless doom in some grove nigh,</l>
               <l>  As thou from year to year hast sung too late</l>
               <l>For my relief, yet hadst no reason why:</l>
               <l>  Whether the Muse, or Love call thee his mate,</l>
               <l>Both them I serve, and of their train am I.</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>To enumerate the variety of authors who have written sonnets of
all descriptions, would be endless; indeed few of them deserve notice:
and where, among the heterogeneous mass of insipid and laboured
efforts, sometimes a bright gem sheds lustre on the page of poesy, it
scarcely excites attention, owing to the disrepute in which sonnets are
fallen. So little is rule attended to by many, who profess the art of
poetry, that I have seen a composition of more than thirty lines,
ushered into the world under the name of Sonnet, and that, from the
pen of a writer, whose classical taste ought to have avoided such a
misnomer.</p>
            <p>Doctor Johnson describes a Sonnet, as "a short poem, consisting
of fourteen lines, of which the rhymes are adjusted by a particular
rule." He further adds, "It has not been used by any man of eminence
since MILTON." <pb n="8"/>
Sensible of the extreme difficulty I shall have to
encounter, in offering to the world a little wreath, <pb n="9"/>
wreath, gathered in that
path, which, even the best poets have thought it dangerous to tread;
and knowing that the English language is, of all others, the least
congenial to such an undertaking, (for, I believe, that the construction
of this kind of sonnet was originally in the Italian, where the vowels
are used almost every other letter,) I only point out the track where
more able pens may follow with success; and where the most classical
beauties may be adopted, and drawn forth with peculiar
advantage.</p>
            <p>Sophisticated sonnets are so common, for every rhapsody of
rhyme, from six lines to sixty comes under that denomination, that the
eye frequently turns from this species of poem with disgust. Every
school-boy, every romantic scribbler, thinks a sonnet a task of little
difficulty. From this ignorance <pb n="10"/>
in some, and vanity in others, we see
the monthly and diurnal publications abounding with ballads, odes,
elegies, epitaphs, and allegories, the non-descript ephemera from the
heated brains of self-important poetasters, all ushered into notice
under the appellation of SONNET!</p>
            <p>I confess myself such an enthusiastic votary of the Muse, that
any innovation which seems to threaten even the least of her
established rights, makes me tremble, lest that chaos of dissipated
pursuits which has too long been growing like an overwhelming
shadow, and menacing the lustre of intellectual light, should, aided
by the idleness of some, and the profligacy of others, at last obscure
the finer mental powers, and reduce the dignity of talents to the
lowest degradation.</p>
            <p>As poetry has the power to raise, so has it also the magic to
refine. The ancients considered the <pb n="11"/>
art of such importance, that
before they led forth their heroes to the most glorious enterprizes,
they animated them by the recital of grand and harmonious
compositions. The wisest scrupled not to reverence the invocations of
minds, graced with the charm of numbers: so mystically fraught are
powers said to be, which look beyond the surface of events, that an
admired and classical writer, describing the inspirations of the MUSE,
thus expresses his opinion:</p>
            <lg type="poem">
               <l> So when remote futurity is brought</l>
               <l> Before the keen inquiry of her thought,</l>
               <l> A terrible sagacity informs</l>
               <l> The Poet's heart, he looks to distant storms, </l>
               <l> He hears the thunder ere the tempest low'rs,</l>
               <l> And, arm'd with strength surpassing human pow'rs,</l>
               <l> Seizes events as yet unknown to man,</l>
               <l> And darts his soul into the dawning plan.</l>
               <l> Hence in a Roman mouth the graceful name</l>
               <l> Of Prophet and of Poet was the same,</l>
               <l> Hence British poets too the priesthood shar'd,</l>
               <l> And ev'ry hallow'd druid -- was a bard."</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>That poetry ought to be cherished as a national ornament,
cannot be more strongly exemplified than in the simple fact, that, in
those centuries when the poets' laurels have been most generously
fostered in Britain, the minds and manners of the natives have been
most polished and enlightened. Even the language of a country
refines into purity by the elegance of numbers: the strains of
WALLER have done more to effect that, then all the labours of
monkish pedantry, since the days of druidical mystery and
superstition.</p>
            <p>Though different minds are variously affected by the infinite
diversity of harmonious effusions, there are, I believe, very few that
are wholly insensible to the powers of poetic compositions. Cold must
that bosom be, which can resist the magical versification of Eloisa to
Abelard; and torpid to all the more exalted sensations of the soul is
that being, whose ear is not delighted by the <pb n="13"/>
grand and sublime
effusions of the divine Milton! The romantic chivalry of Spencer
vivifies the imagination; while the plaintive sweetness of Collins
soothes and penetrates the heart. How much would Britain have been
defecit in a comparison with other countries on the scale of
intellectual grace, had these poets never existed! yet it is a
melancholy truth, that here, where the attributes of genius have been
diffused by the liberal hand of nature, almost to prodigality, there has
not been, during a long series of years, the smallest mark of public
distinction bestowed on literary talents. Many individuals, whose
works are held in the highest estimation, now that their
ashes sleep in the sepulchre, were, when living, suffered to languish,
and even to perish, in obscure poverty: as if it were the peculiar fate
of genius, to be neglected while existing, and only honoured when the
consciousness of inspiration is vanished for ever.</p>
            <pb n="14"/>
            <p>The ingenious mechanic has the gratification of seeing his
labours patronized, and is rewarded for his invention while he has the
powers of enjoying its produce.  But the Poet's life is one perpetual
scene of warfare: he is assailed by envy, stung by malice, and
wounded by the fastidious comments of concealed assassins. The
more eminently beautiful his compositions are, the larger is the
phalanx he has to encounter; for the enemies of genius are
multitudinous.</p>
            <p>It is the interest of the ignorant and powerful, to suppress the
effusions of enlightened minds: when only monks could write, and
nobles read, authority rose triumphant over fright; and the slave,
spell-bound in ignorance, hugged his fetters without repining. It was
then that the best powers of reason lay buried like the gem in the
dark mine; by a slow and tedious progress they have been drawn
forth, and must, ere long, diffuse an universal <pb n="115"/>
lustre: for that era is
rapidly advancing, when talents will tower like an unperishable
column, while the globe will be strewed with the wrecks of
superstition.</p>
            <p>As it was the opinion of the ancients, that poets possessed the
powers of prophecy, the name was consequently held in the most
unbounded veneration. In less remote periods the bard has been
publicly distinguished; princes and priests have bowed before the
majesty of genius: Petrarch was crowned with laurels, the noblest
diadem, in the Capitol of Rome: his admirers were liberal, his 
contemporaries were just; and his name will stand upon record, with
the united and honourable testimony of his own talents, and the
generosity of his country.</p>
            <p>It is at once a melancholy truth, and a national disgrace, that
this Island, so profusely favored by<pb n="16"/>
nature, should be marked, of all
enlightened countries, as the most neglectful of literary merit! and I
will venture to believe, that there are both POETS and
PHILOSOPHERS, now living in Britain, who, had they been born in
any other clime, would have been honoured with the proudest
distinctions, and immortalized to the latest posterity.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude these opinions without paying tribute to the
talents of my illustrious country-women; who, unpatronized by the
courts, and unprotected by the powerful, persevere in the paths of
literature, and ennoble themselves by the unperishable lustre of
MENTAL PRE-EMINENCE!</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>The story of the <hi>LESBIAN MUSE</hi>, though not new to
the classical reader, presented to my imagination such a lively
example of the human mind, enlightened by the most exquisite
talents, yet yielding to the destructive controul of ungovernable
passions, that I felt an irresistible impulse to attempt the delineation
of their progress; mingling with the glowing picture of her soul, such
moral reflections, as may serve to exite that pity, which, while it
proves the susceptibility of the heart, arms it against the danger of
indulging too luxuriant fancy.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate lovers, Heloise and Abelard; and, the supposed
platonic, Petrarch and Laura, have <pb n="18"/>
found panegyrists in many
distinguished authors.  <hi>OVID</hi> and <hi>POPE</hi> have
celebrated the passion of Sappho for Phaon; but their portraits,
however beautifully finished, are replete with shades, tending rather
to depreciate than to adorn the Grecian Poetess.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to collect, in the succeeding pages, the
mostliberal accounts of that illustrious woman, whose fame has
transmitted to us some fragments of her works, through many dark
ages, and for the space of more than two thousand years.  The merit
of her compositions must have been indisputable, to have left all
cotemporary female writers in obscurity; for it is known, that poetry
was, at the period in which she lived, held in the most sacred
veneration; and that those who were gifted with that divine
inspiration, were ranked as the first class of human
beings.</p>
            <p>Among the many Grecian writers, Sappho was the unrivalled
poetess of her time: the envy she excited, <pb n="19"/>
the public honours she
received, and the fatal passion which terminated her existence, will, I
trust, create that sympathy in the mind of the susceptible reader,
which may render the following poetical trifles not wholly
uninteresting.</p>

            <head>ACCOUNT OF SAPPHO.</head>
            <p>SAPPHO, whom the ancients distinguished by the title of the
TENTH MUSE, was born at Mytilene in the island of Lesbos, six
hundred years before the Christian era. As no particulars have been
transmitted to posterity, respecting the origin of her family, it is most
likely she derived by little consequence from birth of connection. At
an early period of her life she was wedded to Cercolus, a native
of the isle of Andros; he was possessed of considerable wealth, and
though the Lesbian Muse is said to have been sparingly gifted with<pb n="22"/>
beauty, he became enamoured of her, more perhaps on account of
mental, than personal charms. By this union she is said to have given
birth to a daughter; but Cercolus leaving her, while young, in a state
of widowhood, she never after could be prevailed on to marry.</p>
            <p>The Fame which her genius spread even to the remotest parts of
the earth, excited the envy of some writers who endeavoured to throw
over her private character, a shade, which shrunk before the brilliancy
of her poetical talents. Her soul was replete with harmony, that
harmony which neither art nor study can acquire; she felt the intuitive
superiority, and to the Muses she paid unbounded adoration.</p>
            <p>The Mytilenians held her poetry in such high veneration, and
were so sensible of the hour conferred on the country which gave her
birth, that <pb n="23"/>
they coined money with the impression of her head; and at
the time of her death, paid tribute to their memory, such as was
offered to sovereigns only.</p>
            <p>The story of Antiochus has been related as an unequivocal proof
of Sappho's skill in discovering, and powers of describing the passions
of the human mind.  That prince is said to have entertained a fatal
affection for his mother-in-law Stratonice; which, though he
endeavoured to subdue it's influence, preyed upon his frame, and
after many ineffectual struggles, at length reduced him to extreme
danger. His physicians marked the symptoms attending his malady,
and found them so exactly correspond with Sappho's delineation of
the tender passion, that they did not hesitate to form a decisive
opinion of the cause, which had produced so perilous an effect.</p>
            <pb n="24"/>
            <p>That Sappho was not insensible to the feelings she so well
described , is evident in her writings but it was scarcely possible, that
a mind so exquisitely tender, so sublimely gifted, should escape those
fascinations which even apathy itself has been awakened to
acknowledge.</p>
            <p>The scarce specimens now extant, from the pen of the Grecian
Muse, have by the most competent judges been esteemed as the
standard for the pathetic, the glowing, and the amatory. The ode,
which has been so highly estimated, is written in a measure
distinguished by the title of the Sapphic. POPE made it his model in
his juvenile production, beginning -- </p>
            <l>"Happy the man -- whose wish and care" --</l>
            <p>Addison was of opinion, that the writings of Sappho were replete
with such fascinating beauties, and adorned with such a vivid glow of
sensibility, <pb n="25"/>
that, probably, had they been preserved entire, it would
have been dangerous to have perused them. They possessed none of
the artificial decorations of a feigned passion; they were the genuine
effusions of a supremely enlightened soul, laboring to subdue a fatal
enchantment; and vainly opposing the conscious pride of illustrious
fame, against the warm susceptibility of a generous bosom.</p>
            <p>Though few stanzas from the pen of the Lesbian poetess have
darted through the shades of oblivion: yet, those that remain are so
exquisitely touching and beautiful, that they prove beyond dispute the
taste, feeling, and inspiration of the mind which produced them. In
examining the curiosities of antiquity, we look to the perfections,
and not the magnitude of those relics, which have been preserved
amidst the wrecks of time: as the smallest gem that bears the fine
touches of a master, surpasses the loftiest fabric reared by the <pb n="26"/>
labours of false taste, so the precious fragments of the immortal Sappho, 
will be admired, when the voluminous productions of inferior poets are
mouldered into dust. </p>
            <p>When it is considered, that the few specimens we have of the
poems of the Grecian Muse, have passed through three and twenty
centuries, and consequently through the hands of innumerable
translators: and when it is known that Envy frequently delights in the
base occupation of depreciating merit which it cannot aspire to
emulate; it may be conjectured, that some passages are erroneously
given to posterity, either by ignorance or design. Sappho, whose fame
beamed round her with the superior effulgence which her works had
created, knew that she was writing for future ages; it is not therefore
natural that she should produce any composition which might tend to
tarnish her reputation, or lessen that celebrity <pb n="27"/>
which it was the labour
of her life to consecrate. The delicacy of her sentiments cannot find a
more eloquent advocate than in her own effusions; she is said to have
commended in the most animated panegyric, the virtues of her
brother Lanychus; and with the most pointed and severe censure, to
have contemned the passion which her prother Charaxus entertained
for the beautiful Rhodope. If her writings were, in some instances,
too glowing for the fastidious refinement of modern times;
let it be her excuse, and the honour of her country, that the liberal
education of the Greeks was such, as inspired them with an
unprejudiced enthusiasm for the works of genius: and that when they
paid adoration to Sappho, they idolized the MUSE, and not the
WOMAN. </p>
            <p>I shall conclude this account with an extract from the works of
the learned and enlightened Abbe' Barthelemi; at once the
vindication and eulogy of the Grecian Poetess.</p>
            <pb n="28"/>
            <p>"Sappho undertook to inspire the Lesbian women with a taste
for literature; many of them received instructions from her, and
foreign women increased the number of her disciples. She loved them
to excess, because it was impossible for her to love otherwise; and she
expressed her tenderness in all the violence of passion: your
surprize at this will cease, when you are acquainted with the extreme
sensibility of the Greeks; and discover, that amongst them the most
innocent connections often borrow the impassioned language of
love.</p>
            <p>"A certain facility of manners, she possessed; and the warmth of
her expressions were but too well calculated to expose her to the
hatred of some women of distinction, humbled by her superiority; and
the jealousy of some of her disciples, who happened to be the objects
of her preference. To this hatred she replied <pb n="29"/>
by truths and irony,
which completely exasperated her enemies. She repaired to Sicily,
where a statue was erected to her; it was sculptured by SILANION,
one of the most celebrated staturists of his time. The sensibility of
SAPPHO was extreme! she loved PHAON, who forsook her; after
various efforts to bring him back, she took the leap of <hi>Leucata</hi>, and perished in the waves!</p>
            <p>"Death has not obliterated the stain imprinted on her character;
for ENVY, which fastens on ILLUSTRIOUS NAMES, does not
expire; but <pb n="30"/>
