            <head>LONDON: A POEM, <lb/>In Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal.<lb/>By Mr. Samuel Johnson.

               <emph>â€” quis ineptae</emph>
            </head>
            <l>Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se?</l>
            <l n="1">  Juv.</l>
            <l>Tho' grief and fondness in my breast rebel,</l>
            <l>When injur'd THALES bids the town farewell,</l>
            <l>Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend,</l>
            <l>I praise the hermit, but regret the friend,</l>
            <l>Who now resolves, from vice and LONDN far,</l>
            <l>To breathe in distant fields a purer air,</l>
            <l>And, fix'd on Cambria's solitary shore,</l>
            <l>Give to St. David one true Briton more.</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="102"/>
            <l>For who would leave, unbrib'd, Hibernia's land,</l>
            <l>Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand?</l>
            <l>There none are swept by sudden fate away,</l>
            <l>But all whom hunger spares, with age decay:</l>
            <l>Here malice, rapine, accident, conspire,</l>
            <l>And now a rabble rages, now a fire;</l>
            <l>Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay,</l>
            <l>Here falling houses thunder on your head</l>
            <l>And here a female atheist talks you dead.</l>
            <l>While THALES waits the wherry that contains</l>
            <l>Of dissipated wealth the small remains,</l>
            <l>On Thames's banks, in silent thought we stood,</l>
            <l>Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood:</l>
            <l>Struck with the seat that gave Eliza birth,</l>
            <l>We kneel, and kiss the consecrated earth;</l>
            <l>In pleasing dreams the blissful age renew,</l>
            <l>And call Britannia's glories back to view;</l>
            <l>Behold her cross triumphant on the main,</l>
            <l>The guard of commerce, and the dread of Spain,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="103"/>
            <l>Ere masquerades debauch'd, excise oppress'd,</l>
            <l>Or English honour grew a standing jest.</l>
            <l>A transient calm the happy scenes bestow,</l>
            <l>And for a moment lull the sense of woe.</l>
            <l>At length awaking, with contemptuous frown.</l>
            <l>Indignant THALES eyes the neighb'ring town.</l>
            <l>Wants ev'n the cheap reward of empty praise;</l>
            <l>In those curst walls, devote to vice and gain,</l>
            <l>Since unrewarded science toils in vain;</l>
            <l>Since hope but sooths to double my distress,</l>
            <l>And ev'ry moment leaves my little less;</l>
            <l>While yet my steddy steps no staff sustains,</l>
            <l>And life still vig'rous revels in my veins;</l>
            <l>Grant me, kind heaven, to find some happier place,</l>
            <l>Where honesty and sense are no disgrace;</l>
            <l>Some pleasing bank where verdant osiers play,</l>
            <l>Some peaceful vale with nature's paintings gay;</l>
            <l>Where once the harrass'd Briton found repose,</l>
            <l>And safe in poverty defy'd his foes;</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="104"/>
            <l>Some secret cell, ye pow'rs, indulgent give.</l>
            <l>Let--live here, for--has learn'd to live.</l>
            <l>Here let those reign, whom pensions can incite</l>
            <l>To vote a patriot black, a courtier white;</l>
            <l>Explain their country's dear-bought rights away,</l>
            <l>And plead for pirates in the face of day;</l>
            <l>With slavish tenets taint our poison'd youth,</l>
            <l>And lend a lye the confidence of truth.</l>
            <l>Let such raise palaces, and manors buy,</l>
            <l>Collect a tax, or farm a lottery,</l>
            <l>With warbling eunuchs fill a licens'd stage,</l>
            <l>And lull to servitude a thoughtless age.</l>
            <l>Heroes, proceed! what bounds your pride shall hold?</l>
            <l>What check restrain your thirst of pow'r and gold?</l>
            <l>Behold rebellious virtue quite o'erthrown,</l>
            <l>Behold our fame, our wealth, our lives your own.</l>
            <l>To such, a groaning nation's spoils are giv'n,</l>
            <l>When publick crimes inflame the wrath of heav'n:</l>
            <l>But what, my friend, what hope remains for me,</l>
            <l>Who start at theft, and blush at perjury?</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="105"/>
            <l>Who scarce forbear, tho'BRITAIN's Court he sing,</l>
            <l>To pluck a titled Poet's borrow'd wing;</l>
            <l>A Statesman's logic unconvinc'd can hear,</l>
            <l>And dare to slumber o'er the Gazetteer;</l>
            <l>Despise a fool in half his pension drest,</l>
            <l>And strive in vain to laugh at H----y's jest.</l>
            <l>Can sap the principles, or taint the heart;</l>
            <l>With more address a lover's note convey,</l>
            <l>Or bribe a virgin's innocence away.</l>
            <l>Well may they rise, while I, whose rustic tongue</l>
            <l>Ne'er knew to puzzle right, or varnish wrong,</l>
            <l>Spurn'd as a begger, dreaded as a spy,</l>
            <l>Live unregarded, unlamented die.</l>
            <l>For what but social guilt the friend endears?</l>
            <l>Who shares Orgilio's crimes, his fortune shares.</l>
            <l>Bu,t thou  should tempting villainy present</l>
            <l>All Marlb'rough hoarded, or all Villiers spent,</l>
            <l>Turn from the glitt'ring bribe thy scornful eye,</l>
            <l>Nor sell for gold, what gold could never buy,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="106"/>
            <l>The peaceful slumber, self-approving day,</l>
            <l>Unsullied fame, and conscience ever gay.</l>
            <l>The cheated nation's happy fav'rites, see!</l>
            <l>Mark whom the great caress, who frown on me!</l>
            <l>LONDON! the needy villain's gen'ral home,</l>
            <l>The common shore of Paris and of Rome;</l>
            <l>With eager thirst, by folly or by fate,</l>
            <l>Sucks in the dregs of each corrupted state.</l>
            <l>Forgive my transports on a theme like this,</l>
            <l>I cannot bear a French metropolis.</l>
            <l>Illustrious EDWARD! from the realms of day,</l>
            <l>The land of heroes and saints survey;</l>
            <l>Nor hope the British lineaments to trace,</l>
            <l>The rustic grandeur, or the surly grace,</l>
            <l>But soft in thoughtless ease, and empty show,</l>
            <l>Behold the warrior dwindled to a beau ;</l>
            <l>Sense, freedom, piety, refin'd away,</l>
            <l>Of France the mimic, and of Spain the prey.</l>
            <l>All that at home no more can beg or steal,</l>
            <l>Or like a gibbet better than a wheel;</l>
            <l>Hiss'd from the stage, or hooted from the court,</l>
            <l>Their air, their dress, their politicks import;</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="107"/>
            <l>Obsequious, artful, voluble and gay,</l>
            <l>On Britain's fond credulity they prey.</l>
            <l>No gainful trade their industry can 'scape,</l>
            <l>They sing, they dance, clean shoes, or cure a clap;</l>
            <l>All sciences a fasting Monsieur knows,</l>
            <l>Ah! what avails it, that, from slav'ry far,</l>
            <l>I drew the breath of life in English air;</l>
            <l>Was early taught a Briton's right to prize,</l>
            <l>And lisp the tale of HENRY's victories;</l>
            <l>If the gull'd conqueror receives the chain,</l>
            <l>And flattery subdues when arms are vain.</l>
            <l>Studious to please, and ready to submit,</l>
            <l>The supple Gaul was born a parasite:</l>
            <l>Still to his int'rest true, where'er he goes.</l>
            <l>Wit, brav'ry, worth, his lavish tongue bestows;</l>
            <l>In ev'ry face a thousand graces shine,</l>
            <l>From ev'ry tongue flows harmony divine.</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="108"/>
            <l>These arts in vain our rugged natives try,</l>
            <l>Strain out with fault'ring diffidence a lie,</l>
            <l>And gain a kick for aukward flattery.</l>
            <l>Besides, with justice, this discerning age</l>
            <l>Admires their wond'rous talents for the stage:</l>
            <l>Well may they venture on the mimic's art,</l>
            <l>Who play from morn to night a borrow'd part;</l>
            <l>Practis'd their master's notions to embrace,</l>
            <l>Repeat his maxims, and reflect his face;</l>
            <l>With ev'ry wild absurdity comply,</l>
            <l>And view each object with another's eye;</l>
            <l>To shake with laughter ere the jest they hear,</l>
            <l>To pour at will the counterfeited tear,</l>
            <l>And as their patron hints the cold or heat,</l>
            <l>To shake in dog-days, in December sweat.</l>
            <l>How, when competitors like these contend,</l>
            <l>Can surly virtue hope to fix a friend?</l>
            <l>Slaves that with serious impudence beguile,</l>
            <l>And lye without a blush, without a smile;</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="109"/>
            <l>Exalt each trifle, ev'ry vice adore,</l>
            <l>Your taste in snuff, your judgment in a whore;</l>
            <l>Can Balbo's eloquence applaud, and swear</l>
            <l>He gropes his breeches with a monarch's air.</l>
            <l>For arts like these preferr'd, admir'd, carest,</l>
            <l>They first invade your table, then your breast;</l>
            <l>Explore your secrets with insidious art,</l>
            <l>Watch the weak hour, and ransack all the heart;</l>
            <l>Then soon your ill-plac'd confidence repay,</l>
            <l>By numbers here from shame or censure free,</l>
            <l>All crimes are safe, but hated poverty.</l>
            <l>This, only this, the rigid law pursues,</l>
            <l>This, only this, provokes the snarling muse.</l>
            <l>The  sober trader at a tatter'd cloak,</l>
            <l>Wakes from his dream, and labours for a joke;</l>
            <l>With brisker air the silken courtiers gaze,</l>
            <l>And turn the varied taunt a thousand ways.</l>
            <l>Of all the griefs that harrass the distrest,</l>
            <l>Sure the most bitter is a scornful jest;</l>
            <l>Fate never wounds more deep the gen'rous heart,</l>
            <l>Than when a blockhead's insult points the dart.</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="110"/>
            <l>Has heaven reserv'd, in pity to the poor,</l>
            <l>No pathless waste, or undiscover'd shore;</l>
            <l>No peaceful desart yet unclaim'd by SPAIN?</l>
            <l>Quick let us rise, the happy seats explore,</l>
            <l>And bear oppression's insolence no more.</l>
            <l>This mournful truth is ev'ry where consest,</l>
            <l>SLOW RISES WORTH, BY POVERTY DEPREST:</l>
            <l>But here more slow, where all are slaves to gold,</l>
            <l>Where looks are merchandise, and smiles are sold;</l>
            <l>Where won by bribes, by flatteries implor'd,</l>
            <l>The groom retails the favours of his lord.</l>
            <l>But hark! th'affrighted croud's tumultuous cries</l>
            <l>Roll thro' the streets, and thunder to the skies;</l>
            <l>Rais'd from some pleasing dream of wealth and pow'r,</l>
            <l>Some pompous palace, or some blissful bow'r</l>
            <l>Aghast you start, and scarce with aking sight</l>

            <l>Swift from pursuing horrors take your way,</l>
            <l>And leave your little all to flames a prey;</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="111"/>
            <l>Then thro' the world a wretched vagrant roam,</l>
            <l>For where can starving merit find a home?</l>
            <l>In vain your mournful narrative disclose,</l>
            <l>While all neglect, and most insult your woes.</l>
            <l>Should heaven's just bolts Orgilio's wealth confound</l>
            <l>And spread his flaming palace on the ground,</l>
            <l>Swift o'er the land the dismal rumour flies,</l>

            <l>His fall was destin'd to a barren strand,</l>
            <l>A petty fortress, and a dubious hand;</l>
            <l>He left the name, at which the world grew pale,</l>
            <l>To point a moral, or adorn a tale.</l>

            <l>In gay hostility, and barb'rous pride,</l>
            <l>With half mankind embattled at his side,</l>
            <l>Great Xerxes comes to seize the certain prey,</l>
            <l>And starves exhausted regions in his way;</l>
            <l>Attendant Flatt'ry counts his myriads o'er,</l>

            <l>Fresh praise is try'd till madness fires his mind,</l>

            <l>New pow'rs are claim'd, new pow'rs are still bestow'd,</l>
            <l>Till rude resistance lops the spreading god;</l>
            <l>The daring Greeks deride the martial show,</l>
            <l>And heap their vallies with the gaudy foe;</l>
            <l>Th'insulted sea with humbler thoughts he gains,</l>

            <l>Short sway! fair Austria spreads her mournful charms,</l>

            <l>From hill to hill the beacons rousing blaze</l>

            <l>The baffled prince in honour's flatt'ring bloom</l>

            <l>His foes derision, and his subjects blame,</l>

            <l>In health, in sickness, thus the suppliant prays;</l>

            <l>Time hovers o'er impatient to destroy,</l>
            <l>And shuts up all the passages of joy:</l>
            <l>In vain their gifts the bounteous seasons pour,</l>
            <l>The fruit autumnal, and the vernal flow'r,</l>
            <l>With listless eyes the dotard views the shore,</l>

            <l>The watchful guests still hint the last offence,</l>

            <l>An age that melts in unperceiv'd decay,</l>

            <l>Whose night congratulating Conscience cheers;</l>
            <l>The gen'ral fav'rite as the gen'ral friend:</l>

            <l>Yet e'n on this her load Misfortune slings,</l>
            <l>To press the weary minutes flagging wings:</l>
            <l>New sorrow rises as the day returns,</l>
            <l>A sister sickens, or a daughter mourns.</l>

            <l>Year chases year, decay pursues decay,</l>
            <l>Still drops some joy from with'ring life away;</l>
            <l>New forms arise, and diff'rent views engage,</l>
            <l>Superfluous lags the vet'ran on the stage</l>
            <l>Till pitying Nature signs the last release,</l>
            <l>And bids afflicted worth retire to peace.</l>
            <l>But few there are whom hours like these await,</l>

            <l>From Lydia's monarch should the search descend,</l>

            <l>What care, what rules your heedless charms shall save,</l>

            <l>Against your fame with fondness hate combines,</l>
            <l>The rival batters, and the lover mines.</l>
            <l>With distant voice neglected Virtue calls,</l>
            <l>Less heard and less, the saint remonstrance falls;</l>
            <l>Tir'd with contempt, she quits the slipp'ry reign,</l>
