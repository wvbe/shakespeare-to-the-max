            <head>TO<lb/>
Mrs. ARABELLA FERMOUR.</head>
            <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            <p>
               <lb/>It will be in vain to<lb/>
deny that I have some<lb/>
value for this piece,<lb/>
since I dedicate it to<lb/>
you. Yet you may<lb/>
bear me witness, it<lb/>
was intended only to divert a few young <pb n="sig: A2 cw:Ladies"/>
               <lb/>
Ladies, who have good sense and good<lb/>
Humour enough, to laugh not only at<lb/>
their sex's little unguarded Follies, but at<lb/>
their own. But as it was communicated<lb/>
with the Air of a Secret, it soon found its<lb/>
Way into the World. An imperfect<lb/>
Copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller,<lb/>
You had the Good-Nature for my Sake<lb/>
to consent to the publication of one<lb/>
more correct: This I was forc'd to be-<lb/>
fore I had executed half my Design, for<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Machinery</hi> was entirely wanting to<lb/>
compleat it.</p>
            <p>
               <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Machinery</hi> Madam, is a Term<lb/>
invented by the Critiks, to signify that <lb/>
Part which the Deities, Angels, or Dæ-<lb/>
mons, are made to act in a poem: For<lb/>
the ancient Poets are in one respect like<pb n="cw: many"/>
               <lb/>
many modern Ladies; Let an Action be<lb/>
never so trivial in it self, they always<lb/>
make it appear of the utmost Impor-<lb/>
tance. These Machines I determin'd to <lb/>
raise on a very new and odd Foundation,<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Rosicrucian</hi> Doctrine of Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <lb/>I know how disagreeable it is to make<lb/>
use of hard Words before a Lady; but<lb/>
'tis so much the Concern of a Poet to<lb/>
have his Works understood, and particu-<lb/>
larly by your Sex, that You must give me <lb/>
leave to explain two or three difficult<lb/>
Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Rosicrucians</hi> are the People I must<lb/>
bring You acquainted with. The best<lb/>
Account I know of them is in the French<lb/>
Book call'd <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fre">Le Comte de Gabalis,</foreign> which<pb n="cw:both"/>
               <lb/>
both in its Title and Size is so like a<lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Novel,</hi> that many of the fair Sex have<lb/>
read it for one by Mistake. According<lb/>
to these Gentlemen, the four Elements<lb/>
are inhabited by Spirits, which they call<lb/>
               <hi rend="italic">Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Salamanders.</hi>
               <lb/>
The <hi rend="italic">Gnomes,</hi> or Dæmons of Earth, de-<lb/>
light in Mischief; but the <hi rend="italic">Sylphs,</hi> whose<lb/>
Habitation is Air, are the best-condition'd<lb/>
Creatures imaginable. For the say, any<lb/>
Mortals may enjoy the most intimate Fa-<lb/>
miliarities with these gentle Spirits, upon<lb/>
a Condition very easie to all true <hi rend="italic">Adepts,</hi>
               <lb/>
an involate Preservation of Chastity.</p>
            <p>
               <lb/>As to the following Canto's, all the<lb/>
Passages of them are as Fabulous, as the<lb/>
Vision at the beginning, or the Transfor- <lb/>
mation at the End; (except the Loss of<pb n="cw:your"/>
               <lb/>
your Hair, which I always mane with Re-<lb/>
verence.) The Human Persons are as Ficti-<lb/>
tious as the Airy ones; and the Character<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Belinda,</hi>as it is now manag'd, resem-<lb/>
bles You in nothing but in Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <lb/>If this Poem had as many Graces as<lb/>
there are in Your Person, or in Your Mind,<lb/>
yet I could never hope it should pass thro'<lb/>
the World half so Uncensured as You have<lb/>
done. But let its Fortune be what it will,<lb/>
mine is happy enough, to have given me<lb/>
this Occasion of assuring You that I am.<lb/>
with the truest Esteem,</p>
