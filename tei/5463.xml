               <l>OF all the Girls that are ſo ſmart,</l>
               <l>There's none like pretty Sally,</l>
               <l>She is the Darling of my Heart,</l>
               <l>And ſhe lives in our Alley.</l>
               <l>There is no Lady in the Land</l>
               <l>Is half ſo ſweet as Sally.</l>
               <l>She is the Darling of my Heart,</l>
               <l>And ſhe lives in our Alley.</l>
               <l>Her Father he makes Cabbage-Nets,</l>
               <l>And thro' the Steets does cry them.</l>
               <l>Her Mother ſhe ſells Laces long</l>
               <l>To thoſe that pleaſe to buy them.</l>
               <l>But ſure ſuch Folks could ne'er beget</l>
               <l>So ſweet a Girl as Sally,</l>
               <l>She is the Darling of my Heart,</l>
               <l>And ſhe lives in our alley.</l>
               <l>When ſhe is by, I leave my Work,</l>
               <l>I love her ſo ſincerely.</l>
               <l>My maſter comes like any Turk,</l>
               <l>And bangs me moſt ſeverely.</l>
               <l>But let him bang his Belly-full,</l>

               <l>My Maſter carries me to church,</l>
               <l>And often am I blamed,</l>
               <l>Becauſe I leave him in the lurch,</l>
               <l>As ſoon as Text is named.</l>
               <l>I leave the church in Sermon-time,</l>
               <l>And ſlink away to Sally,</l>

               <l>He walks ſo ſtately o'er the Ground,</l>

               <l>And for the Neighbours I don't care,</l>
               <l>We will live in our Alley.</l>
               <l>It's true, when Johnny comes along,</l>

               <l>When he doth kiſs and wooe me.</l>
               <l>Then in the Fields we walk and talk,</l>
               <l>He calls me deareſt Sally,</l>
               <l>I love him, and I'll have him too,</l>
