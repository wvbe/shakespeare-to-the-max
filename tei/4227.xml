            <head>LE TOCSIN!
OR THE ADDRESS OF
CITIZEN FAMINE!</head>
            <p>KINGS! Miniſters! Lords! Commons! and
Preſsgangs!—By whatever denomination
ye are known, Oh oppreſſors! drop for a moment
the clamour of Corruption, and hearken to the voice
of Truth.</p>
            <p>The paſt ages of the World have been the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochs
of theory, the preſent is an Age of practice,
Men begin to act what they formerly thought; an
unaccountable impulſe urges the Arm to perform
what the Heart dictates, and no ſooner is Tyranny
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0646000800:3"/>
known, than the unanimous conſent of Nations
records it for deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Beware, then; the arm of vengeance ſhall not be
torpid for ever! Man ſupports oppreſſion as long as
his prejudices enable him, but when the increaſing
Weight exceeds his ſtrength, prejudice takes itſelf
away, and the oppreſſion is tumbled to the earth;
you may make the Blind believe that there is no
Sun, or that it is not at preſent viſible; but you
cannot perſwade the awakened ſight of Reaſon that
it is only a Farthing candle, Ariſtocratically lighted
up, to illumine and benefit a few.</p>
            <p>When Bread is wanting, and when Men are ſcarce,
do not accuſe Nature with ſterility, do not libel
Humanity ſo much by aſſerting that deſtruction is
occaſioned by the neceſſities of ſociety; Society is
ſufficient for itſelf, it requires no aid, no Crowned
Auxiliary, and it cannot be the cauſe of War or
Miſery, unleſs ſome <hi>Extra</hi> Monarchy disjoints the
parts and diſunites the members. War is the cauſe
of Famine, and Courts are the authors of War, they
write the Hiſtory of man in letters of blood, and
Death is their Hiſtorian! they thin the ranks of
Life, they drive the Huſbandman from the plough
to the camp, and when Corn becomes ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the peaſants cannot cultivate it; they exclaim
Nature has denied her increaſe, and men ſlaughter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0646000800:4"/>
one another. Let us conſider for a moment, if
theſe things are true.</p>
            <p>While a Commercial intercourſe exiſts between
the Nations of the Earth, no ſcarcity can ariſe to
any nation, becauſe the ſuperfluity of one Country
will always ſupply the deficiency of another, this
commercial intercourſe can only be impeded by the
machinations of Tyrants! Tyrants are therefore the
cauſes of Famine. Oh! ye oppreſſors of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
have you not violated the ſacred rights of
ſocial commerce, and have you not by that means
provoked a reciprocal injuſtice. If it was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſend our Brothers by thouſands to their
graves, and to make the Fields of Flanders ſmoke
with the gore of our countrymen, ſurely it was an
unpardonable exceſs of cruely to invent a ſyſtem
of ſtarvation! at once to depopulate the earth, to
barrenize nature, and to invade thoſe ſacred rights
of commerce which have hitherto diſtributed the
effects of nature to all the Tenants of the Globe.</p>
            <p>Thro' you, deſtructive wolves, our children cry
in vain for that ſuſtenance, which the forſaken mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is unable to give them; Thro' your arts, the
laſt patience of human nature is exhauſted, and
while hunger impels the inſulted Sons of poverty to
deſperation, the ruffians of war, ſhoot them like
Dogs, and death finiſhes that long tale of lingering
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0646000800:5"/>
miſery, which you Tyrants firſt began: Heavens!
ſhall our exiſtence be prolonged, only to make our
ſufferings the medium of your proſperity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſhall our ſcanty meals, and hard-earned mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
ſcarcely keep together the laſt remnants of a
weary being, that you may wallow in Luxury, and
tread with inſolence upon the hands that feed you;
No! No! if humanity is to fall, let it fall the Heroe
of nature, and let the dagger of vengeance be the
trophy to celebrate the ſtruggles of expiring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and adorn the ſepulchre of virtue.</p>
            <p>This may be the language of paſſion, but it is alſo
the language of Truth; there are many truths diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to Statesmen, and none more ſo than,
thoſe which have an effect attatched to the non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of them; patience appears to me a virtue,
in proportion as avarice and ambition are German
vices; Hanover is the Fountain-head of purgation,
and Johnny Bull can evidence the effects of the
German Spa. However let us remember, that,
tho' it is the <hi>interest</hi> of Hanover to be the receiver
of Gold, it is not his <hi>interest</hi> to take away our
ſheaves of Corn, ſince in that caſe it may be our
<hi>interest</hi> to plant Hemp inſtead of Wheat.</p>
            <p>Inform me great and awfull Juſtice! which is
guilty, the Monarchs, Miniſters, and Prieſts who
adviſe deſtruction, and murder, and ſend our Corn
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0646000800:6"/>
and Cattle to feed the Whiſkered Slaves of Auſtria;
or the Peaſant, Mechanic, or Laborer, who impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Nature's appetites, ſnatches from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor
a morſel which they have not bought? who
great Juſtice! deſerves moſt to ſuffer from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Aſſaſſins of the day? Juſtice points to the
Crown, to the Robe of Office, and the Mitre,
The Spade, the Anvil and the Loom are greater
ornaments to life,—the Children of Nature uſe
them,—and whatever Nature produces, is their
Heritage and Right.</p>
            <p>It were well if your Red-coat Aſſaſſins would
ceaſe to murder for you, for then your Tyranny
would ceaſe to be. However the Soldier is not
the moſt faithful of your dogs, you feed him upon
hard Cruſts! No ſooner ſhall the People offer him
a better meal, then he will deſert from your stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
and unite with the People.—Already the army
is becomming enlightened; Gunpowder will ſoon
be a uſeleſs material, and the Soldier will ſhortly
be exalted from the ſtate of a Slave into a Man.—Beware
of that day when the Cap of Liberty ſhall
be ſupported by thoſe men, whom you now treat
as Slaves! it approaches, and Tyranny trembles
at the quickneſs of the ſtep! Tyranny and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have engaged in a race; Tyranny which at firſt
gained upon humanity, thro' the violence of its
progreſs, now grows weary, every nerve is exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0646000800:7"/>
and leaning on a broken Sword, it ſcarcely
pants along,—while Freedom a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mid the ſhouts of
Millions arives triumphant at the Goal.</p>
            <p>If this is not warning ſufficient to you, apply
your attention to the Vengeance which Public
miſery is preparing to ſhower on your heads, look
at the ſcenes of ſorrow and ſtarvation, of which you
are the cauſe, and ſee the victims of Famine, whom
you have deprived of Bread and Cheeſe, feaſting on
the ideas of future Juſtice.—Give them a Peace—Deſtroy
your Monopolies,—Reform your Senates,
Diſband your Aſſociations—Decline your Penſions,
and then hoping for better days, the inſulted World
may relax its ſeverity, and by comforting the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of others, you may perpetuate your own.</p>
            <p>Whenever the thunder of human Juſtice is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in the receſs of human Sorrow, it is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
rod erected on the edifice of Tyranny that can
divert the blow,—Man knows your guilt, he is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the Oppreſſion with which you goad him,
and he is preparing the Tribunal of Juſtice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
his injuries,—Exert your caution, make uſe
of your Political Arithmetic and ſay if it is better
to multiply human Sorrows, and divide ſocial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections,
or to to reduce the ſum of miſery, and
caſt up the general account of our Liberties and
Rights; conſider well, with War, Famine and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0646000800:8"/>
—come Diſcord, Vengeance and Deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.—with
Peace, Plenty and Principle,—come
Life, Wealth and Security. Reflect ſeriouſly, give
us BREAD, or the appetites of Nature will oblige
us to devour you? ceaſe to Murder us with your
Military, or the Bayonet that ſlew the unfortunate
victims of Hunger and Poverty, may alſo peirce
the Flinty-heart of the wretch, whoſe being is the
abuſé of life, and whoſe Tyranny is a Libel upon
the patience of MAN.</p>
