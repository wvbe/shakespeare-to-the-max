            <head>THE PLUM-CAKES, &amp;c.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>A FARMER who ſome wealth poſſeſt,</l>
               <l>With three fine boys was alſo bleſt;</l>
               <l>The lads were healthy, ſtout, and young,</l>
               <l>And neither wanted ſenſe nor tongue.</l>
               <l>Tom, Will, and Jack, like other boys,</l>
               <l>Lov'd tops and marbles, ſport and toys.</l>
               <l>The father ſcouted that falſe plan,</l>
               <l>That money only makes the man,</l>
               <l>But, to the beſt of his diſcerning,</l>
               <l>Was bent on giving them good learning:</l>
               <l>He was a man of obſervation,</l>
               <l>No ſcholar, yet had penetration;</l>
               <l>So with due care, a ſchool he ſought,</l>
               <l>Where his young ſons might well be taught.</l>
               <l>Quoth he, "I know not which rehearſes</l>
               <l>"Moſt properly his themes or verſes,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1135800600:3"/>
"Yet I can do a father's part,</l>
               <l>"And ſchool the temper, mind, and heart;</l>
               <l>"The natural bent of each I'll know,</l>
               <l>"And trifles beſt that bent may ſhow."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Twas juſt before the cloſing year,</l>
               <l>When Chriſtmas holidays were near,</l>
               <l>The farmer call'd to ſee his boys,</l>
               <l>And aſk'd how each his time employs.</l>
               <l>Quoth Will, "there's father, boys without,</l>
               <l>"He's brought us ſomething good no doubt."</l>
               <l>The father ſees their merry faces,</l>
               <l>With joy beholds them, and embraces.</l>
               <l>"Come boys, of home you'll have your fill,"</l>
               <l>"Yes, Chriſtmas now is near," ſays Will,</l>
               <l>"'Tis juſt twelve days—theſe notches ſee,</l>
               <l>"My notches with the days agree.</l>
               <l>"Well," ſaid the ſire, "again I'll come,</l>
               <l>"And gladly fetch my brave boys home.</l>
               <l>"You two the dappled mare ſhall ride,</l>
               <l>"Jack mount the poney by his ſide;</l>

"Mean time, my lads, I've brought you here,</l>
               <l>"No ſmall proviſion of good cheer."</l>
               <l>Then from his pockets ſtrait he takes,</l>
               <l>A vaſt profuſion of plum-cakes;</l>
               <l>He counts them out, a plenteous ſtore,</l>
               <l>No boy ſhall have or leſs or more;</l>
               <l>Twelve cakes he gives to each dear ſon,</l>
               <l>When each expected only one;</l>
               <l>And then, with many a kind expreſſion,</l>
               <l>He leaves them to their own diſcretion,</l>
               <l>Reſolv'd to mark the uſe each made</l>
               <l>Of what he to their hands convey'd.</l>

               <l>The twelve days paſt he comes once more,</l>
               <l>And brings the horſes to the door;</l>
               <l>The boys with rapture ſee appear,</l>
               <l>The poney and the dappled mare;</l>
               <l>Each moment now an hour they count,</l>
               <l>And ſlaſh their whips and long to mount.</l>
               <l>As with the boys his ride he takes,</l>
               <l>He aſks the hiſtory of the cakes.</l>

               <l>Says Will, "dear father, life is ſhort,</l>
               <l>"So I reſolved to make quick ſport;</l>
               <l>"The cakes were all ſo nice and ſweet,</l>
               <l>"I thought I'd have one jolly treat,</l>
               <l>"Why ſhould I balk, ſaid I, my taſte?</l>
               <l>"I'll make at once a hearty feaſt.</l>
               <l>"So, ſnugly by myſelf I fed,</l>
               <l>"When every boy was gone to-bed;</l>
               <l>"I gorg' them all, both paſte and plum,</l>
               <l>"And did not waſte a ſingle crumb;</l>
               <l>"Indeed they made me, to my ſorrow,</l>
               <l>"As ſick as death upon the morrow;</l>
               <l>"This made me mourn my rich repaſt,</l>
