                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Wealthy Farmer in the Weſt,</l>
               <l>With Life's Enjoyments amply bleſt,</l>
               <l>A Man eſteem'd both far and near,</l>
               <l>Who in his Houſe kept ſpecial Beer;</l>
               <l>Twelve Children eke around his Table,</l>
               <l>All luſty, lively, brisk and able:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He carried wondrous well his Age,</l>
               <l>His Wife was Houſewifely and Sage;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0765500700:3"/>
They throve, and pick'd up Wealth apace,</l>
               <l>And none at Church of them took Place.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Two Maſtiff Dogs he kept, to guard</l>
               <l>His Houſe, his Poultry, and his Yard;</l>
               <l>With Offal from the Meat he kill'd,</l>
               <l>Their hungry Paunches well he fill'd:</l>
               <l>All ſleek they were, and in good Caſe,</l>
               <l>And ſhew'd the Plenty of the Place.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But in the Houſe they durſt not enter,</l>
               <l>My Dame her Crock'ry would not venture;</l>
               <l>For ſhe had Tea-Table, and China,</l>
               <l>And held her Head as high as any:</l>
               <l>Her Houſe was kept too nice and neat</l>
               <l>For Dogs to traipſe with dirty Feet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For many Years theſe Currs were quiet,</l>
               <l>Nor grumbled at their Bounds or Diet,</l>
               <l>Would bark at Beggar or at Stranger,</l>
               <l>And make much Noiſe at little Danger;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0765500700:4"/>
But, to the Comers too and fro,</l>
               <l>No Marks of Surlineſs they'd ſhew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Hound the Farmer had beſide,</l>
               <l>A Hound! His Hearts delight and Pride;</l>
               <l>Peerleſs he was of all his Kind,</l>
               <l>So fleet! he would out-ſtrip the Wind,</l>
               <l>The beſt that ever follow'd Game,</l>
               <l>Frolick he was, and FLY his Name.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Careſt and lov'd by ev'ry Soul,</l>
               <l>He rang'd the Houſe without Controul;</l>
               <l>This made the angry Maſtiffs jealous,</l>
               <l>FLY ſhould be rais'd above his Fellows:</l>
               <l>Keep his Noſe warm and lick the Plates,</l>
               <l>While they ſtood ſhiv'ring at the Gates.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They grudge each Bit that goes beſide 'em,</l>
               <l>And vow Revenge what e'er betide 'em;</l>
               <l>

In ſhort ſo wond'rous fell they grew,</l>
               <l>At Friend and Foe they fiercely flew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Theſe ugly Currs kept ſuch a Rout,</l>
               <l>That no one durſt ſtir in or out;</l>
               <l>To quiet them their Maſter try'd,</l>
               <l>But they his Threats and Him defy'd:</l>
               <l>Their Fury would not be abated,</l>
               <l>They bark'd the more, the more he rated;</l>
               <l>And made ſuch a confounded Din,</l>
               <l>He thought 'twas beſt to let 'em in:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For why, their Noiſe diſturb'd the Head</l>
               <l>Of my good Dame, now ſick a-bed;</l>
               <l>So, rather than her Head ſhould ake,</l>
               <l>He let 'em in for Quiet's ſake.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But leſt their Rage on him ſhould fall,</l>
               <l>He wiſely rais'd his Plowmen all,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0765500700:6"/>
With Prong, and Fork, and Bill in Hand,</l>
               <l>Theſe furious Creatures to withſtand;</l>
               <l>But for this Caution was no need,</l>
               <l>As by the Sequel you may read:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For ſoon as e'er the Door was ope,</l>
               <l>They both into the Kitchen crope,</l>
               <l>Wagging their Tails, all tame and mild,</l>
               <l>As harmleſs Lamb, or ſucking Child.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Theſe Currs who were ſo fierce before,</l>
               <l>Now crouch and wriggle on the Floor;</l>
               <l>Fawn at the very Servants Feet,</l>
               <l>And tremble leſt they ſhould be beat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Next they traverſe the Kitchen round,</l>
               <l>To ſee what Prog is to be found;</l>
               <l>Where, having fed to Hearts deſire,</l>
               <l>They ſtretch'd themſelves before the Fire,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0765500700:7"/>
Content and ſnug they lay till broad day Light,</l>
