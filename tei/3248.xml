                  <l>Good morning to the Day; and, next, my Gold: </l>
                  <l>Open the shrine, that I may see my Saint. </l>
                  <l>Hayle the worlds soule, and mine.  More glad then is </l>
                  <l>The teeming earth, to see the longd-for Sunne </l>
                  <l>Peepe through the hornes of the Cælestiall Ram, </l>
                  <l>Am I, to view thy splendor, darkening his: </l>
                  <l>That lying here, amongst my other hoordes, </l>
                  <l>Shew'st like a flame, by night; or like the Day </l>
                  <l>Strooke out of Chaos, when all darkenes fled </l>
                  <l>Unto the center.  O thou Son of Sol, </l>
                  <l>(But brighter then thy father) let me kisse, </l>
                  <l>With adoration, thee, and euery relique </l>
                  <l>Of sacred treasure, in this blessed roome. </l>
                  <l>Well did wise Poets, by thy glorious name, </l>
                  <l>Title that age, which they would have the best; </l>
                  <l>Thou being the best of things:  and far transcending </l>
                  <l>All stile of ioy, in children, parents, friends, </l>
                  <l>Or any other waking dreame on earth. </l>
                  <l>Thy lookes when they to Venus did ascribe, </l>
                  <l>They should have given her twenty thousand Cupids; </l>
                  <l>Such are thy beauties, and our loves.  Deare Saint, </l>
                  <l>Riches, the dombe God, that giu'st all men tongues; </l>
                  <l>That canst do naught, and yet mak'st men do all things; </l>
                  <l>The price of soules; euen hell, with thee to boote, </l>
                  <l>Is made worth heauen.  Thou art vertue, fame, </l>
                  <l>Honor, and all things else.  Who can get thee </l>
                  <l>He shall be noble, valiant, honest, wise, — </l>

                  <l>Then in the glad possession; since I gaine </l>
                  <l>No cowmon way:  I vse no trade, no venter; </l>
                  <l>I wound no earth with plow-shares; fat no beasts </l>

                  <l>Teare forth the fathers of poore families </l>
                  <l>Out of their beds, and coffin them aliue, </l>
                  <l>In some kinde, clasping prison, where their bones </l>
                  <l>May be forth-comming, when the flesh is rotten: </l>
                  <l>But your sweet nature doth abhorre these courses; </l>
                  <l>You loath, the widdowes, or the orphans teares </l>
                  <l>Should washe your pauements; or their pityous cries </l>
                  <l>Ring in your roofes:  and beate the ayre, for vengeance. </l>

                  <l>And besides, Sir, </l>
                  <l>You are not like a thresher, that doth stand </l>
                  <l>With a huge flaile, watching a heape of corne, </l>
                  <l>And, hungry, dares not taste the smallest graine, </l>
                  <l>But feedes on mallowes, and such bitter herbes; </l>
                  <l>Nor like the merchant, who hath fill'd his vaults </l>
                  <l>With Romagnia, and rich Candian wines, </l>
                  <l>Yet drinks the lees of Lombards vineger: </l>
                  <l>You will not lie in straw, whilst mothes, and wormes </l>
                  <l>Feed on your sumptuous hangings, and soft bedds. </l>
                  <l>You know the vse of riches, and dare give, now, </l>
                  <l>From that bright heape, to me, your poore obseruer, </l>
                  <l>Or to your Dwarfe, or your Hermaphrodite, </l>
                  <l>Your Eunuch, or what other houshold-trifle </l>
                  <l>Your pleasure allowes maint'nance. </l>

                  <l>Hold thee, Mosca, </l>
                  <l>Take of my hand; thou strik'st on truth, in all: </l>
                  <l>And they are enuious, terme thee Parasite. </l>
                  <l>Call forth my Dwarfe, my Eunuch, and my Foole, </l>
                  <l>And let them make me sport.  What should I do, </l>
                  <l>But cocker up my Genius, and liue free </l>
                  <l>To all delights, my fortune calls me too? </l>
                  <l>I have no wife, no parent, childe, allye, </l>
                  <l>To give my substance too; but whome I make, </l>
                  <l>Must be my heyre:  and this makes men obserue me, </l>
                  <l>This drawes new clients, dayly, to my house, </l>
                  <l>Women, and men, of euery sexe, and age, </l>
                  <l>That bring me presents, send me plate, coyne, iewels, </l>
                  <l>With hope, that when I die, (which they expect </l>
                  <l>Each greedy minute) it shall then returne </l>
                  <l>Ten-fold upon them; whilst some, couetous </l>

                  <l>And counter-worke, the one, unto the other, </l>
                  <l>Contend in gifts, as they would seeme, in love: </l>
                  <l>All which I suffer, playing with their hopes, </l>
                  <l>And am content to coyne them into profit, </l>
                  <l>To looke upon their kindnesse, and take more, </l>
                  <l>And looke on that; still, bearing them in hand, </l>
                  <l>Letting the cherry knock against their lips, </l>

                  <l>Where it had the gift to remember all that euer was done. </l>
                  <l>From thence it fled forth, and made quicke transmigration </l>

                  <l>At the seege of old Troy, by the Cuckold of Sparta. </l>
                  <l>Hermotimus was next (I finde it, in my Charta') </l>
                  <l>To whom it did passe, where no sooner it was missing, </l>
                  <l>But with one Pirrhus, of Delos, it learn'd to go a fishing: </l>
                  <l>And thence, did it enter the Sophist of Greece. </l>
                  <l>From Pithagore, she went into a beautifull peece, </l>
                  <l>Hight Aspasia, the Meretrix; and the next tosse of her </l>

                  <p>Most noble Gent:  and my worthy Patrons, it may seeme 
strange, that I, your Scoto Mantuano, who was euer wont to fixe my 
Banke in face of the publike Piazza, neare the shelter of the portico, 
to the Procuratia, should, now (after eight months absence, from this 
illustrous Citty of Venice) humbly retire my selfe, into an obscure 
nooke of the Piazza;

                  <p>Let me tel you:  I am not (as your Lombard Prouerbe sayth) 
cold on my feete, or content to part with my commodities at a cheaper 
rate, then I accustomed; looke not for it.  Nor, that the calumnious 
reports of that impudent detractor, and shame to our profession, 
(Alessandro Buttone, I meane) who gaue out, in publike, I was condemn'd 
a'Sforzato to the Galleys, for poysoning the Cardinall Bemboos — 
Cooke, hath at all attached, much lesse deiected me.  No, no, 
worthie Gent:  (to tell you true) I cannot indure, to see the rable of 
these ground Ciarlitani, that spread their clokes on the pauement, as 
if they meant to do feates of actiuitie, and then come in, lamely, with 
their mouldy tales out of Boccacio, like stale Tabarine, the Fabulist: 
some of them discoursing their trauells, and of their tedious captiuity 
in the Turkes Galleyes, when indeed (were the truth knowne) 
they were the Christians Galleyes, where very temperately, they 
eate bread, and drunke water, as a wholesome pennance (enioyn'd them 
by their Confessors) for base pilferies.

of their mindes with earthy oppilations, want not their fauourers 
among your shriuel'd, sallad-eating Artizans:  who are ouerioy'd, 
that they may have their halfeperth of Physick, though it purge 
them into another world, makes no matter.

what auayles your rich man to have his magazines stuft with Moscadelli,

paine of death) to drinke nothing but water, cocted with Anise-seeds? 
O health! health! the blessing of the rich, the riches of the poore! 
who can buy thee at too deare a rate, since there is no enioying this

miraculous effects of this my oyle, surnamed oglio del Scoto, with the 
count-lesse catalogue of those I have cured of the aforesayd, and many 
more diseases, the Pattents and Priuiledges of all the Princes, 
and Common-wealthes of Christendome, or but the depositions of 
those that appear'd on my part, before the Signiry of the Sanita', 
and most learned Colledge of Physitians; where I was authorized, 
upon notice taken of the admirable vertues of my medicaments, and 
mine own excellency, in matter of rare, and vnknowne secrets, not 
onely to disperse them publiquely in this famous Citty, but in all the 
Territories, that happely ioy vnder the gouernment of the most pious 
and magnificent States of Italy.  But may some other gallant fellow 
say, O, there be diuers, that make profession to have as good, and as experimented 
receipts, as yours:  Indeed, very many have assay'd, like 
Apes, in imitation of that, which is really, and essentially in me, to 
make of this oyle; bestow'd great cost in furnaces, stilles, alembekes, 
continuall fires, and preparation of the ingredients, as indeede 
there goes to it sixe hundred seuerall Simples, beside, some quantity of 
humane fat, for the conglutination, which we buy of the Anatomistes; 
But, when these Practitioners come to the last decoction, blow, blow, 
puff, puff, and all flies in fumo:  ha, ha, ha.  Poore wretches!  I rather 
pitty their folly, and indiscretion, then their losse of time, and money; 
for those may be recouer'd by industry:  but to be a Foole borne is a 
disease incurable.  For my selfe, I alwaies from my youth have 
indeauor'd to get the rarest secrets, and booke them; eyther in exchange, 
or for money; I spared nor cost, nor labour, where anything 
was worthy to be learned.  And Gentlemen, honourable Gentlemen, 
I will vndertake (by vertue of Chymicall Art) out of the honourable 
hat, that couers your head, to extract the foure Elements; that is 
to say, the Fire, Ayre, Water, and Earth, and returne you your felt, 
without burne, or staine.  For, whilst others have beene at the balloo, 
I have beene at my booke:  and am now past the craggy pathes of 
study, and come to the flowrie plaines of honour, and reputation.

lesse, in curtesie, I know you cannot offer me; take it, or leaue it, howsoeuer, 
both it, and I am at your seruice.  I aske you not, as the valew

so the Cardinalls Montalto, Fernese, the great Duke of Tuscany, 
my Gossip, with diuers other Princes have giuen me; but I despise 
money:  only to shew my affection to you, honorable Gentlemen, and your

mine own offices, fram'd my iourney hither, onely to present you with

it will cost you, or sixe hundred pound — expect no lower price, for by 
the banner of my front, I will not bate a bagatine, that I will have, 
onely, a pledge of your loves, to carry something from amongst you, to 
shew, I am not contemn'd by you.  Therefore, now, tosse your handkerchiefes, 
chearefully, chearefully; and be aduertised, that the first 
heroique spirit, that deignes to grace me, with a handkerchiefe, I 
will give it a little remembrance of something, beside, shall please 
it better, then if I had presented it with a double Pistolet.

                  <p>Lady, I kisse your bounty; and, for this timely grace, you have 
done your poore Scoto of Mantua, I will returne you, ouer and aboue 
my oyle, a secret, of that high, and inestimable nature, shall make you 
for euer enamour'd on that minute, wherein your eye first descended 
on so meane, yet not altogether to be despis'd an obiect.  Here is a Poulder, 
conceal'd in this paper, of which, if I should speake to the worth, 
nine thousand volumes were but as one page, that page as a line, 
that line as a word; so short is this Pilgrimage of man (which some 
call Life) to the expressing of it:  would I reflect on the price?  why, the 
whole World were but as an Empire, that Empire as a Prouince, 
that Prouince as a Banke, that Banke as a priuate Purse, to the 
purchase of it.  I will, onely, tell you; it is the Poulder, that made 
Venus a Goddesse (giuen her by Apollo) that kept her perpetually 
yong, clear'd her wrincles, firm'd her gumnmes, fill'd her skinne, 
colour'd her hayre; From her, deriu'd to Helen, and at the sack of 
Troy (vnfortunately) lost:  Till now, in this our age, it was as happily 
recouer'd, by a studious Antiquary, out of some ruines of Asia, who 
sent a moyetie of it, to the Court of France (but much sophistcated) 
wherewith the Ladyes there, now, colour their hayre.  The rest (at this 
present) remaines with me; extracted, to a Quint essence:  so that, 
where euer it but touches, in youth it perpetually preserues, in age restores 
the complexion; seats your teeth, did they dance like Virginall 
iacks, firme as a wall; makes them white, as Iuory, that were 
black, as —
