               <head>Why I begin at the elementarie, and wherein it consisteth.</head>
               <pb n="1"/>
               <p>THere be two causes, which moue me to the penning of this Elementarie, 
whereof the one is mine own promis, the other is the argument it self. The 
argument it self persuades me to the penning thereof, bycause it is so fit 
for the training vp of childern, as nothing can be fitter: and the stream of 
discourse in my former book, which I name Positions, did carie me on to 
promis it, and binds me to perform it. But for the better linkking of this 
book to that, seing this is nothing else, but the performing of one pece, 
which I promised in that, I must needs shortlie run ouer the main branches 
of that, ear I enter into this. The matter of that book consisteth chefelie in 
two generall points, the one proper, the other proceding. I call that 
argument proper, which is the naturall subiect of that same book, &amp; 
being once handled there desires no further speche in any other treatis. I 
call that proceding which being but named there as a thing most necessarie 
to som further end, requireth more handling, then it hath there, to be better 
fitted for so profitable an end. Of the first sort, which is the proper 
inhabitant of that same book, and to be enquired for there, all those 
discourses be, which concern the teacher, <pb n="2"/>
or the learners person, which concern the place to teach or learn in, which 
concern the time, both when to begin, &amp; how long to continew, and such 
other circumstances, which being once entreated of, discharge my pen from 
dealing with them further, tho thei do not discharge the magistrates of my 
countrie, from heding of them better. Bycause theie be verie full of profit, 
tho somwhat hard of performance, thorough those naturall difficulties, 
which professe enimitie to all good things, and would shoulder them out, for 
taking anie place, either at their first planting, when theie ar to be 
receiued, or vpon default, when theie ar to be redressed. Good things grow 
on verie hardlie at their first planting, bycause that profit, which theie 
promis at their entrie, hath not yet bene proued, and therefor wanteth the 
commendation of triall, which is the verie best mean to enforce persuasion: 
and their pretence to be profitable, vpon som probabilitie in sequele, is a 
great inducement in dede, but to those peple, which can forese ear theie 
fele, but of small importance to them, which cannot se till theie fele. Good 
things finde hard footing, when theie ar to be reformed after a corruption in 
vse, bycause of that enormitie which is in possession, and vsurpeth on their 
place, which hauing strengthened it self by all circumstances, that can moue 
retaining, and with all difficulties, that can dissuade alteration, fighteth 
sore for it self, and hard against redresse, thorough the generall assistence 
of a preiudicate opinion in those mens heds, which might further the 
redresse. Which preiudice in opinion being grounded vpon contentment with 
the acquainted euill, &amp; loth to enter danger for a change of som truble, 
so bewitcheth the reason of the parties seduced, as drink doth that fellow, 
which will rather ly in a ditch all night &amp; call for more clothes when he 
feleth more cold, and bid put out the candle, when he seith the moon shine, 
then he will either be persuaded, that he is drunk at all, or else be entreated 
to get vp &amp; go home: Tho yet at the last som of his wise frinds forseing 
the danger of som sicknesse like to follow, if he ly there long, get him home 
perforce. Such a strength is error of being bakt with long ease, which 
brings ignorance aslepe: and with securitie in persuasion, which neuer 
bredes but ill. <pb n="3"/>
Howbeit for that book, and those persuasions, I must praie my good 
cuntrimen, to think vpon them well, euen for their own sakes. It is the 
general good that hath enforced me to that particular wish. Neither do I 
repent my self for the wishing therof, tho the speding be far of: as I am 
also most redie with all pacience to digest all such difficulties, all such 
thwartings, all such tungstings, as that kinde of wish, being frutelesse for 
the time, vseth to bring with it, to chek and choke a writer. for I fear not in 
the end, but that the extremitie of som euill, tho not the excellencie of som 
good will enforce a reformation by them, which haue power and autoritie to 
redresse. At which time my labour shall find frute, tho my self be not 
found: and my wish shall take effect, tho my self be no partaker. The old 
man planteth with the one foot in his graue, whose honest labour, tho it 
yeild himself no frute, sauing the bare hope to profit his posteritie, yet God 
doth so prosper, as the effect followeth, tho he be not to vse it. And the 
natur of euills, not naturallie euill, which will neuer be better, but euill by 
abuse, which right vse will better, is so loth to be amended, and so long ear 
it harken to the voice of redresse, as the first attempt to haue som 
redresse, the partie attempter is more wondred at for the wish, then 
estemed of as wise. <hi>Homer</hi> the great Greke poët deuiseth a 
monster, which he nameth Até, and giueth her for surname the Ladie of 
harm, with whom he ioyns in fellowship thre other staied matrones, which 
he calleth Litæ, and the Ladies of redresse, after harms be receiued. This 
Até, saith he, is so swift of wing, so strong of bodie, so stirring to do 
il, as she flyes far before, &amp; harmeth where she lighteth. But the thre 
good Ladies, being halt &amp; lame, old and crooked, not a step without a 
staf, cannot foot it so fast, as their fellow can fly, wherevpon it falleth 
out, that harms be soon caught, but healed at leisur, when the old creping 
Ladies come to present a plaster, as theie will com at last, tho it be verie 
long first. This hope haue we wishers, tho we waite long for it. And that 
good God who made all these things, which we so mar, as he promiseth a 
renewing, so is he able to perform it, whose pacience in our misses we must 
follow in our mends. Thus much concerning those arguments, which ar 
proper to my book, that I name <pb n="4"/>
Positions. The other kinde of matter, which is begon in that book, tho not 
ended there, is such as laieth open, what things ar to be followed in the 
course of learning, and what I my self do promis to do for the auancement 
thereof. Those things, which concern the course and training vp to learning, 
laie their first groundwork in the young infants. For whom it is there 
considered both how to frame their tender wits for the matter of their 
learning, and how to train their weak bodies for the maintenance of their 
health. For the preseruing of their helth, there be thre speciall things noted 
there, as most necessarie thereunto, small diet, thin apparell, much 
exercise. Of the which thre I recommend two, their apparell, and their diet, 
to the parents care, as most proper to their charge, bycause theie concern 
home most: the third, which is exercise, I handle there at full, both bycause 
it is a seuerall branch from the manner of learning, and therefor requireth a 
seuerall treatise: and also bycause I would haue that book to haue somwhat 
worth the seking, euen for present necessitie, besides those discourses of 
the generall accidents, that belong to learning, which is the verie subiect of 
those Positions. For the matter of their learning, that is there deuided into 
two parts, the one whereof is knowledge, to encrease vnderstanding, the 
other is behauiour to enlarge vertew. As for behauiour the precept and 
teaching thereof is reserued to the matter, whose profession smels of 
iudgement, and giues abilitie to direct: but the chefe performance &amp; 
practising there of is committed vnto parents, as of nearest care &amp; 
most certain autoritie ouer their own children. For the moning childe hath 
verie manie waies to shift from his teacher, vpon verie many small and 
verie light occasions, God he knoweth: but he hath no mean at all to shake of 
his parents, without losse of his liuing. Wherfor as often change doth 
weaken autoritie in masters at will, so necessarie obedience doth 
strengthen autoritie in parents perforce, and thereby chargeth them with 
their childerns maners. And yet euen that tiklish obedience, which masters 
haue, which is roming still, and neuer but remouing dischargeth not them, so 
far furth, as their commandment will reach. As for knowledge, whereby to 
encrease the childes vnderstanding, <pb n="5"/>
that is assigned to the teacher alone, as proper to his office 
without participation of anie parent, tho a wise and a learned parent be the 
verie best part of the verie best teacher. Now both to help parents in their 
vertewous performance, and to assist teachers in their learned direction, 
that both deliuerie in the one maie procede with order, and receit in the 
other, maie profit with delite, I profered my seruice in generall to them all, 
but first of them all to the elementarie teacher and his tall scholer, as 
whose labour doth first call for aid, to whom I promised this Elementarie 
institution, wherein I entend to handle all those things which young children 
are to learn of right, and maie learn at ease, if their parents will be 
carefull, a litle more then ordinarie. The thinges be fiue in number, infinite 
in vse, principles in place, and these in name, <hi>reading, writing, drawing, 
singing,</hi> and <hi>playing</hi>. Why &amp; wherefor these fiue be so 
profitable and so fit for this place, it shall appear hereafter, when their vse 
shall com in question. In the mean while this is most trew, that in the right 
course of best education to learning and knowledge, all these, &amp; onelie 
these be Elementarie principles, and most necessarie to be delt with all. 
Whatsoeuer else besides these is required in that age, either to strengthen 
their bodies, or to quiken their wits, that is rather incident to exercise for 
helth, then to Elementarie for knowledge. Thus I haue shewed both why I 
begin at the Elementarie, and wherein it consisteth.

            <div xml:id="c1.2" type="chapter">
               <head>That this fiue branched Elementarie is warranted by generall autoritie of all the grauest writers, and all the best common weals.</head>
               <p>IN persuading &amp; admitting euen the verie best things, there be two other 
points, besides the pretended goodnesse in the thing, which theie haue still 
in eie, that ar to be persuaded. Whereof the one is, what countenaunce he 
carieth, which is the persuader, and what mean he vseth to work his 
persuasion. For both the thing, which is in question, must take shew of 
some good, ear it will be receiued: and the partie that <pb n="6"/>
persuadeth, must be of good credit, if he think to be beleued: and the mean 
whereby his persuasion must take place, must be stronglie appointed with 
the best kinde of proufs, both for autoritie in persons, and probabilitie in 
things. For who will allow, but where there is a why? or who will hear him, 
which is, he knoweth not who? or what force can that haue to procure it self 
place, which neither wise man praiseth, nor wise reason proueth? That this 
fiue branched Elementarie, which I seke to persuade, is verie profitable and 
good, there be manie priuat presumptions in our common experience, besides 
the generall proufs, which shal follow hereafter. First, bycause the most of 
these principles be in vse with vs alreadie, tho not with all persons, yet 
sure in all places, where the liking of these things, and the abilitie to bear 
charge do concur in parents. Secondly, bycause euen those which haue them 
not, yet do wish theie had them, when theie fall in thinking of them, vpon 
som either pleasant or profitable obiect, which theie finde wrought by them: 
tho vpon so priuat respect either to sparing or to precise, some kinde of 
people either care not forgetting them at first, or for wishing them at last, 
least theie might seme to condemn their own selues, if theie did wish for 
that, which theie wold not once, as contemning that of passion, which theie 
allow of in iudgement. Besides these two, there be a number mo, which our 
dailie experience doth bring furth, whereby the goodnesse of this argument, 
is euidentlie confirmed. And maie it not seme likelie to anie resonable 
censur, that I my self wold not so force them on publiklie, if theie were not 
in dede excedinglie well warranted, with more then mine own autoritie? 
For who am I to persuade the liking of so full an Elementarie, not allowed of 
the most, neither tried of the best? A simple teacher. And yet that 
teaching name is not plane nothing, in a matter of school. A mean 
companion. That is a great somthing, where the persuaders countenance, is 
to carie awaie the thing. Nay a newfangle. That is very odious, where the 
old currant will not lightlie be changed, and the opinion of right hath both 
the countenance of the best, and contentment of the most, wherevpon to 
make staie. To me it maie be replied, you medle in this matter alone, you do 
but <pb n="7"/>
truble your self: you can not turn the course, which is ordinarie &amp; old, 
and therefore verie strong for you to striue against: this thing which you 
commend is not euerie mans ware: it will not be compased: do you let it 
alone: if you will nedes write, turn your pen to other matters, which the 
state will better like of: which this time will soon allow: which you maie 
persuade with credit, if theie be new, and sutable: or confirm with prase, if 
theie be old, and nede the file. If these and such obiections were not 
allwaie ordinarie euen to euerie one, in all attempts of turning, either from 
the ill to good, or from the good to better, I wold answer them with care, 
but now I nede not, bycause to win a resolute good, he that wisheth to haue 
it must think to wrastle for it, both with words and writing, against 
corruption of time, against the alonenesse of attempt, against the preiudice 
of parties, against the difficulties of performance, &amp; whatsoeuer else. 
Neither must he be discouraged with anie ordinarie thwarting, which is a 
thing well known to well trauelled students, and of least account where it 
is best known, how fearfull a thing soeuer it seme to weak fantsies, by 
crossing of corruption to striue against the stream. For both the stream 
will turn, when a stronger tide returns, and if there be no tide, yet an 
vntired trauell will still on against it, vntill he be aboue it. And more 
honorable it were for som one or som few to be hasard their own credit and 
estimation for the time in fauour of such a thing, as theie know to be of 
credit, tho not in account, then by to timorous a conceit, to sore afraid of a 
popular opinion, not alwaie the soundest, tho most of most swinge, to leaue 
excellent arguments either destitute of defence, if theie be pleaded against, 
or defeated of deliuerie, if theie fortun to be cald for. For maie it not fall 
out, that such a thing, as this is, maie be cald for hereafter, tho presentlie 
not cared for thorough som other occasion, which hath the rudder in hand? I 
had therefor rather that it were redie then, to help when it were wisht for, 
then for fear of misliking at the first setting furth, to defraud the 
posteritie of a thing so passing good. And what if the want of conuenient 
books, appropriate to persons, applied to things, apt for each purpos, both 
hath bene, and be the hinderer of such helps, <pb n="8"/>
which would be ventered on, if men had such volums? And in good sooth, I 
know not anie book in this Elementarie kinde so thoroughlie fitted for such a 
purpos, as I hope this shall proue. What there be in other kindes I will then 
shew mine opinion, when I com to their placing. But for this present, 
bycause there maie be such counterbufs, as I haue said before, against my 
countenaunce in this persuasion, notwithstanding the good, which is more 
then half confessed to be in the thing, I haue therefor by waie of mean to 
work persuasion, fenced my hole choice in all these principles, with the 
best autoritie of most allowed writers, who commend the vse of them in one 
hole traine, and with the greatest weight of most apparent reasons, which 
maie persuade vs thoroughlie to entertain them so, as their desert is 
worthie, and as their worthinesse deserues. Which two proufs, I thinke 
maie verie well persuade anie reasonable man, both to beleue me, and to 
embrace them. But will ye hear the writers them selues speak? theie shall 
not nede to be many bycause the testimonie of a few is sufficient enough, 
where the truth of a thing is called in question, and those few in that kinde 
be held for most trew, the kinde it selfe being such as concerneth not 
religion, but onelie common policie, tho the policie be but simple, where the 
religion is but small. Besides this all such writers as saie the same with 
them afte their time, be but quils of that cundit, whereof theie ar the head: 
or if theie were before them, theie are so confirmed by them, as the second 
confirmeres be of more estimation then the verie first founders, both for 
their owne valew, for the credit of their countries, and the euidence of their 
time. For when theie liued, there were so great broods of most learned men, 
as would not haue let them go vncontrolled, if theie had missed the cussion. 
Therefore I must nedes think, that theie did not misse, and so much the 
rather, bycause theie name all the principles, which argeweth aduise: &amp; 
shew, for whom theie fit, which proueth a good forecast. Whereby theie 
direct vs also not onlie in the choice of matter to learn, but also in the 
choice of wits fit to learn. First of all Plato a man in these arguments verie 
well thought of among those that be learned examining of purpos what 
things be nedefull for the first education of young children, findeth out <pb n="9"/>
gymnastik for the bodie and Musik for the minde, where he constreweth 
Musik a great deall larger then we commonlie do, comprising vnder that 
name speche, and harmonie: and therewithall implicatiuelie he 
comprehendeth writing &amp; reading for the benefit of speche, as singing 
and plaing for the vtterance of harmonie. A thing not gathered in him by me 
in natur of anie consequence, but vttered by himself, in the waie of his 
discourse. In the same place freing poetrie from fabulous and vnsemelie 
arguments, and pictur from wanton &amp; lasciuious resemblances, which he 
fineth both he refuseth neither: but as by clensing poetrie he proueth 
grammer to be but an <hi>Elementarie</hi> principle, so by clearing picture, he 
proues drawing to be another. Whereunto he might be the sooner moued, 
bycause <hi>Pamphilus</hi> the Macedonian, master to the famous 
<hi>Apelles</hi> about the same time procured throughout al Grece, that 
drawing should be held for the first degre of liberall science in the training 
vp of children, and that no bondman should be admitted to vse the pencill. 
Wherevpon <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, that he neuer red of, neither yet euer saw 
anie excellent pece of work painted by a bondman, tho manie by wemen. It 
should also seme that <hi>Aristotles</hi> plane speche concerning drawing did 
take hold of that act procured by <hi>Pamphilus</hi>, who examining, as 
<hi>Plato</hi> did, in what things childern were to be trained vp, setteth down 
all the fiue principles by name and allegeth great reasons, why the minde is 
to be fashioned by them for learning, as the bodie is by gymnastik for 
exercise. He spendeth also the most part of the eight of his politiks to clear 
<hi>Musick</hi> from blame, and to proue it nedefull euen for bettering of 
maners besides vndouted pleasur. <hi>Quintilian</hi> also a Rhetorik master 
among the Romanes, and of no lesse account in his cuntrie then he was of 
cunning, and so estemed of among vs, in the framing of his best orator, first 
nameth <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>reading</hi>, and with som earnest chalenge 
taketh vpon him the protection of <hi>Musik</hi>, whose two arms 
<hi>singing</hi> and <hi>plaing</hi> be. And in the same place vsing the same 
fauour to <hi>Arithmetik</hi> and <hi>Geometrie</hi>, which perfit the pen and 
pencill in <hi>Apelles</hi> his opinion, as the pen and pencill be their 
principles in common sense, he could <pb n="10"/>
not but allow the one, admitting the other, as <hi>Plato</hi> did before him not 
refusing where he fined. I will rest content with the assured credit of 
these thre onelie, as principall among all, whether philosophers, or other, 
whereof there is none, but he doth allow of those principles, which these 
thre appoint, and I haue chosen. Neither is there anie other of either valew 
or account, which handleth this argument of childerns foretrain, whether in 
Greke or Latin, whether of purpos or by passage, whether Christian or 
prophane writer, but he ioyneth with them and me herein, tho in som after 
learning, and fear of som misuse, theie somtime dissent, and wish rather 
that the principles were wanting then the perills should take place, which 
unwise peple seme to be subiect vnto, by dealing to far with them, a false 
slander to good principles, tho a iust reproche to ill peple. The best 
appointed common wealls also, in the best &amp; most florishing times for 
all kinde of learning embraced the same train, a thing as easie to be proued, 
by all the best writers, in most plane terms, if I thought it nede full, as it 
is roundlie said in these few words. For it is not my resolution to vse manie 
names, tho I know the men, saue in those cases, where I must haue som 
companie of known note, to satisfie som humors, or else seme my self to be 
of either none, or but of verie small account. Neither is it anie discredit for 
a Christian writer in cases of learning and education, such as these be, 
where Christianism maie furnish the matter, tho prophanism yeild the form, 
to follow the president of prophane common wealls, &amp; to cite the 
testimonie of old philosophers, from whence we set the most part of our 
learning. Neither can anie Christian state, or anie relligious consideration 
tho neuer so precise, but think verie well of these Elementarie principles, 
which the panims do, allow if theie be aduisedlie considered, and not hedilie 
renounced, by either raptnesse in conceit, or rashnesse in iudgement, before 
theie be well weied. For the same principles of learning, &amp; the same 
faculties being learned, did arm the Christians to ouerthrow, which armd 
the infidels to assail, as the learned diuines know to be most trew, by both 
the old greke writers, as <hi>Iustine</hi> the martir <hi>Eusebius</hi> the 
storier, and who not of that race? &amp; by the old latin autors to, as 
<hi>Lactanius</hi> and <hi>Austen</hi>, and who but of that <pb n="11"/>
crew? whose names I wold not spare, if that were best for spede. And why 
not <hi>Agar</hi> beloued in obedience to hir mistresse, as banished for hir 
stomak? seing it pleased <hi>Philo</hi> to make fre <hi>Sara</hi> the type of 
right religion, &amp; bond <hi>Agar</hi> the type of other leaning. For the ills 
which ar pretended to come by them which be the chefe, naie the onelie 
causes why som honest but to credulous naturs do mislike som of them: the 
common wealls which shall admit them &amp; the parties which wil learn 
them for their profit sake, must take hede therevnto, least a more perillous 
harm do chance to crepe in vnder the colour of profit: seing the falts 
wherewith theie ar charged procede not from the things as naturallie euill, 
but from the persons, as naturall abusers, euen of what so is best. Which 
point in waie of their iustification shalbe laid verie plane in the particular 
discourses of euerie principle. Well then, thus do all writers, thus do al 
estates, thus do all relligions esteme of these principles for the number, 
&amp; goodnesse thereof, for where allowance of number is, the allowance 
of their good is granted before hand.

               <head>The opinion of the best writers concerning the choice of wits fit for learning.</head>
               <p>I Said before that the best writers did not onelie agre vpon the number of 
principles, but also did appoint for what kinde of wits it were most 
agreable to be trained vp in them. Of the principles I haue spoken 
sufficientlie: now let vs se, what their opinion is concerning the choice of 
wits. Which choice is a thing to be verie much thought on at all times, 
&amp; in all places, but in these our daies, and this our cuntrie vpon speciall 
causes to be narrowlie looked vnto, as I haue said more then once, &amp; 
that in places mo then one. For the consideration is weightier to whom ye 
commit learning, when ye haue found what to learn, then to find what to 
learn, before ye commit it. Bycause the best instrument wold allwaie be 
handled by the fittest person, &amp; not by euerie one, that hath a fantsie to 
handle it. The want of this choice while priuat liking, &amp; not publik 
order giues learning hir student, doth cause more mischiefe, then the ground <pb n="12"/>
whereof is yet not found, tho the smart thereof be felt. And to saie the 
truth why is it a question, what wits be fittest to be set to learning, if 
there be no choice made, when the question is decided. The old writers 
declare the necessitie of this choice to be exceding great, euen in that theie 
themselues be so curious care full to finde out such wits, as ar to be trained 
that waie. Which their carefullnesse doth seme as it were to saie, what can 
anie thing, be it neuer so good auaill the estate, for the which it should 
serue, if it be not committed vnto such persons, as be fit to execute? Which 
commission taking hir beginning in the young childe, for matters of learning, 
ought not good choice to go before, where such an effect is to follow? In 
ane vniust man doth not the commission of iustice wrong a number of 
people? In a rash captain doth not the charge ouer soldiers bring a number 
to their end? And to Philosophie (which is a generall name to all learning 
among the old writers) can there possiblie be anie greater dishonor saith 
<hi>Plato</hi>, then to be committed to bastard wits, and not of hir own 
kinde? Naie can there be anie greater plage to anie common weall, then to 
haue that mean, which is naturallie hir best and of most profit, if the 
person, which shall vse it, be well appointed, to proue to be her worst, and 
hir greatest hinderer, by either the no choice, or else the verie ill choice of 
that same person? Wherefor in the choice of wits allyed naturallie to 
learning, theie first consider the end, wherefor theie ar to serue, when theie 
ar once learned, &amp; then their qualities, whereby theie ar proued to be fit 
for learning. In the end theie consider, whether he, that is learned to liue 
priuatlie to him self, or publiklie for others. For as those, which serue in 
publik function do turn their learning to publik vse, which is the naturall vse 
of all learning: so such as liue to themselues either for pleasur in their 
studie, or to auoid foren truble do turn their learning to a priuate ease, 
which is the priuat abuse of a publik good. For the common weall is the 
measur of euerie mans being, which if anie one respect not, he is not to liue 
in it. If he be able to serue and do not, his choice condemns him: if 
infirmitie let his choice his infirmitie is his pardon: if he studie tho 
priuatlie to a publik end, his end is his warrant, tho his mean be mistaken. 
Wherein <hi>Tullies</hi> opinion semeth to be sounder then <hi>Platoes</hi> for 
the not <pb n="13"/>
learuing of philosophers to their priuat studie, if theie were fit to serue in 
anie publik roum. But I do take it that <hi>Plato</hi> ment the higher publik 
seruices, such as the chefe magistrates &amp; hed officers be, which places 
he still reserueth to his chefe philosofers, and in the Monarchie he saueth 
euen the verie croun and principaltie for them. Which so great a charge in 
anie estate the philosofers did seke allwaie to auoid, as being either to 
trublesom, or to much subiect to the peples furie, chefelie in a popular 
gouernment, such as that of Athens was, where the most philosofers were. 
In the choice of these wits for this priuat end, bycause theie could not gesse 
aforehand, what their end wold be, theie vsed the same mean for their first 
train, and sitting of their wit, which theie did vse for the best, and the most 
publik end. In those which learn to that end, that theie maie be profitable in 
publik, and proue so in the end, theie chefelie consider the <hi>principall</hi>
and <hi>subaltern</hi> magistrates. I call those magistates <hi>principall</hi>, 
which ar not subiect to account of their gouernment by anie common order, 
tho in conscience and religion both towards God and men theie be euerie one 
subiect, as stewards by commission, whether theie be Emperours, Kings, or 
whatsoeuer prince of absolut soueraintie, not vassall to anie higher. I call 
those <hi>subaltern</hi> which ruling other yet ar subiect to other, as in a 
Monarchie all the mean and inferiour magistrates, and generallie as in anie 
estate those officers be, which be accountant for their doings. These 
magistrates be theie, whom all their precepts tend vnto, as the principall 
springs of most good or euill in anie estate. Bycause theie be the life &amp; 
soul of their lawes for reward and punishment: the onelie president in all 
doings, to the common subiect, whether themselues be in principall roum, or 
but in subaltern. The principall magistrate is a great president as most 
profitable in good, so most perillous in ill: bycause his vertew, is the 
generall allurement, to resemble the like by, as his vice is the generall 
couert, for impunitie to offenders. The <hi>subaltern</hi> magistrates make a 
state verie lothsom by euill execution, as theie make it verie lightsom, by 
the contrarie dealing. Their own obedience towards their superiors is more 
then a lure to reclame the peple, bycause their obsequiousnesse to those 
that ar aboue them enforceth their vnder ones officiouslie <pb n="14"/>
to obay, both the chefe souerain, &amp; also them themselues. And 
therefor in the choice of their chefe, where the chefe is of choice, theie be 
meruellous vigilant, and chuse most what for time, and not for perpetuitie, 
for fear of ill successe in a verie good choice, where assurance of time 
bredes securitie in time, and securitie no good. Likewise in these 
<hi>subaltern</hi> magistrates theie be no lesse carefull, bycause their places 
and functions concern euerie particular sinew, euerie particular vein, euerie 
particular arterie, naie euerie small filet, and finest string or strip in the 
hole bodie of anie comon weall. Here lieth their choice of their learned 
wits, bycause theie take learning to be a leading qualitie, and therefor 
beseming the place, if it be fitted in person. These theie will haue fed and 
cherished with best matter, from the first time that theie be able to take 
anie pains either for bodilie exercise, or for trauell in learning, vntill theie 
be able to serue that publik turn, wherevnto theie ar destinate, &amp; 
wherefor theie were so trained by publik foresight. In these theie consider 
the maintenance of the state, &amp; therefor in their choice their chefe 
regard is, what wit is most fit in euerie kinde of state, bycause the like as 
it loueth the like best, so bycause of that loue it preferreth it most. Thus 
much concerning the end wherefor the choice is made. In the qualities 
which bewraie fitnesse for learning, theie haue regard to both the bodie and 
the minde. In the bodie theie require, that it be able for strength, and health 
to abide exercise the preseruer of them both: that it be of good proportion 
and correspondent to the minde for trauell in studie, &amp; if it maie be, to 
haue it personable withall, bycause personablenesse is an allurement to 
obedience, a gracious deliuerer of anie inward vertew, &amp; somtime was 
estemed a thing most worthie of the principall feat. Was not <hi>Saul</hi>
noted in his election to be king, to haue bene taller and more personable, 
then the rest of the peple? Did not <hi>Thalestris</hi> the <hi>Amason</hi>
Quene half contemn <hi>Alexander</hi> the great: when she saw his person to 
be of not great shew, whose name was so renoumed, as the report therof did 
cause hir com to se him? Doth not <hi>Euripides</hi> saie &amp; 
<hi>Porphyrie</hi> vpon his word, that a bodie of presence is best worthie to 
rule? In the minde theie consider first the means to conceiue well, and to 
kepe fast, and then those <pb n="15"/>
qualities, which be fittest for performance, when the habit is had. In 
conceiuing well, first theie require a sharpnesse of wit to perceiue soon, 
without taint of dulnesse or difficultie by hard learning: bycause wits 
shrink and recoill sooner, at a thing hard to learn thorough their own 
dulnesse, then theie do at anie labor in the greatest exercise. For in 
learning the burden is the mindes alone, in exercise the bodie bears part 
with the minde. Secondlie theie seke for an inuincible &amp; laborious 
courage to go thorough with al paines. For without such a courage &amp; 
that naturallie had, what wit could awaie with so much trauell of bodie, so 
much toill of minde, so much tiring of both in meditation &amp; studie? 
Theie regard also a desire to be asking, and demanding of others, which be 
better learned, and a delite to resemble the best, &amp; therefore to be 
praised: neuer to be idle, but euer well occupied, tho it be in plaie, so it be 
worthie praise. In the retaining of that, which theie haue conceiued theie 
require a fast memorie to kepe well, and a good foresight to continew it 
well, and by the same means, whereby theie first learned, with all those 
exercises which confirm memorie, &amp; make waie to further knowledge. 
In both these qualities, to conceiue soon, &amp; to kepe fast, theie vse to 
consider certain other signes which be ordinarie companions to anie toward 
wit, as to be naturallie well giuen, to be curteous in behauiour, &amp; such 
of that sort, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> bids giue him that boy, which wilbe quikned 
with praise, which wilbe aloft with honor, which will wepe at a foill. This 
boy saith he must be fed with braueries, him cherishing will encourage, in 
him I fear no loytering. In stede of that weping at a foil <hi>Xenophon</hi> in 
the person of <hi>Cyprus</hi>, whom he deuiseth so perfit, as the best boy for 
a patern to bring vp, &amp; the best price for a president to princes, semeth 
rather to like of laughing himself at himself, thereby neither to take 
laughter in the lookers on for anie kinde of mok: neither to lease anie 
courage, but furthwith to amend the thing, wherein he missed. Whereas 
weping might bewraie a pusillanimitie, and a faint of stomak. But 
<hi>Quintilian</hi> no dout ment, as if that weping can of an inward grefe, not 
quenching but kindling the natural courage, to burst out to the better. So 
<hi>Liuie</hi> saith that the hanging of the head, &amp; the looking down of 
the Romane soldiers, when theie returned homeward <pb n="16"/>
after their foill at <hi>Caudium</hi>, where the gallous was their gate, 
tho theie went vnder it like gese, was no argument of corage vanquished 
&amp; oppressed by so shamefull a despite, but of a suppressed choler &amp; 
a boiling grefe, which longed for occasion, wherby to work reuenge, &amp; 
was thoroughlie ashamed, till theie had changed the shame with their 
enemie for honor, &amp; had died their swords in the deceiuers blood, their 
foil comming not thorough their own defalt, but by folie of their leaders. As 
for <hi>Quintilianes</hi> cokking boy stil perching, still aspiring: such a pert 
conceit maie be good for his oratour, bycause he limits him no place, but it 
is hard for a subiect, whose humilitie is his honor. For the aspiring wit, 
which wilbe still a mounting, giues som euident suspition of a restlesse 
head, in anie kinde of state, least fit for a Monarchie, &amp; lesse profitable 
to it self. Bycause desiring stil to be the best, if he misse, he moills other, 
if he hit, he harms himself, by insolence of thought, not content with a 
mediocritie, as to far beneath him, nether able to get much, as not fit for 
his humor, where the state is to distribut, as it thinks of the person, and not 
the person to receiue as he thinks of himself. In the generall learner I like 
that disposition best, which <hi>Terence</hi> doth attribut to young 
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> in his comedie called <hi>Andria</hi>: in whom I obserue two 
seuerall properties, the one for learning, the other for behauior. For his 
learning he was neither to excellent to be enuyed, neither to mean to be 
contemned, but as not aboue all in anie thing, so not beneath all in anie: that 
much allowed mediocritie being the rule of his learning. In behauior 
towards other he had acquainted himself to bear with all companies in most 
varietie of behauior, to yeild himself to them in honestie of delite, 
contrarying none, contemning none, neuer bragging of his birth, neuer 
vanting of his welth. For certainlie in wits this moderate kinde is most 
contrarie to the worst. If anie one be to singular od, he is fit either for 
valew aboue all to be sent vp to heauen, as to good for the earth; or for vice 
beneath all to be wisht somwhere else, as the earth to good for him, as 
<hi>Plato</hi> dalieth with the like speche in the like case. But those mens 
chefe consideration in their chusing of wits is, what affection to learning 
the childe hath by natur. Bycause it is hard to haill against the stream, as it 
is wonderous easie to row <pb n="17"/>
down with it. Finallie theie knit vp all their choice with this no fantsie, tho 
a fable of <hi>Platoes</hi> Protagoras, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> sent <hi>Mercurie</hi>
down into the world, to distribut learning and vertew among those of the 
world. In which his distribution he gaue learning to peple, according as 
theie were inclined by natur: but he gaue them vertew, which he deuided 
into a remorse to do ill, and a desire to do right, according to necessitie, 
which was to haue few men learned, as as theie were inclined, but to haue 
all men vertewous, as theie ought to be inclined. Bycause one learned man, 
as one physician, will help a great number: but it is necessarie for all men 
to be ashamed to do ill, and to be redie to do good. And with all, there saith 
<hi>Iupiter</hi> to <hi>Mercurie</hi> make this proclamation thoroughout the 
hole world, that theie furthwith kil him, as a disease in a state, who so euer 
is not capable of shame to do wrong, and will to do right. Whereby theie do 
mean, that there wold not be to manie brought vp vnto learning, where both 
natur restrains being not fit in most, and our vse doth not nede them, where 
some few will serue all. Which two considerations natur in most, &amp; 
nede in all, be the chefe grounds of this choice for learning. But vertew 
&amp; goodnesse be required in all, as necessarie for all in this our generall 
nede, &amp; corruption of natur, whereby most be euill, whereas all should 
be good. But I haue said much allredie concerning this choice in diuerse 
places of my former book, which I call Positions, and speciallie in that 
title, which handleth the stripping of, of too manie bookmen. In the 
qualities that declare a wit verie likelie to perform well afterward, when 
learning is obtained, theie commonlie consider the honest disposition, and 
the parties zeall towards morall vertew, and ciuill societie euen for 
honesties sake, without hope of anie profit. Then theie mark next the 
forsight of conceit, which must be neither easie to be deceiued, nor soon to 
be remoued from a right opinion, by either passion in themselues, or 
persuasion of others. And generallie whatsoeuer vertew is like to bewraie 
both a good man, and a good subiect, that theie call to councell in making of 
their choice, to haue their learner make shew, both of capabilitie, &amp; 
keping, in matters of learning, and of towardnesse, and constancie, in 
matters of liuing. In all these wits theie still respect libertie <pb n="18"/>
and not bondage, abilitie and not pouertie, to haue learning liberall, 
where learners be no slaues, and the execution vncorrupt, where nede is not 
to festur. Yet theie do not exclude nede in excellent naturall wits, but theie 
prouide for their abilitie, that theie be not subiect to nede. And tho slaues 
be somtimes learned, yet learning is not slauish: neither when the parties 
demeanor doth procure his fredom, is learning manumised, which was neuer 
bond. Which two reasons, for libertie, and nede, the old wisdom, whereof I 
intreat now, must nedes confesse, if ye look but to <hi>Æsop</hi> among 
slaues, &amp; <hi>Plato</hi> among writers: whereof <hi>Æsop</hi> sought still 
for fredom against seruilitie, &amp; <hi>Plato</hi> for natur against mutable 
fortun, measuring not euen princes by their place, but by their propertie, by 
naturall power, and not by casuall euent. The cause why theie think so much 
of abilitie is the respect of the peple, which will obeie best, where theie be 
ouer topt most: as the cause why theie think so much of fredom is, for that 
slaues haue no voice nor part in the state, being held but for catle, tho 
reasonable withall: whereas learning hath best voice in anie estate, and 
therefor requireth the help of such an vtterer, as is part of the state, and 
capable of best state. Thus much for both the number of the Elementarie 
principles, and the choice of wits most fit for learning, according to the 
iudgement of the eldest, and best writers.

               <head>That this Elementarie and the profitablenesse thereof is confirmed by great reason, and most euident proufs.</head>
               <p>AS for the reasons, which confirm the choice of the Elementarie principles, 
I find them to be both manie, and well appointed, &amp; such, as moue me to 
think, both that these fiue, and that not fewer then these fiue, neither anie 
other then these fiue do make a perfit Elementarie, and that a perfit 
Elementarie is a most excellent thing, and so most excellent, as without the 
which, if it be not either anie at all, or not such as this is, there will great 
defects ensew in yeares, which might be preuented in youth. For as the wise 
<hi>Cato</hi> being demanded what was the chefe point, that did belong to 
husbandrie, answered <pb n="19"/>
to fede well, &amp; dubled the point. And the eloquent 
<hi>Demosthenes</hi> being demanded, what was the chefe point that did 
belong to an orator, answered to gestur well, &amp; dubled the point: so my 
self, tho neither a <hi>Cato</hi> for wisdom, nor a <hi>Demosthenes</hi> for 
eloquence, yet am so resolued in this matter, as if I were demanded what I 
thought to be of chefe force in the hole course, and matter of learning, I 
durst boldlie answer a good Elementarie, and duble the point. <hi>Cato</hi>
answered in that argument, wherewith he was acquainted, being a great 
husband, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in that, wherefor he was estemed, being a 
great orator. And why not I in that, which methink I know being a long 
teacher? That <hi>Cato</hi> answered wiselie, what better reason can you 
require, then the effect thereof in the catle themselues, and the catlelike 
creaturs, which being the husbandmans charge, and staruing without stouer, 
defeat the ill feader of his conceiued stok. That <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his 
action was the soull of his orations, and assured the truth of his iudiciall 
answer, who is better witnesse then euen <hi>Æschines</hi> his enemie? 
Who being banished his cuntrie, by the onelie mean of <hi>Demosthenes</hi>
his tung, did confesse in his exile, that he was sorer wounded with the force 
of his action, which gaue life to his words, then with the strength of his 
words, that found work for his action. That this my opinion concerning the 
infinite commoditie of a good and perfect Elementarie, is as trew in the 
train to learning, as either <hi>Catoes</hi> was in husbandrie, or 
<hi>Demosthenes</hi> his in oratorie, there be six speciall and principall 
causes, which by the greatnesse of their own good effects, do vnfalliblie 
conclude, the excellent benefit therof, euen bycause ech of the principles is 
so excellent good. All which concurring, &amp; meting in the generall end of 
the hole Elementarie, must nedes import a meruellous treasur, to be in the 
hole, where euerie particular, which maketh vp that hole, doth proue to be so 
profitable. The six reasons which by their own priuat goodnesse confirm a 
generall profit in the main Elementarie be these. If the Elementarie do 
season the grene vessell with the swetest liquor, and the vntrained minde 
with the holsommest humor, is the goodnesse thereof doutfull, where the 
substance is so precious? If it make the childe most capable of most 
commendable qualities, which without it he <pb n="20"/>
could not aspire vnto, deserueth it not embracing, which makes so plane a 
waie to so excellent a thing? If it resemble natur in the multitude of hir 
abilities, and procede so in teaching, as she doth in towarding, can the 
currant be but good, which followeth such a gide? If in place of hardnesse, 
it plant facilitie, doth it not help students to saill with a forewind, without 
fear of shipwrak, where all roks be remoued, that theie nede not to be 
feared, or so laid in sight, as theie maie easilie be auoided? If where there 
is now verie great misliking of manie good things, by mean of ignorance, 
which cannot conceiue them, it do cause allowance by the mean of 
knowledge, which of iudgement will allow them, is not learning much bound 
to it, for clearing hir from blemish? Naie, if within the Elementarie compas 
it comprehend also the entrie to language, and the grammer trauell, which is 
the keie to all cunning, maie it not then well be said to be perfect in all 
points, which belong to ane Elementarie? seing in course of studie, where 
language doth end, there learning doth begin? and all that goeth before that, 
as in order it is a principle, so in natur it is Elementarie? Now that it is of 
such efficacie, for seasoning with the best, for conceiuing of the most, for 
resemblance of natur, for exile to hardnesse, for maim to misliking, for 
entrie to speche, it shalbe proued verie planelie, and withall so, as no other 
Elementarie can possiblie compare with it. For as I am thoroughlie 
persuaded, that the first Elementarie, being well perfited is the onelie 
furtherer to all kindes of learning: so am I likewise resolued, that this 
Elementarie, not deuised by me, tho reuiued by me, is the perfection of the 
Elementarie, and so consequentlie the chefe promoter of the after learning, 
which the effect will shew in prouf, as the reasons will in prouing. Which I 
therefor set down, as diligentlie as I can, that my good readers perceiuing 
thereby the profit of the thing, maie the sooner procure the effecting 
thereof, by subscribing to that, which theie se so well warranted.

               <head>That this Elementarie seasoneth the young mindes with the verie best, and swetest liquor.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21"/>OF those six reasons, whereby I take the great vse of this Elementarie to be 
vnfalliblie confirmed, the first is, bycause it doth season the tender, &amp; 
untrained minde with the best &amp; swetest liquor. Which that it doth, 
who will deny, when he shal euidentlie se, nothing to be propounded therein, 
but that, which is most pure &amp; picked? <hi>Plato Aristotle &amp; 
Quintilian</hi> tho not theie alone, in those places of their fortrain, where 
theie wish a childe, that is to be brought vp well, neither to hear, nor to 
read, nor to se anie thing at all in his teaching kinde, &amp; of set purpos, 
but onelie that which is most agreable in opinion with truth, in behauiour 
with vertew: by that their so saing declare vnto vs the qualitie of those 
things, which ar best for childern to deall withall at first. And our own 
relligion, which best knoweth of what importance it is, to haue youth 
embrewed with the best at the first, is meruellous carefull, both to win 
them to it by precept, and to work it in them by practis. For the necessitie 
of beginning at the best, in euerie argument, which hath a beginning, and is 
to procede by order, I shall not nede to saie much either for the good which 
it bringeth, or for the ill which it blemisheth. One <hi>Theodorus</hi> a plaier 
of Tragedies, belike such a one, as <hi>Roscius</hi> was at Rome both 
excellent men in that kinde of action, wold neuer let anie mean or vnskilfull 
actor enter the stage before him, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth, bycause he 
himself wold work the first delite, euen with the verie best, for that he 
knew the force of the first impression, which being laid with pleasur in the 
beholders minde wold cause them procede on with continewance in like 
pleasur, wheras so vnswetenesse at the first might cause harshnes 
thoroughout. Wherein I note also (tho the first planting of best sciences be 
our gardning here) that by his so doing, he either enforced his fellow-plaiers 
to be like to him, &amp; so partakers of the praise: or else he alone bare 
awaie all the praise, as deseruing it alone. Could one <hi>Theodorus</hi> a 
Tragedie plaier espy that in the stage, which was somtime allowed as 
tolerable, outlawed somtime, as vnlawfull, &amp; maie not a scholer spy the 
like in the course of learning, which is still vpon the stage, as most 
profitable still? When the childe shall haue the matter of his 
<hi>Reading</hi>, which is his first principle so well proined and so pikked, as

trewlie, frame him in opinion rightlie, fashion him in behauiour 
ciuillie, and withall contain in som few leaues the greatest varieties of 
most syllabs, the chefe difference of most words, the sundrie pronouncing 
of all parts, and branches of euerie period, doth not <hi>Reading</hi> then 
which is the first principle seme to season verie sure? enriching the minde 
with so precious matter, and furnishing the tung with so perfit and 
vtterance? When the argument of the childs <hi>Copie</hi>, and the direction 
of his hand, whereby he learns to write shalbe answerable to his reading, 
for chocie of good matter, and reuerence to young yeares, neither shall offer 
anie thing to the eie, but that maie beawtifie the minde, and will deserue 
memorie, will not <hi>writing</hi> season well, which so vseth the hand, as it 
helpeth to all good? When the <hi>pen</hi> and <hi>pencill</hi> shalbe restrained 
to those draughts, which serue for present semelinesse, and more cunning to 
com on, for the verie necessarie vses of all our hole life, doth not that same 
liquor, wherewith theie draw so, deserue verie good liking, which will not 
draw at all but where vertew bids draw? When <hi>Musik</hi> shall teach 
nothing, but honest for delite, and pleasant for note, comlie for the place, 
and semelie for the person, sutable to the thing, and seruiceable to 
circumstance, can that humor corrupt, which bredeth such delite, being so 
eueriewhere armd against iust chalenge, of either blame or misliking? For 
the principle of <hi>Grammer</hi>, I will not tuch it here, bycause I entend not 
to deall with it here, but wheresoeuer I shall tuch it, I will tuch it so, as it 
shall answer to the rest in all kinds of good. In the mean time till the 
grammer principle do com to light, that <hi>Reading</hi> shalbe so relligious, 
<hi>Writing</hi> so warie, <hi>Drawing</hi> so dangerlesse, <hi>Singing</hi> so 
semelie, <hi>plaing</hi> so praiseworthie, the euent shall giue euidence, and 
the relice it self shall set furth the seasoning. But by the waie, as the 
Elementarie professeth it self in the course of learning, and in trade of 
school to be the first &amp; best seasoner of the vntrained minde: so ought 
parent, also for their own part both before &amp; during all the Elementarie 
time, to prouide so at home, as there be no ill liquor inconsideratlie powred 
into the grene cask, which maie so corrupt it, as it will either quite refuse 
the good Elementarie humor, or vnwillinglie receiue it, and not to such a 
good, as it <pb n="23"/>
vseth for to work, where the cask is not corrupt. For if the young eies be 
acquainted at home with vnsemelie sights: if the tender ears be more then 
half trained to vncomlie hearings, if the pliable minde be vnwiselie writhen 
to a disfigured shape, if the hole conceit be vnaduisedlie stained with a 
contrarie dy, how can that countenance be liked on in school, whose 
contrarie fauor is most honored at home? Those parents therefor which wil 
look for the best liquor in schools, must not in anie case vse corrupt humor 
at home. For that is most trew, which is vttered by manie, but most 
oraclelike by <hi>Plato</hi>, concerning the strength of that iuyce, which the 
young wits ar first seasoned withall. I will set down <hi>Platoes</hi> words 
first in Greke, where theie be most pithie, and then in English, where theie 
shalbe as plane. <note>Greek passage</note> Which is to saie in English, 
that the beginning of euerie thing is of most moment, chefelie to him, that 
is young and tender, bycause the stamp is then best fashioned, and entreth 
deapest, wherewith ye mean to mark him, and the sequele will be such, as 
the foretrain shall lead, whether soeuer you march, bycause naturalie the 
like still draweth on the like. These words, as theie ar wiselie vttered by 
the graue philosopher, so ought theie to engraf both in parents and masters a 
depe impression to obserue them as carefullie, as theie be spoken trewlie. 
This concordance betwene the parent at home, and the teacher in school for 
the vertewous training vp of their litle young ones, is in verie dede, to bring 
them vnto <hi>Christ</hi>, as we be bid in scriptur. For what else is it, I praie 
you, for a childe to com to <hi>Christ</hi>? or of what other force is it to be a 
Christian childe? Sure not to be baptised onelie in the name of 
<hi>Christ</hi>, but both for truth in religion, and matters of knowledge, both 
for vertew in demeanor, and matters of liuing, to be brought vp so, as he 
maie trewlie resemble him, whose name he beareth, &amp; faithfullie serue 
him, whose conusance he carieth. Hereby it semeth to me to be verie plane, 
that a good elementarie thus appointed, as it seasoneth first, and continueth 
longest, so it doth both best.

            <div xml:id="c1.6" type="chapter">
               <head>That this Elementarie maketh the childe most capable of most commendable qualities.</head>
               <p>THose means make one capable of som further qualitie, by whose helpe that 
partie, which is to com by such a qualitie, both conceiueth it quiker, 
retaineth it faster, and executeth it better. Now those means be in vs either 
naturallie ingenerate, or artificiallie emplanted, and that so, as theie shew 
themselues, both in our bodies, and mindes. Concerning the naturall helps, 
which by the verie inclination bewraie a minde made naturallie fit, either to 
conceiue, or to retain, or to execute anie learned qualitie well and therefor 
the better, bycause the more naturallie, I haue spoken enough in the question 
of choice, where I wish by the autoritie of the best writers, that such wits 
onelie were set to learning, as naturallie bear som fauor that waie. 
Concerning such naturall properties, as will discry a bodie fit for anie 
exercise, either to kepe the bodie it self in helth in one, that is not student: 
or to assist the minde in all hir executions, in one that is a student, I haue 
said enough in my book of Positions, where I handle exercise. Neither is the 
question at this time of anie naturall inclination, but of artificiall helps, 
and those not for the bodie, which point is for Gymnastik and exercise of the 
bodie, but onelie for the minde, tho wrought by the bodie, which is for these 
principles, and the Elementarie learning: I saie therefor that these fiue 
principles, <hi>reading, writing, drawing, singing,</hi> and <hi>playing</hi>, 
which make this hole Elementarie, besides exercise, which is Elementarie 
to, tho handled elswhere, be the onelie artificiall means to make a minde 
capable of all the best qualities, which ar to be engraffed in the minde, tho 
to be executed by the bodie: which best qualities be two, vertew for 
behauior, and knowledge for cunning. Vnder the name of behauior I comprise 
all those qualities, whose honor is in action, as vnder the name of 
knowledge I imply all those, whose soueraintie is in skill, tho either of 
them both both <note>sic</note> know ear theie do, &amp; do as theie know. 
For vertew and the planting thereof, it hath no cause to complain of this 
Elementarie, which giueth precepts vnto children how to learn <pb n="25"/>
to do well, and so preserueth vertew, as much as direction can. What 
furtherance else is to be had therevnto by practising that in dede, which is 
commanded in word, that is reserued also, &amp; most earnestlie 
recommended euen by this Elementarie to all parents and teachers, 
according vnto the distinction of that autoritie, which theie haue ouer 
childern. Doth not this Elementarie then make childern most capable of 
vertew in elder years, for whose growing it is so carefull in their tender 
age, both by precept and performance? As for <hi>knowledge</hi> which 
tendeth directlie vnto cunning these fiue principles serue directlie 
therevnto. For by them the minde is prepared and made fit to receiue and 
vnderstand all things, which either natur doth bequeath vs, or labor prouides 
for vs: By <hi>reading</hi> we receiue what antiquitie hath left vs, by writing 
we deliuer what posteritie causes of vs: By resembling with pencill what 
aspectable thing is there, and subiect to the eie, either brought furth by 
natur, or set furth by art, whose knowledge and vse we attain not vnto? By 
the principle of musik besides the purchace of a noble science, so certainlie 
platted by Arithmeticall precept, as no one better, so necessarie a step to 
further knowledge, as no one more, such a glasse wherein to behold both the 
beawtie of concord, an the blots of dissension euen in a politik bodie, as no 
one surer: how manie helps and how great ease receiueth our naturall 
infirmitie either in care for comfort, or in hope for courage. Not here to 
tuch the skilfull handling of the rude voice, nor the fine nimbling of the raw 
finger, things not to be refused where theie maie be well had, and naturallie 
required, where imperfection is to be perfited by them. Againe doth not all 
our learning conceiued by the eie, and vttered by the tung confesse the great 
benefit which it receiueth by <hi>reading</hi>? Doth not all our deliuerie 
brought furth by the minde, and set furth by the pen acknowledge a dewtie to 
the principle of <hi>writing</hi>? Doth not all our descriptions, which figur in 
the thought, and pictur to the sense both preach &amp; praise the pencill, 
which causeth them to be sene? Doth not all our delite in times not bisied 
(as all our labour is for rest, all our trauell for ease, all our care to auoide 
care) protest in plane termes, that it is wonderfullie <pb n="26"/>
endetted to either part of Musik, both by instrument and voice? the 
naturall sweter of our sour life in anie mans iudgement, that is not to sour? 
Now what learned qualitie is there of anie commendation, but it falleth 
within this number, and is furthered by these principles, whether it be chefe 
profession of greater note, or meaner facultie of lesse account, or 
necessarie trade of vnforbearable vse? And not to leaue exercise quite 
vntuched, seing it is mere Elementarie, &amp; alwaie to ioyn with ech 
ascent in learning, as the bodie growing in strength or in years requireth 
more or lesse stirring: by the artificiall benefit thereof the fete excell in 
swiftnesse, if natur be according, the arms in strength, the hole bodie in ech 
part, for all gifts in ech part, which either concern helth or cause actiuitie. 
And as so manie principles appointed for the minde being cunninglie applied 
thereunto, do make it most able both to conceiue with the soonest, and to 
deliuer with the fairest: euen so the one principle of exercise being 
skilfullie applied according to right circunstance maketh the bodie most 
actiue in all parts, to execute all functions both of necessitie and praise 
with a meruellous nimblenesse. All qualities therefor whether belonging to 
the bodie, bycause their execution is by it, or partaining to the minde, 
bycause their seat is in it, must nedes confesse themselues to be so auanced 
by this Elementarie, as in dede theie were nothing, if it were not. Take 
exercise awaie, what then is the bodie, but an vnweildie lump? what vse of 
it hath either cuntrie in defence, or it self in delite? Remoue precept and 
practis, and where then is vertew, which neither knoweth, what to do, if it 
be not directed, neither doth when it knoweth, if it faill of practis? Set 
these fiue principles apart, what can the vnlearned eie iudge of? the 
vntrained hand deall with? the vnframed voice please with? If all the 
principles want, then all the qualities faill, if som certain want, then so 
manie faill, as procede from them that want. If all the principles be had, 
then all the qualities will follow. Wherefor I conclude, that if all 
commendable qualities do fall within this compas, if these principles 
auance them all, if want in the one cause defect in the other, that then this 
Elementarie must nedes cause the childe being so well trained, to be most 
capable of most commendable qualities, and that the defect in these <pb n="27"/>
must of mere necessitie cause defect in those. Whereof theie can best 
iudge, which when theie grow in years, then perceiue their own lak, which 
commeth for want of such a foretraine. At which time one of these things 
streight waie enseweth. Either theie condemn that, which theie know not, 
thorough ignorance: or theie contemn that, which theie dispare of, thorough 
insolence: or theie mone that, which theie misse of, thorough negligence, 
most comonlie of frinds, which regarding litle else, but the wait to welth, 
desire rather a compendious path to compas that, then a longer circuit to 
com by a better, tho in the end theie perceiue, that at the first theie might 
well haue obtained both, with verie small ado. Wherefor the Elementarie 
being so absolut, and yeilding so great a capableness to further qualities, it 
were to great an ouersight in those parents, which haue oportunitie at will, 
to neglect it in their childern, &amp; in stede of knowledge in all, to leaue 
them ignorant in som, and cause them in years to mislike, where theie 
cannot iudge, contemn where theie cannot compas, bewaill where theie fele 
want, chefelie considering, that as it will make childern capable of the 
most, so it self is compassable, well nigh by the meanest.

            </div>
            <div xml:id="c1.7" type="chapter">
               <head>That this Elementarie resembleth natur, both in number of abilities and in maner of proceding.</head>
               <p>THe third prouf of a good Elementarie was to resemble natur in multitude of 
abilities, and to procede so in teaching, as she doth in towarding. For as she 
is vnfrindlie, wheresoeuer she is forced, so is she the best gide, that anie 
man can follow, wheresoeuer she fauoreth. Wherefor if natur make a childe 
most fit to excell in manie singularities, so theie be furthered and auanced 
by Elementarie train in the younger yeares, is not that education much to be 
blamed, by whom the salt coms, and the infant is defeated of that same 
excellencie, which natur voweth, and negligence voideth? 


</p>
               <p>Again, when there is nothing ment vs by natur, but train will help it 
forward, is not train it self to be thought most perfit, and the mean of the 
train to be held most absolut, which spredes <pb n="28"/>
with natur, where she splaieth most, as manifold in prefering, as she is 
in profering. 


</p>
               <p>When I vse the name of natur, I mean that power, which God hath emplanted 
in these his creaturs both to continew their own kinde, that it do not decaie, 
&amp; to answer that end, wherefor theie were made. The continewance of 
their kinde is the prouf of their being, but the answering of their end, is the 
frute of their being. This latter part is that point, wherevnto education hath 
a speciall eie (tho it contemn not the other) that the young fry maie be 
brought vp so, as theie maie proue good in the end, and serue well in that 
place, wherevnto theie shalbe loted, for the benefit of the countrie, when 
theie com to years, and full state of prouf. For the performance whereof 
that theie maie proue such in dede, I take it, that this Elementarie in his 
kinde is most sufficient, as being the best mean to perfit all those abilities, 
which natur endoweth our kinde withall, by those same principles, which art 
and consideration appointeth it withall: and by vsing such pollicie in the 
waie &amp; passage to artificiall perfection, as natur hir self doth vie in hir 
ascending to hir naturall height. Bycause the end of education, and train is 
to help natur vnto hir perfection, which is, when all hir abilities be perfited 
in their habit, wherevnto right Elements be right great helps. 


</p>
               <p>This is that resemblance of natur, which I do mean, not to counterfeat hir in 
som other work, as fondlie comparing, or frowardlie bragging with the 
effects of natur, like som <hi>Apelles</hi> in purtrait, or som 
<hi>Archimedes</hi> in motion, but when consideration &amp; iudgement 
wiselie marking, whereunto natur is either euidentlie giuen, or secretlie 
affectionat, doth frame an education consonant therevnto, to bring all those 
things to perfection by art, which natur wisheth perfit, by franknesse of hir 
offer. If natur do offer a towardnesse to write, and no impediment let, but 
it maie be well applied, is not consideration vntoward, if that abilitie want 
forwarding? If with som small help a childes voice maie be made swete, 
tunable and cunning, is not education lame, if it continew harsh, vnpleasant, 
and rude? If by benefit of natur, we be made fit for mo qualities, then 
ordinarie education doth help vs vnto, do we not blame them, who hauing 
gouernment ouer vs, leaue vs ignorant in that, which in ripenesse <pb n="29"/>
of years we want in our selues, and wonder at in others? whose 
traine being better then ours, tho perhaps neither wit quikker, not bodie 
nimbler, doth serue for a prouf, that curteous natur is oftimes verie frank, 
where vnkinde fortun sheweth verie small frindship: naie that either 
negligence or folie inconsideratlie cutteth of, that naturall abilitie, most 
liberallie bestowed. Whereupon I ground my argument that this must nedes 
be a verie good Elementarie, bycause it preferreth all things which natur 
offereth to a commendable end, and sheweth it self as considerat a teacher, 
as natur doth hir self an excellent towarder. 


</p>
               <p>But for the better vnderstanding of my conclusion, and this great 
concordance, which I note to be betwene natur in framing, and art in 
training, both for number of abilities, and for maner of proceding, I will 
first examin the naturall abilities, which ar to be perfited, &amp; how natur 
hirself doth forward the perfection: then I will shew, how those principles, 
which art hath deuised for the furtherance of natur, do answer vnto those 
abilities of natur, both for sufficiencie in number, and fitnesse to 
perfection. For where there be verie manie effects, which ar to be wrought, 
there must nedes be manie means, to being the effect about. Where natur hir 
self offereth verie good hold, there art must be at hand and redie to take it: 
where natur is frutefull, and plaieth the good mother, there art must be 
carefull and proue a good nurse. For it is most trew, that most excellent 
gifts, and endowments of natur, be verie oftimes spoiled by the onelie mean 
of negligent nurtur. 


</p>
               <p>I call those naturall abilities, which natur planteth in our mindes and 
bodies, prepared by hir self for vs to vse, but to be perfited by our selues, to 
our own best vse, whereunto that power of our minde, or that part of our 
bodie doth speciallie serue, in which that abilitie is naturallie placed: As 
for example, natur planteth in the hand an abilitie to catch and hold, which 
that it maie do to the best effect, and to that vse for the which we haue our 
hand, our own pollicie and practis must be our best mean. Natur planteth in 
our minde an abilitie to forese such things, as be to com, which that it maie 
do to our greatest profit, our own wisdom, &amp; our own consideration, 
must be our <pb n="30"/>
best mean. Whereby it will fall out, that we our own selues do cause our 
own want, if we do not our endeuor, to further those helps, which the 
goodnesse of natur, naie, which the goodnesse of God, the Lord and prince of 
natur, of his own mere gift doth so bestow vpon vs, as we maie frelie haue 
them, if we list to apply them. If the case were such, as we our selues were 
willing to vse them, if we had them, and had them not, the complaint might 
tuch natur, for not answering our will, but now that we haue them, if we do 
not vse them, the blame will tuch our selues, for not answering hir 
goodnesse. 


</p>
               <p>I call those Artificiall principles, which mans wisdom hauing considered the 
entendment of natur doth deuise for himself, so manie in number, and so fit 
in qualitie, as theie maie take sure hold of all naturall inclinations and 
abilities, &amp; bring them to perfection by the like mean, and the like 
ascent, in training them to that end, which pollicie doth shout at, as natur 
sheweth hir self to be verie well willing to follow the hand of anie such a 
trainer, by such a mean as is deuised, to such an end, as she desireth: As in 
the former examples of the hand to hold sure, &amp; the minde to forese, 
which be naturall abilities, artificiall principle is to vse such exercises, 
and so considerate experiments, and with such precisenesse in the vse of 
them both, as the hand maie hold best, and surest with all, the minde forese 
most, and furthest withall. Where natur grounded onelie bare holding, and 
simple foresight, direction entended the best in them both, as natur did not 
seme to be verie froward in either, whose perfection lyes in both. 


</p>
               <p>By these descriptions it appeareth, that of these naturall qualities som 
concern the bodie and som the soull, and that both theie help either to our 
mere being onelie, or to our well being withall: and also that the mean both 
to work our being in the one kinde best, and our welbeing in the other kinde 
as well, must be so applied, as natur hir self shall seme to be most pliant, 
which pliablenesse of natur will shew it self, both by case in the working, 
and by vse in the work. 


</p>
               <p>But forsumuch as the handling of all these qualities, first of the bodie, and 
then of the minde, next of our being, and then of our well being, whether 
imperfit in nature, or perfit in <pb n="31"/>
train, wilbe somwhat tedious to deal withall seuerallie, and the things 
themselues maie be wel enough vnderstood being handled together, seing in 
all our executions both the bodie &amp; minde do alwaie concur, tho either 
more or lesse, as the thing that is don, procedeth in proportion from either 
of their parts: I will therefor handle them ioyntlie in one treatis, as theie 
themselues do ioyn allwaie in one practis, &amp; that chefelie in respect of 
our being, first mere, and then well. Whereof the first, which concern our 
mere being, be altogether naturall, tho principles to the last, by mean of 
education : the latter which conern our well being, be mere artificiall but 
bilding vpon natur by waie of fundation, and proue so much the finer, where 
theie haue hir fauor, as either nothing at all, or but of small account, where 
she semeth to froun. 


</p>
               <p>Those abilities therefore belong to mens being, without the which theie 
could not once so much as liue, or bear the name of men in the naturall sense 
of their first humanitie: Those belong to their well being, without the 
which tho theie maie liue and continew men, yet ar theie extreme rude, and 
in dede no bodie, in the principall sense of their best humanitie. Without the 
abilitie to receiue sustenance, &amp; to haue it tendered, when natur doth 
command it, a man cannot liue. Wherefor that abilitie &amp; such other like, 
concern his mere being, tho by his so being he be but half a beast, which 
fedes, as wel as he doth, tho not with like change. Whithout the abilitie to 
conceiue and vnderstand, what is most semelie in everie circumsance, and 
to haue it fined, to the most ciuill vse, a man maie liue tho exceding rude, 
and therefor that abilitie, and such other like ocncern his well being, 
whereby he is likest him, of whom he hath his being, and most sociable with 
them among whom his being is. 


</p>
               <p>Now as I finde in natur both by the effects, which these abilities work, and 
by the places, wherein theie ar bestowed, that she means us verie much, and 
verie manifold good: so for the auancing of euerie of them to the same 
effects, which natur entendeth, I find also in this Elementarie, that it hath 
seuerall branches, wherewith to supply their seuerall turns, as it shalbe 
proued first in the abilities of our mere being, and then in those, which 
concern our best being. Whereby it shall also appear, <pb n="32"/>
that neither natur, nor we haue anie cause to complain: Natur, that she is 
but sklenderlie furthered, where she meaneth great matters: we, as missing 
of that by insufficiencie of train, which natur ment vs by varietie of gifts. 
And that therefor this Elementarie being so well appointed by so wise men, 
as the first deuisers thereof were, deserueth the embracing, which so 
answereth naturs liberalitie in endoument, by sufficient varietie in 
artificiall principle. 


</p>
               <p>For the being of man, to maintain and encrease his bodie in euerie part and 
parcell thereof, and so afterward to sprede the like to it self, in euerie 
kinde thoroughout, natur hath planted in our bodies, which is hir first 
subiect, a <hi>liuer</hi>, the first and formost part of hir frame, and our main, 
which <hi>liuer</hi> receiuing an eager humor from the <hi>milt</hi>, wherewith 
our appetite to meat is stirred, fetcheth the same meat down from the 
mouth thorough the throte into the stomak, wherein it retaineth it, vntill 
thorough heat and humor, it be well digested, and perfitlie distributed by 
the veins thoroughout the hole bodie, the superfluitie thereof being expelled, 
and the purest being reserued, to fede the bodie for fainting, to enlarge it 
for encrease: to make matter for succession and continuance of the kinde. 


</p>
               <p>Again besides the preseruing of our bodies by that norishing mean we haue 
also a perceiuing by outward sense to fele, to hear, to se, to smell, to tast 
all sensible things, which qualities of the outward, being receiued in by the 
<hi>common sense</hi>, and examined by <hi>fantsie</hi>, ar deliuered to 
<hi>remembrance</hi> and afterward proue our great and onelie grounds vnto 
further knowledge. Moreouer we haue also a certaine force to moue and stir 
either by commandment of passion, or by enticement of desire, either by the 
waie of prosecuting for the vse of life, by pulse and breathing, or by waie of 
proceding to do somwhat else, by going, running, leaping and suchlike 
actions. To serue the turn of these two both <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>motion</hi>, 
natur hath planted in our bodie a <hi>brain</hi> the prince of all our parts, 
which by spreding sinews of all sorts, thoroughout all our parts, doth work 
all those effects, which either <hi>sense</hi> is sene in, or <hi>mouing</hi>
perceiued by. 


</p>
               <p>Furthermore our soull hath in it a desire to obtain that, which <pb n="33"/>
it holdeth for good, &amp; to avoid that, which it estemeth for euill: which 
desire worketh, either by quiet alluring, or by insolent inflaming, and when 
the first motion thereof is once set on foot, either by calm persuasion, or by 
vehement heat, it hath a further stirring to attain vnto that in effect, which 
it conceiueth in desire. To satisfy this vse, natur hath placed in our bodie, 
as a liuer to tikle desire, so an hart to kindle heat: and as the sense is 
moued by the qualitie of his obiect, &amp; that motion serued by mean of 
sinewes: so appetite being stirred by his good or ill obiect, hath both his 
prosecuting &amp; refusing supplied by sinewes. 


</p>
               <p>Last of all our soull hath in it an imperiall prerogatiue of vnderstanding 
beyond sense, of iudging by reason, or directing by both, for deutie towards 
God for societie towards men, for conquest in affection, for purchace in 
knowledge, and such other things, whereby it furnisheth out all maner of 
vses in this our mortall life, and bewraieth in it self a more excellent being, 
then to continew still in this roming pilgrimage. To serue this so honorable 
a turn of vnderstanding, and reason, natur tho she haue no place worthie 
enough within this our base and simple bodie, wherein to bestow so great 
&amp; so statelie gests with their hole retinew, yet she doth what she can, 
&amp; being herbinger hirself assigneth them for lodging hir principall 
chamber, the verie closet of the brain, wherein she bestoweth euerie one of 
reasons vnderstanding friends, seruerallie ech one according vnto their 
seuerall degrees, and singular dignities. All those abilities in their first 
naturall kinde concern but the being of a rude man, but when theie ar 
fashioned to their best by good education, theie procure the being of a perfit 
and an excellent man. For, to liue, to fede, to multiplie, to haue sense, to 
desire, to haue the vse of naturall and vnrefined reason. What great thing is 
it, tho it be somwhat more then brute beasts haue, if the other diuine 
qualities, which bild vpon these be not diligentlie followed? Which as theie 
rise out of these at the first, so theie honor them in the end, as much as the 
best frute can honor his first blossom, or as the cunningest work can grace 
that first ground, whereupon it is wrought. 


</p>
               <p>Besides that, theie shew themselues to be those most excellent ends, which 
natur ment first, tho she hirself made but a <pb n="34"/>
weak shew, and yet verie pliable for mans industrie to work on for his own 
commoditie. He that liueth not at all, cannot liue well, he that fedeth not at 
all, cannot fede moderatelie, he that multiplieth not, cannot multiply 
continentlie: he that hath no sense, cannot vse it soberlie: he that desireth 
not, cannot desire consideratlie: he that vseth no reason, cannot vse it 
aduisedlie. But he that liueth, fedeth, multiplieth, hath sense, hath desire, 
hath reason, he hath withall, all those abilities, which natur can afford him, 
to vse them all well, food with moderation, encrease with continence, sense 
with sobernesse, desire with consideration, reason with aduise, and so will 
he vse them, if iudgement maie rule the last, to haue them well, as 
necessitie will the first, simplie to haue them. For as the first abilities 
work their naturall feats by commandment of necessitie, so the latter 
abilities work their laudable feats by direction of reason, which reason as 
it is our difference in comparison with beasts, tho we vse it but meanlie, so 
is it our excellence in comparison with men, if we vse it to the best. 


</p>
               <p>The abilities therefor of that reasonable and vnderstanding part in man 
being handled workmanlike, and applyed to their best by such deuises and 
means, as ar thought fittest to work such an effect, do order and direct the 
diet for foot, &amp; the delite for encrease, to the health of those parts 
which ar appointed for them, and the help of the hole bodie, which is 
compound of those parts. Theie fine the sense, and the instruments thereof 
to their best perfection, &amp; their longest endurance. Theie restrain 
desire to the rule of reason, and the aduise of foresight. Theie so enrich the 
minde and the soull it self, as theie laie vp in the treasurie of remembrance, 
all arts, all forecast, all knowledge, all wisedom, all vnderstanding, 
whereby either God is to be honored, or the world to be serued in honest 
&amp; wise sort, which so heauenlie a benefit is begon by education, 
confirmed by vse, perfited with continewance, which crouneth the hole 
work. 


</p>
               <p>Now all these abilities, whether of the first, and in most of most naturall 
sort for our being onelie, or of the second and in most of most iudiciall sort, 
for our being well, I thinke to be perfitlie furthered by this same 
Elementarie, in the natur of inducement to further encrease: and that for 
euerie abilitie in <pb n="35"/>
natur to haue vs to be such, there is som principle in this elementarie to 
make vs to be such. 


</p>
               <p>For those points, which most concern the bodie, &amp; the helth thereof, 
whether motiuelie in managing it: or morallie in manering it, what is 
ouerlept either in exercise, for practis: or in precept, for behauiour? 
Whereby whatsoeuer abilitie there is in the bodie, it is stirred and quikned 
to the verie best vse. 


</p>
               <p>As for the minde and the abilities thereof, which ar afterward to be brought 
to som perfection of habit, there is none so blind, but he planelie seith the 
ground to be laid and powers of the soull to be made most fit for most 
exquisit perfection, when those principles be obtained, which this 
Elementarie doth set down, the things themselues tending to the auancement 
of cunning, and the matter of cunning to the furtherance of vertew. 


</p>
               <p>But who shall iudge of this, that this Elementarie laieth hold vpon all those 
naturall abilities? he shall be able to saie exceding much to it, which being 
but brought vp well in the ordinarie train shall but consider this book 
aduisedlie in euerie branch thereof. But he shall iudge best of it, who hath 
bene brought vp by it, and by his own sufficiencie shall both be able to 
pronounce himself, and to cause others pronounce, by seing him so 
sufficient, that there is no point for either actiuitie in bodie, or capacitie in 
minde, whereto natur makes him toward, but that nurtur sets him foreward. 


</p>
               <p>Is the bodie made by natur nimble to run, to ride, to swim, to sense, to do 
anie thing else, which beareth praise in that kinde for either profit or 
pleasur? And doth not the Elementarie help them all forward by precept and 
train? The hand, the ear, the eie be the greatest instruments, whereby the 
receiuing and deliuerie of our learning, is chefelie executed. And doth not 
this Elementarie instruct the hand, to write, to draw, to plaie? The eie to 
read by letters, to discern by line, to iudge by both. The ear to call for 
voice, &amp; sound with proporcion for pleasur, with reason for wit? and 
generallie whatsoeuer gift natur hath bestowed vpon the bodie, to be 
brought furth or bettered by the mean of train, for anie profitable vse in our 
hole life, doth not this Elementarie both find it, and forese it? As for the 
qualities <pb n="36"/>
of the minde, whether theie tuch vertewousnesse in liuing, or skilfulnesse 
in learning, as arts, sciences, professions, or whatsoeuer else, by 
whatsoeuer term or title else, do theie not euerie one most apparentlie 
procede from reading and writing, as from their naturall principles, the one 
for deliuerie, the other for receit? whether theie trauell in language for it 
self, wherein <hi>grammer, rhetorik, logik</hi>, and their deriuatiues clame 
interest, or shew knowledge by language in anie other facultie. Where vnder 
be contained in generall terms, all the parts of <hi>philosophie</hi> both 
morall and naturall, the thre professions <hi>diuinitie, law, physik</hi>, all 
the branches of them all, all the offsprings of ech, whose instruments 
speche is. If the mathematiks be the end, or anie particular else, which 
clameth kinred of them, whose naturall end is to direct manuarie science, 
tho their translate vse be to whet a learned minde, can theie lak anie 
footing, where number, figur, motion and sound be practised in principle? 
where the mathematiks &amp; their frinds be thus induced, whose 
necessarie reason doth force their own place, can anie other facultie, whose 
but probable apparence doth entreat for a roum, but find how to enter? 
Whatsoeuer else concerneth either delite to comfort our weaknesse, or 
delitefull vse to serue our necessarie, with cunning of praise, or handling of 
art, all that is foresene either by drawing of the eie, or by musik for the ear. 
So that in my opinion, the fathers and founders of this Elementarie, whereof 
I am but collector, tho as fauourable a collector, as so good a thing 
deserueth, haue vsed great foresight to laie such foundations therein, as 
maie both nusle vp all naturall abilities, while theie ar sprooting in train, 
and perfit them at full, when theie ar ripe for the reaping. 


</p>
               <p>For the multitude &amp; varietie of those principles, which I appoint the 
young scholers to deall with, that is confirmed euen by natur hirself, which 
making hir own abilities to be so manie, requireth as manie principles to 
bring them to perfection, euerie one helping forward his cosen and frind. 
And those wise men also, which did both deuise them, and execute them in 
such a number, and of such varietie, bycaus theie wold not haue young wits 
to be ouerburdened with multitude vnwisely applyed, did help them in train 
thorough distinction in time: as the learned <pb n="37"/>
                  <hi>Quintilian</hi> doth shew in a particular discourse, where he examineth 
this question, whether young childern be to learn diuerse things at one time 
or no. Where he concludeth that theie maie, as a thing of no truble, if it be 
well deuided, bycause the younger the wits be, the better theie be fed with 
varietie: &amp; if theie be trubled somtime, or fail in somthing, yet it is 
with their mindes, as it is with their bodies, soon down and soon vp again, 
&amp; lightlie without harm, if their nurses and trainers be redie at their 
hand. For the childern, which when theie be from their ouerseers must deall 
of themselues, ar by litle and litle to be committed to themselues to learn 
to do that betimes, which theie must deall with euer after, yet while theie 
ar young, &amp; hollie vnder charge, their falts com rather by negligence of 
such, as haue charge ouer them, then of their own selues, which cannot rule 
themselues. 


</p>
               <p>If natur in som childern be not so pregnant, as theie maie take the full 
benefit of this hole train, yet by applying it wiselie, there maie be som good 
don, euen in the heauiest wits, &amp; most vnapt bodies, tho nothing so 
much as in the verie quikest. If anie parent again finding the naturall defect 
in his childe do forbear his pains, &amp; spare his purse, where he hopes for 
smal profit, he hath natur to warrant him, which semeth euen as it were 
directlie to warn him, not to lose his labor, where she lift not to fauor. 


</p>
               <p>Again if anie one wanting oportunitie cannot compas all, or hauing 
oportunitie will not medle withall, which education &amp; natur seme 
ioyntlie to promis, he hath no cause to blame either of them, whereof the 
one offered that, which he wold not vse, the other that, which he wold not 
take. But to knit vp this argument, methink it is plane, that seing natur 
offreth varietie of gifts, industrie ought to vse both hir hands to take that, 
which is offered. Which diligence in taking seing this Elementarie 
professeth, as it letteth nothing fall, which natur holdeth vp: so I take it 
therefor to be most absolut, in that it doth answer so frindlie a mother as 
natur is, and ioyns with hir in working.

               <head>That this Elementarie riddeth the course of the after learning from all difficultie and hardnesse.</head>
               <pb n="38"/>
               <p>THe fourth prouf of a good Elementarie was, in place of hardnesse to plant 
facilitie, and to lighten the course of studie by making of it plane. For what 
thing is it but hardnesse alone which most appalleth young mens courages, 
and abateth their diligence, in a maner fraing them to go anie further, when 
theie are verie well minded, towards the obtaining of sound, and 
substanciall knowledge? And what but hardnesse is the chefe and originall 
cause, why so manie rest content with simple and superficiall skill, being 
vnwilling to toill themselues with the difficulties of studie, and that ear 
theie com to fele, that small learning will serue well enough to com by a 
great liuing? which might haue bene alledged for a verie great impediment 
to greater learning, if it had gone before the feling of hardnesse: but the 
course is this. Young men desire to get learing to liue by, and while theie 
are in place of learning, as in vniuersities, bycause there theie se learning 
in best credit, theie ar in dede desirous to be noted for learning, which when 
theie cannot com by, being chekt thorough hardnesse, in the matter of 
studie, as theie think, but in dede thorough weaknesse in their first train, as 
I know, then theie deuise, how to turn that litle, which theie haue, to the 
best commoditie that theie can, and so in seking of perferment, theie ioyn 
great practises with som simple learning, as their best mean to obtain 
greater liuing. Whereas in verie dede if difficultie had not crossed them, 
theie wold haue ioyned worthinesse in themselues, with admiration in 
others, and so haue bene called by others, and not haue craued themselues. 
This hardnesse certainlie commeth bycause such students haue not bene 
brought vp in the knowledge of these Elements, which being well laid while 
childern ar yet vnder the rod, and learn as it were more by rote then by 
reason, without feeling themselues, either much pains or anie profit, will 
cause an easie and a pleasant course in the further learning, when theie can 
iudge what theie do, tho theie did it not in doing. 


</p>
               <p>For childern as theie be still in doing, so theie know not what theie do, much 
lesse wherefor theie do, till reason do grow vnto som ripenesse in them. 
And therefor the matter of their train is such, as theie profit more by 
practis, then by knowing <pb n="39"/>
why, till theie fele the vse of reason, which teacheth them to know 
considerations and causes. The foresight for their well doing in the mean 
time remains in their parents, teachers, and frinds, who prouide so for them 
in youth, as theie maie praise them again, and praie for them in age. But 
when theie themselues do grow to iudgement, hauing bene so brought vp, 
then theie do find what a great deall of good theie haue allredie don, and 
how beneficiall their frinds haue bene vnto them, for helping them so much. 
Then theie se, where other not so trained do proue stark blind. Then make 
theie no bones, where euerie litle let, is a verie great log to anie of the 
other: then march theie one at pleasur, like soldiers of courage, whose waie 
is made plane by pioners sent before, where the other, which ar not so well 
prouided for, will rather cast awaie their armor, then wrastle with the 
difficulties of vnknown and vneasie passages. 


</p>
               <p>I cannot compare the foredeall by which childern ar at, their first education 
to anie thing better, then to the pictur of <hi>Timotheus</hi> son to 
<hi>Conon</hi> the Athenian captain, and his victories, as from his ill willers 
did cause them, and him to be painted out, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth. For 
theie made <hi>Timotheus</hi> himself lying fast a slepe, and fortun bringing 
cuntries, towns, and victories vnto him in a net, meaning thereby, that he 
became such a conqueror, more by hap then by cunning, more by his enemies 
want, then by his own wit. Childern which be well trained in their youth be 
like to sleping <hi>Timotheus</hi>, preferred by their frinds, ear themselues 
can perceiue it: and their frinds like to fortun, which furnish them so well, 
ear themselues can discern, what good is don vnto them. But when theie 
com to years, and ar once awaked, then with open eies theie behold, their 
frinds care, their own conquest, and fortun fishing for them, naie Gods 
prouidence verie carefull for them, by the ministerie of parents, masters, 
and frinds, while theie were fast a slepe, and could not themselues, either 
help themselues, or iudge right of their helpers. If this Elementarie then be 
the great benefit of foreseing frinds, the great conquest of frindlie fortun, 
naie the great munificence of a louing God, who wold haue his litle ones go 
thorough stitch where ignorance makes hirs stik, is the <pb n="40"/>
thing of small regard, which hath so great patrons? is it of small 
importance, which foileth such a fo, as ignorance is? 


</p>
               <p>But to go more particularlie, is the compassing of tungs hard? sure so it is, 
to one of no foretrain, that neuer learned grammer, that neuer red writer, 
that neuer proued his stile, that neuer vsed the tung. Be the mathematiks 
hard? sure so theie be to one not prepared, that neuer did number, that 
neuer drew line, that neuer knew note, that neuer markt motion. Be the 
abilities of the bodie laborious and hard? sure that theie be, where it is 
painfull to proue, what the bodie can do, being neuer put to it. But where 
foretrain is, there ease will follow, where the bodie is prepared, the 
purgation worketh: where exercise leadeth, actiuitie will follow, both in 
those and the rest. Theie that haue these helps well grounded in their youth, 
as I said before, maie go forward with ease, and stand verie fast, where 
other must nedes stumble, which haue no such help. Which stumblers, tho by 
their own exceding great, and therefor exceding commendable trauell, theie 
oftines in the end excell those, which were better brought vp then theie 
were, yet the train was well appointed, whatsoeuer negligence disappointed 
the effect in those, which hauing wings to fly vouchsafed scant to flutter: 
and the blame resteth in them, which might haue don well and wold not, the 
praise in them, which did so well, tho theie wrastled sore for it. 


</p>
               <p>Therefor the tender minde of the young infant being first embrewed with 
these principles as the best, for the first liquor: and then furnished with 
their store, as the most, for all help, facilitie must nedes follow in all that 
doth succede. 


</p>
               <p>The opinion mentioned in <hi>Platoes Phædon</hi>, that all our learning is but 
a calling to remembrance of foreacquainted skill, the soull hauing in it 
naturallie, and from hir first being all maner of learning, tho neuer vttering 
it, but when it is moued by foren occasion, confirmeth this opinion of 
facilitie in learning, after these principles be once laid. For if the generall 
conceit in natur by waie of principle do make all knowledge to seme of old 
acquaintance, and the things thimselues to be no sooner named, then 
streight waie perceiued, as of no new familiaritie, <pb n="41"/>
no sooner hard but streight cald to remembrance, as the known 
inhabitants of naturall memorie (which kinde of perceiuing <hi>Aristotle</hi>
calleth a knowledge within vs a forehand, which knowledge, leadeth the 
strongest and the best demonstration) sure when difficultie is past in the 
first planting, which is rightlie termed the better hald of the hole, facilitie 
must nedes follow in all the residew, which seme to the principles, as of 
their acquaintance, theie follow so frindlie. So sharp an eie hath he to se 
further, whose sight is made steddie by such a preparatiue. He that in his 
Elementarie train can read and write well, he that handling the pen or 
pencill can vse them both wel by number, and with line: and dealing with 
musik can iudge well of sounds, &amp; handle instruments right, what can he 
think hard in his after studie, if studie be his choice? Naie what shall he 
find hard, tho handicraft be his end? for he maie well haue all these 
principles, yea and the <hi>mathematiks</hi> to, and yet aspire no higher, then 
the plane workman: bycause those helps be peculiar to such peple, tho for 
som quiknesse to wil, and constantnesse in prouf, theie be vsed for book 
learning. Now if he be entred into language, so far as grammer goeth, which 
is the tip of the Elementarie, will there be question of difficultie? Then all 
hardnesse being remoued in the Elementarie, before the learner can discern, 
what a foredeall he is at, and facilitie being won, where the student might 
haue stumbled, if his waie had not bene planed, what a pleasant feild hath 
studie to range in, where nothing can hinder, if loytring do no harm? Which 
loytring and negligence is allwaie excepted, as a thing that thwarteth euen 
the best deuises, &amp; commonlie cuts of all good successe, in euen the 
fairest attempts, tho it fre the thing from blame, whose furtherance it 
stoppeth, and cast the falt on him, whose hinderance it helpeth. For the 
thing remaineth one, tho the partie haue it not, the partie is the worse, 
bycause he hath not the thing, and so much the worse, bycause he is worse 
then him self, thorough his own negligence, which might haue passed 
himself, thorough his own diligence. 


</p>
               <p>I do oftimes se, and as oftimes pitie a great number of verie good students, 
which be more then half discouraged from their further proceding, when 
either theie find their own want, not <pb n="42"/>
hauing this foretrain: or being desirous to go forward ar enforced to trauell 
in these Elementarie minuts, somtimes with effect tho extreme painefull, 
oftimes with dispare and losse of all their labor. And tho theie do learn 
them, yet that their learning is nothing so sound, as vnder a teacher, 
bycause no one mans labor, in anie argument whatsoeuer, much lesse in 
these Elementarie principles, is comparable to the help that coms by a 
teacher, or a cunning reader. For is it not an incredible benefit, to haue the 
verie flour and pith of another mans studie, naie of all the best writers, 
concerning that matter wherein your trauell lyeth, to be vttered vnto you in 
order, by one that hath digested it in time, beside his painfulnesse in studie, 
to gather it from the best, and most allowed writers? I will dwell no 
longer vpon this point, bycause I haue handled it in my book of Positions, 
where I shew what benefit an vniuersitie receiueth by excellent readers. To 
my present purpose therefor. While either tediousnesse by the waie doth 
terrifie good students, or vnskilfulnesse in the end giueth idlenesse a fair 
color, to contemn where it knoweth not, the most of our best learning which 
we ought to haue (tho som fresh heads do think themselues to know enough 
and enough, when theie can said more then enough, how small enough so euer 
theie haue) is either suppressed by difficultie or oppressed by ignorance. I 
do not here tuch the want of reward, as being a foren tho a forcible let, to 
the furtherance of learning, but onelie such stops, as be within the parties, 
&amp; students themselues, which were in good waie to proue excellentlie 
sufficient, if such lets were remoued, and themselues in loue with learning 
euen for learnings sake, tho theie lookt for no dowrie. Now difficultie is a 
fair pretence to diuert one from knowledge, whom either much trauell will 
toill sore, or verie litle will soon tire: and ignorance wilbe bold to set light 
by such things, as it doth not se, bycause it is stark blind. 


</p>
               <p>Wherefor I must nedes commend this Elementarie, as most profitable for 
redinesse without difficultie in the rest of our studies, &amp; the onelie 
mean to make a pleasant passage, where such students, as be not acquainted 
therewith, ar either miserablie tormented ear that theie can passe at all, or 
quite discomfited <pb n="43"/>
without hope to passe. 


</p>
               <p>For the triall hereof I do appeall to the iudgement of two sorts of men, 
whereof either hath good feling in this matter. The one is such, as haue 
bene verie wel and perfitlie brought vp in either all, or in most of all those 
things which I do require: Of whom I ask whether theie find not in 
themselues a confortable encouragment to go forward in learning, thorough 
the help of their foretrain, and whether theie be not able, if theie will vse 
their abilitie, to go forward with great ease? The other sort is such, as 
haue bene brought vp either in none of these, or not in all, or but verie 
vnperfitlie in whatsoeuer, and be themselues verie willing to learn: Of 
whom I ask whether theie find not themselues either quite discouraged in 
their honest desire, if theie haue had no train at all: or not more then half 
lame, if theie haue had it but by halues: or not both lame and discouraged 
to, being vnperfitlie, and therefor ill trained: and whether theie do not 
striue miserablie against the stream, when theie seke to go forward 
without these helps. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Siracusian</hi> tyran being at <hi>Lacedamon</hi> and 
exercising himself by the riuer of <hi>Eurotas</hi>, as other peple did, found 
his appetite still exceeding good, and the relice of his meat exceding 
pleasant. Whereupon when he was to return to <hi>Syracusæ</hi> imputing 
the goodnesse of his stomak and the sauorinesse of his meat, to a wrong 
cause, as if theie had com of his cooks handling, &amp; not of his own 
stirring, he took with him a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi>, cook as liking of their 
diet, and allowing of their cookrie. But when he came home he took himself 
to ease, and vsed no more exercise, whereupon finding neither in his stomak 
such an appetite, nor in his meat such a relice, as he did at 
<hi>Lacedemon</hi>, he fell out with his cook, as if the salt had bene in him, 
not dressing the meat so, as he did at <hi>Lacedemon</hi>, neither bathing 
himself, as he did in <hi>Eurotas</hi>, could not haue that stomak which he had 
doing both. So must I saie by the difficultie in learning, that it will seme 
verie harsh and verie vnsauerie, to procede in depe studie, where this 
Elementarie help is not at all had, but exceding easie and <pb n="44"/>
verie delitefull, wheresoeuer it is. And tho som peple think that there is no 
such nede of anie such train, bycause all roums be serued sufficientlie 
without it: I must confese the seruice, tho I cannot the sufficiencie, which 
is but sufficient, in comparison of the lesse but mere infirmitie, where it 
might be full, &amp; perfitlie performed, ear the pains can be felt by train 
in young years. Thus much concerning the facilitie which this Elementarie 
promiseth to the course of studie, and therewithall encreaseth 
commendation to it self.

               <p>THe fift praise of this Elementarie was, bycause it is the best mean to avoid 
generall ignorance, the mother to misliking, and to com by generall 
knowledge, which is the cause of knowledge, which is the cause of 
allowance. A circumstance of great moment in the prouince of learning, as 
it is generallie also in all other dealings. For that which is misliked, is 
still vnder foot, and that which is allowed is allwaie aloft. Now all 
misliking commeth either vpon desert, when the thing is such, as for verie 
naughtinesse it is to be misliked, or vpon opinion, when error in the partie 
misliketh that thing, which is of it self well worthie the liking. 


</p>
               <p>Opinion falls in error either thorough mere ignorance, when he that 
misliketh, knoweth not what the thing is, which he doth mislike, or else 
thorough preiudice, when he that misliketh doth know the thing well, but is 
so wedded vnto, naie rather so bewitched with his own fantsie, which it 
self is seduced by som foren allurement, as he will rather mislike against 
knowledge, then withstand against fantsie. 


</p>
               <p>As for the matter of learning, wherein our studie consisteth, and whereunto 
these principles make a redie entrance, our necessarie vse both bred it at 
the first, and contineweth it still, in verie good credit. And what man is so 
simple, but he knoweth it to be such, as deserueth good liking: both for the 
seruice that it doth vs, which is the naturall end of it, and for the proprietie 
in handling, which is an artificiall mean to it? Wherefore if with out cause 
it be otherwise charged by anie color of blame either <pb n="45"/>
in all or in part, opinion is the charger, which opinion in so doing is either 
blinded by ignorance, or corrupted by fantsie, the verie worst branch of anie 
kinde of error, not minding to amend and still waxing worse, as both the two 
be verie great enemies to all right iudgement. If anie kinde of writer for 
vaunt, not for want of wit, or vpon som particular cause else, do practis his 
pen or whet his tung against the good in learning, as <hi>Lucian</hi> doth in 
most places of hole works, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> doth in his vane book of 
vanities in science, theie cannot wound learning, tho theie strike at the 
wants, which be in som professors. Bycause tho the two qualities, one of 
good note, and to be well vsed, as learning and knowledge, the other of ill 
note, and neuer but naught, as vice and misdemeanor, be in one &amp; the 
same partie, yet as the good qualitie cannot transubstantiate the euill, so 
can not the euill change the others substance, tho it foullie disfigur the 
form thereof, which is so much the worse, bycause of such a companion, 
whom the qualified partie, as subiect vnto both hath matched so togither, 
being in natur most different, tho vnited in the person, as a common harbour 
to two great enemies, whereof the one seketh the subuersion of the other. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syphax</hi> the king of Barbarie, as <hi>Liuie</hi> reporteth, lodged both 
<hi>Scipio &amp; Hasdrubal</hi> in one palace, being two mortall enemies, and 
euen at that time in most cruell war, <hi>Scipio</hi> for Rome, 
<hi>Dasdrubal</hi> for Carthage. But what came of it? the king being 
persuaded by <hi>Scipios</hi> presence, &amp; his graue speche, began to 
falter in his amitie with his own frinds, the peple of Carthage, &amp; 
proceding so forward in that his mutabilitie, at the last chused the worst. 
For being the first mouer to haue the Romanes armie passe ouer into 
<hi>Afrik</hi>, he wrought the ouerthrow to Carthage &amp; reuolting again 
from the Romanes frindship to the peple of Carthage he ouerthrew himself, 
&amp; lost kingdom &amp; all. Such a thing it is to harbor two enemies, 
&amp; to geue ear to both, where the infirmitie of our natur, either cannot 
well iudge of them, or if it can, yet is lightlie conquered by the worst of the 
two, howsoeuer it promis the more honorable gest, to ioyn with the better. 
If learning and vice do lodge in one room, the allurement of vice will lightlie 
preuaill against the allegation of learning, and enforce the learned to do 
against his knowledge, <pb n="46"/>
&amp; yet learning is still good, tho the professor go awrie, and tho 
cauilling wits do translate crimes from the offender to the innocent. But 
such fellowes bewraie their own folie, euen in ieast to turn their heles 
against their own helps, and by their fond doing to stir som fond heads, to 
mislike that in earnest, which theie ment but in ieast. This doing of both 
<hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi>, and anie such else, which ieast so with 
good things, to the shaking of their credit, so much as lyeth in them, maie be 
iustlie comrised vnder error in opinion nor erroniouslie but wantonlie 
seduced. But what if that wanton seduction be the worst of all other, and 
worthie to be punished? whereas of the other two, the one is moned in 
ignorance, the other but blamed in error. 


</p>
               <p>But to return to my former argument, what greater enemies hath learning 
euen in natur, then preiudice &amp; ignorance? whence is there more open 
shew of implacable hostilitie to knowledge, then from preiudice and 
ignorance? Ignorance knoweth nothing, and therefore is no friend to ane 
vnknown good: preiudice knoweth and will not, and therefor is a great fo to 
a not fauored good. Ignorance yet in part deserueth som excuse for all hir 
disfrindship, bycause infirmitie is hir falt, not bolstered with ill will, and 
the worst is hir own, ane ordinarie case, where euen enimitie pityeth. But 
preiudice is a poison to anie comon weall, so far as it stretcheth, which 
being at the first infected with the incurable disease of a cankred and a 
corrupt opinion gathered by confluence of sundrie ill humors will neither it 
self yeild to a right iudgement, nor will suffer anie other, where hir 
persuasion can take place. For by yeilding hir self she feareth the emparing 
of hir misconceiued estimation, and by suffring other to yeild, she feareth 
the encrease of knowledges frinds, whereby hir self shall com in danger to 
be oppressed, both with truth of matter, and number of patrons. Wherefor 
she opposeth hir self, she bendeth all hir eloquence, she mureth vp all 
passages, so much as she maie, both by persuasion and entreatie, that none 
shall iudge right, which will hear hir speak, &amp; regard hir autoritie, but 
shall take that musik to sound the swetest, which commeth from hir, tho 
she be but a mear-maid, which by offring of delite endeuoreth to destroie. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47"/>Ignorance is violent and like vnto a lion, when it encountreth with 
knowledge, still in furie without feling, in rage without reason, and riseth 
of two causes, either infirmitie in natur, or negligence in labor. Whereof 
the one could not, the other wold not conceiue at the first, when knowledge 
was in dealing. Both enemies to knowledge, but negligence the greater, 
which either fearing disdain for hir first refusall, or enuying him which 
loueth where she left, will not seme to fauor, where she once forsook, and 
stomaketh him, which embraceth hir leauings, awraking hir malice in shew 
vpon knowledge, in dede vpon folie. Which folie being lodged within hir own 
breast, beside that negligent ignorance, vseth to call in a dangerous opinion, 
the contempt of that good, which she ought to commend, rather then she will 
by change of opinion and altring hir hew, bewraie her own error, which all 
men se sauing she that should: being at defiance with knowledge, not by 
simplicitie of natur, which offered, but by naughtinesse of choice, which 
refused the attaining thereof. 


</p>
               <p>Now naturall infirmitie the other and more gentle mean of ignorance wold 
perhaps, naie wold in dede change hir blind opinion, if she could once change 
hir ingenerate heauinesse: she wold reuerence learning, if she might se hir 
beawtie, where with to be rauished, being enemie vnto hir, not of malice but 
of weaknesse. 


</p>
               <p>That which I speake of infirmitie in natur, and nelgigence in choice is to be 
entended by such of both sorts, as continew in their worst without remorse 
of euill, or recourse to good. For if anie man whether naturallie dull or 
negligentlie rude in riper years vpon better aduise do change his currant: 
the naturall weak to loue that in others, which he hath not himself: the 
negligentlie rude to wish that in himself, which he seith to be in others, he 
then becoms frind to iudgement, and will rather continew in suspense, then 
pronounce rashlie, till he be thoroughlie enforced. 


</p>
               <p>But that same peruerse preiudice is a sutle fo to knowledge like a 
manieheaded <hi>hydra</hi>, and as the venim of his autoritie is gathered of 
diuerse grounds, so the sting of his poison infecteth diuerse waies. The 
person himself which is thus caried a waie <pb n="48"/>
by a peuish opinion is commonlie no heauie head, but either superficiallie 
learned, and yet loth to seme so: or enuiouslie affected and still carping at 
his better: or ambitiouslie giuen and presumeth vpon countenance: or he 
measureth knowledge by gain, and setteth naught by anie more, that himself 
shall nede, to compas that he coueteth, where a litle cuning will compas 
much more then reason thinks enough in corruption of mindes. All which 
four causes mean learning glad to make great shew, enuious affection 
glancing at good things: vane presumption plaing the peicok: couetous 
desire carelesse of great cunning, as theie corrupt the iudgement, so theie 
maintain preiudice, while the partie so corrupted will seeke by all means to 
continew his credit: so much the more a deadlie enemie to knowledge, 
bycause preiudice must giue place, if knowledge com in place, and therefor 
that it maie not com, he emploieth all his forces, by all cunning, and all well 
colored shifts to shoulder it out: a professed fo, and so much the shrewder, 
bycause he supplanteth knowledge vnder the opinion of knowledge. 


</p>
               <p>Now considering these so firie and so furious enemies to knowledge, 
ignorance and preiudice with their hole families be the causes why, that the 
best things &amp; matters of most cunning be oftimes misliked, where theie 
be vnknown, either simplie or shrewdlie, doth not this Elementarie a great 
pleasur to knowledge, by planting skill in all, to auoid misliking in anie? 
that euerie part of knowledge maie be so estemed of, as it iustlie deserues? 
and ech of these mislikers maie be so entreated, as to becom frinds of foes? 


</p>
               <p>Misliking was said to com either of deseruing ill, whereof learning is clear, 
bycause it deserues well, or else by error, from which kinde of misliking 
anie sound knowledge will verie hardlie scape. For ignorance supported by 
infirmitie in natur, and negligence in labor, and preiudice maintained by four 
craftie companions, superficiall learning, enuious affection, vainglorious 
conceit, and couetous desire will still haue a fling at hir. Howbeit if 
naturall infirmitie be helpt by diligent education, it will either proue a 
frind or not bitter fo, for that good which it hath goten. If negligence it self 
be so entreated in the training, as it will be content to take pains to learn, 
it will fauour <pb n="49"/>
at the last, tho it frown at the first. If preiudice in generall maie 
compas and kepe that credit, with sound and substantiall knowlege, which it 
aspireth vnto by superficiall shew and sinister means, were not he worse 
then mad, that wold hang vpon the shadow, where he might haue the bodie, 
being still in danger to haue his vnskilfulnesse discouered at euerie 
encounter with a learneder man? at euerie dealing with anie such matter, 
as will bewraie a smatterer? By help of this elementarie will this 
substance be goten, that the shew shall not nede. For this kinde of training 
vp in youth doth crepe on to knowlege, ear the feling of labor can take anie 
place, and encrocheth so sore vpon blind ignorance, as it cannot be painfull, 
no not to negligent heads, being so well set forward, to passe quite thorough 
without either difficultie or danger, if he set not man to work but good will 
alone. Which being don will not misliking be banished, and liking be cald 
home? will not ignorance stowp when knowledge is in state? when the end 
is well wrought, and by right means, which was sought for before by a verie 
wrong waie? I shall not nede to repeat here again, to what kinde of 
knowlege euerie principle helpeth. For in that theie expell ignorance 
eueriewhere, that serues for this purpos, as, that theie help knowledge 
euerie where, it is a thing proued all redie. Both which, the help to 
knowledge, and exile to ignorance, found much to the praise of these fiue 
principles, wherewith theie procure liking to learning, and valur to vertew.

               <head>That the entrie to language and the iudgement thereof by grammer is the end of the Elementarie.</head>
               <p>THe sixt and last prouf of perfitnesse in this elementarie was, bycause the 
entrance of language, and the iudgement thereof, which is wrought by 
grammer, is the conclusion and height thereof. Which how profitable a thing 
it is, the effects themselues will euidentlie declare. For by course of natur 
and vse of antiquitie, grammer trauelleth first to haue the naturall tung of 
ech cuntrie fined to that best, and most certain direction, which the 
ordinarie custom of that cuntrie <pb n="50"/>
which vseth the tung, can lead hir vnto: As how to reduce our English tung 
to som certain rule, for writing and reading, for words and speaking, for 
sentence and ornament, that men maie know, when theie write or speak 
right. Which direction was both the first, and the most ancient vse of the 
originall grammer. Whose professors bycause of their iudgement were 
called <hi>Critici</hi>, as <hi>Aristarchus</hi> among the grekes, <hi>Palamon</hi>
among the Romanes. Secondlie grammer, as it hath bene vsed sence, seketh 
to help vs to the knowledge of foren language, as the <hi>Latin</hi>, the 
<hi>Italian</hi>, and such other tungs, which at this daie is the principall vse 
thereof. Where it serueth in the natur of an anatomie, for the resoluing of 
the writen speche: in the natur of an artificer, for making vp the habit of a 
foren tung in the studious learner, by writing and speaking. Now in either of 
these kindes, whether to fine our own tung, or to learn a foren, we ar much 
bound to grammer, euen for it self alone, but a great deall more in respect 
of hir professor, which must perform the three things, that I named before 
of his own abilitie. For grammer of it self is but the bare fule, and a verie 
naked thing, but the professour must haue somwhat more then his rule. 


</p>
               <p>And (not to medle here at this time with anie foren tung, for either the one 
or the other part of grammer) doth it not I praie you, shew vs Englishmen a 
verie great pleasur, if it help to the fining of our own English tung, &amp; 
thereby to make it to be of such account, as other tungs be, which be 
therefor of best account, bycause theie be so fined? whereby we our selues 
also shall seme not to be barbarous, euen by mean of our tung, seing fair 
speche is som parcell of praise, and a great argument of a well ciuilled 
peple. But it pleasureth vs a great deall more, as the curse of our studie 
now lyeth, for helping of vs to foren language, by such good helps, as it 
ioyneth to it self, bysides the bare Anatomie of a plane rule. For a mere 
grammarian is but a poor mean to do anie thing well, euen where he 
professeth most: as <hi>Quintilian</hi> saw verie well, which for the latin 
tung, and the grammarian therein said, that it is was <note>sic</note> one 
thing to speak like a gramarian, and another thing to speak like a latinist, as 
if grammer latin were but latin by dispensation: &amp; onelie hit the right 
in <pb n="51"/>
euerie tung, which could both waie the rules, and pease the force of speche 
according to that grace, which euerie tung hath. But forasmuch as grammer 
is vsed for one degre in help to foren language, it furthereth vs verie much 
that waie, bycause all our learning being set from the foren, as regestred in 
their tungs, if we want the knowledge of the one, we want the hope of the 
other. 


</p>
               <p>When learning, and knowledge came first to light, those men, which were 
the autors thereof, vttered their mindes in that same speche, which theie 
then vsed, when theie bred the things. And as theie neded no foren tung for 
the matter bred at home, so had theie no other vse of anie grammer, but 
onelie that, which endeuoured to fine their naturall speche at home. But 
after that the same their deuises, being first set out in their own tungs, 
were afterward sought for by foren students, to encrease their learning, and 
to enrich their cuntrie with foren wares, the foren students were then 
driuen to vse the assistence of grammer in the second kinde, bycause theie 
could not vnderstand those things, which were writen in a foren tung, 
without the knowledge of the tung it self. 


</p>
               <p>In the primitiue grammer children being framed so, as I require now, went 
straight waie from the Elementarie to matter of learning, and the 
mathematicall sciences, which ar so termed, bycause in dede the whole 
scholers learning (which scholers in greke ar called 
<foreign xml:lang="el">mahytai</foreign>) consisted in them, as in the 
first degree of right studie. For whatsoeuer goeth before them in right 
studie, is nothing else at all, but mere Elementarie: and whatsoeuer goeth 
before them in wrong studie, as it is wrested in natur, so it worketh no 
great wonder. But in the second vse of grammer, we are enforced of 
necessitie, after the Elementarie howsoeuer hudled vp, and how simple 
soeuer, to deall with the tungs, ear we passe to anie matter, which help of 
tungs, tho it be most necessarie for the thing, as our studie is now platted, 
yet it hindreth vs in a time a thing of great price, naie it hindreth vs in 
knowledge a thing of more price. For by the lingring about language, we are 
remoued and kept bak one degre further from sound knowledge, which is so 
great a degre, being in our best learning time, while we be vnder masters 
and <pb n="52"/>
readers, of whom we maie learn far better, then of our selues, if that regard 
be had to them in choice, which elswhere I haue wished were carefullie had. 
But I will not deall anie further with grammer in this place, considering 
that hole argument will follow this Elementarie, and hath so manie 
branches, as we dealt with tungs: neither yet will I procede with this 
discourse, which offereth it self here concerning the let of studie, by the 
studie of tungs, which tungs seme to be the onelie mean to all our studie, as 
we vse it at this daie, bycause I haue handled that argument alreadie in the 
preface to my learned and curteous reader, besides that I haue tuched it in 
my book of Positions. For this time this maie suffice, that this our 
Elementarie is verie beneficiall vnto vs, by the mean of gramer also, which 
is the honor and perfection of the Elementarie in both hir naturs, but 
chefelie in the course of our learning now, whereby we ar entred into 
language, and withall into knowledge, while our own tung remaineth but 
poor, and is kept verie low thorough som reasonable superstition, not to 
haue learning in it. 


</p>
               <p>But here to conclude the generall vse of this present Elementarie, which 
hath bene thus far my particular argument, I must nedes continew my first 
opinion, which was and is this, that in the matter of learning, a good 
Elementarie is more then the half, bycause it is the first: &amp; that in the 
first it is mere the best, bycause the wisest men, the greatest reasons, the 
best gouerned common wealls did so pronounce of it, the one by their pen, 
the other by their practis.

               <head>The generall platform and method of the hole Elementarie.</head>
               <p>I Will set down the purtrait of the hole Elementarie, and how I purpos to 
deall therein, before I medle with anie particular principle, that my reader 
seing my hole plat in so small a form, and no parcell thereof but within his 
compas, maie the sooner perceiue the drift of my labor, and accordinglie 
frame his hope of the thing, and the good like to com by it, &amp; staie his 
memorie the better, by the method &amp; order which I promis to kepe in it. 
I deuide the consideration of the hole Elementarie <pb n="53"/>
into two parts, whereof the first concerneth the matter and 
substance thereof, and how I entend to deall therein: the second concerneth 
the maner and form of teaching it, and how I wish that euerie circumstance 
were handled, that both the teacher maie deliuer planelie with order, and 
the learner receiue quiklie with profit. Wherefor the first part of this my 
generall plat shall shew the matter of the Elementarie, and the handling 
thereof: the second shall shew the maner of teaching, and the 
circumstances therein. 


</p>
               <p>The matter of the hole Elementarie consisting in fiue points: <hi>reading, 
writing, drawing, singing, &amp; playing</hi>, I will so handle them in rew, 
as, I marshall them in order, and begin first at <hi>reading</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>But bycause I take vpon me in this Elementarie, besides som frindship to 
secretaries for the pen, and to correctors for the print, to direct such peple, 
as teach childern to read and write English, and the <hi>reading</hi> must 
nedes be such, as the writing leads vnto, therefor, befor I medle with anie 
particular precept, to direct the Reader, I will thoroughlie rip vp the hole 
certaintie of our English writing, so far furth and with such assurance, as 
probabilitie can make me, bycause it is a thing both proper to my argument, 
and profitable to my cuntrie. For our naturall tung being as beneficiall vnto 
vs for our nedefull deliuerie, as anie other is to the peple which vse it: 
&amp; hauing as pretie, and as fair obseruations in it, as anie other hath: 
and being as readie to yeild to anie rule of Art, as anie other is: why should 
I not take som pains, to find out the right writing of ours, as other 
cuntrimen haue don, to find the like in theirs? &amp; so much the rather, 
bycause it is pretended, that the writing thereof is meruellous vncertain, 
and scant to be recouered from extreme confusion, without som change of as 
great extremitie? I mean therefor so to deall in it, as I maie wipe awaie 
that opinion of either vncertaintie for confusion, or impossibilitie for 
direction, that both the naturall English maie haue wherein to test, &amp; 
the desirous stranger maie haue whereby to learn. For the performance 
whereof, and mine own better direction, I will first examin those means, 
whereby other tungs of most sacred antiquitie haue bene brought to Art and 
form of discipline for their right writing, to the end that by following their 
waie, I maie hit vpon <pb n="54"/>
their right, and at the least by their president deuise the like to theirs, 
where the vse of our tung, &amp; the propertie of our dialect will not yeild 
flat to theirs. That don I will set all the varietie of our now writing, &amp; 
the vncertaine force of all our letters in as much certaintie, as anie writing 
can be, by these seuen precepts, <hi>Generall rule</hi>, which concerneth the 
propertie and vse of ech letter: <hi>Proportion</hi>, which reduceth all words 
of one sound to the same writing. <hi>Composition</hi>, which teacheth how 
to write one word made of mo: <hi>Deriuation</hi>, which examineth the 
ofspring of euerie originall: <hi>Distinction</hi> which bewraieth the 
difference of sound, and force in letters by som writen figure or accent: 
<hi>Enfranchisement</hi>, which directeth the right writing of all incorporat 
form foren words: <hi>Prerogatiue</hi>, which declareth a reseruation, 
wherein common vse will continew hir precedence in our English writing, as 
she hath don euerie where else, both for the form of the letter, in som 
places, which likes the pen better: and for the difference in writing, where 
som particular caueat will chek a common rule. In all these seuen I will so 
examin the particularities of our tung, as either nothing shall seme strange 
at all, or if anie thing do seme, yet it shall not seme so strange, but that 
either the self same, or the verie like vnto it, or the more strange then it is 
shal appear to be in those things, which ar more familiar vnto vs for 
extraordinarie learning, then required of vs for our ordinarie vse. And 
forasmuch as the eie will help manie to write right by a sene president, 
which either cannot vnderstand, or cannot entend to vnderstand the reason 
of a rule, therefor in the end of this treatis for right writing, I purpos to set 
down a generall table of most English words, by waie of president, to help 
such plane peple, as cannot entend the vnderstanding of a rule, which 
requireth both time and conceit in perceiuing, but can easilie run to a 
generall table, which is readier to their hand. By the which table I shall 
also confirm the right of my rules, that theie hold thoroughout, &amp; by 
multitude of examples help som maim in precepts. Thus much for the right 
writing of our English tung, which maie seme for a preface to the principle 
of <hi>Reading</hi>, as the matter of the one is the maker of the other. 


</p>
               <p>In <hi>reading</hi> I will kepe this order, bycause the treatis of right <pb n="55"/>
writing doth pretend som help to the right in <hi>reading</hi>, I will first giue 
certain rules, to be obserued in <hi>reading</hi> and spelling, according to 
those precepts, which I gaue in writing. And forsomuch as the goodnesse 
and vertew of matter is most fit for the young childe in the first seasoning 
of his tender minde: and the matter it self is spred into two branches, 
consonant vnto the main distinction of the ten commandements, either for 
religion towards God, and right opinion in faith: or for ciuilitie towards 
men, and right iudgement in behauior: I will therefor cast the matter of 
<hi>reading</hi> so, as it shall answer at full both to religion in faith, and to 
ciuilitie in frindship. Wherefor to laie the first ground of learning, which is 
to learn to read, in religion towards God, and in religion it self to obserue 
the law and ordinances of my cuntrie, I will after the A b c, set down the 
ordinarie catechism set furth by my prince, and the state of my cuntrie, 
with all such appendants for graces, and other praiers, as shall seme most 
pertinent to the Elementarie training of a christian child. Therevnto I will 
ioyn som other pretie short treatis concerning the same religious argument 
being of good importance for those years to vnderstand: and as warilie 
appointed, as God shall appoint me. Then will I set down som other well 
pikt discourse, which shall concern morall behauior, and right opinions that 
waie. In all which I will haue both a speciall, &amp; a continuall regard to 
these four points in the child, his <hi>memorie</hi>, his <hi>desire</hi>, his 
<hi>capacitie</hi>, and his <hi>forwarding</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>For his <hi>memorie</hi> I will forese, that as he must practis it euen from 
the first, so he maie also practis it euen vpon the best, both for pleasur in 
learning, and for profit after learning. 


</p>
               <p>For his <hi>delite</hi>, which is no mean allurement to his learning well, I 
will be as carefull that the matter which he shall read, maie be so fit for 
his years, &amp; so plane to his wit, as when he is at school, he maie desire 
to go forward in so comfortable an argument, and when he commeth home, he 
maie take great pleaur to be telling of his parents, what pretie petie things 
he doth find in his book, and that the parents also maie haue no lesse delite 
to hear their litle one speak. In so much as either of them shall rather seke 
to preuent the other, the childe to be telling <pb n="56"/>
somwhat, and the parent to be asking somwhat, then to be so slow, as to 
tarie for the mouing. 


</p>
               <p>For his <hi>capacitie</hi> I will so prouide, that the matter which he shall 
learn, maie to be so easie to vnderstand, and the phrase which I will vse, so 
euident to perceiue, as both the one and the other shall cause nothing but 
courage. 


</p>
               <p>For his <hi>forwarding</hi> I mean to be somwhat curious, that there be such 
consideration and choice for syllabs words and sentences, and for all their 
accidentarie notes, as there shall want nothing, which maie seme worth the 
wishing, for the full help of either spelling trew, or reading sure: that what 
childe soeuer can read them well, maie read anie thing else well, if the 
reading master will kepe that order in his teaching, which I entend to giue 
him in my precept, and do his infant no harm by hasting him on to fast, 
&amp; by measuring his forwardnesse not by his own knowlege, but by 
fantsie of his frinds. If opportunitie serue me &amp; cause require that 
labor, I will pen the same things in the latin tung also, to satisfie som 
peple, which wilbe best pleased so, as in verie dede sauing for the 
ortografie, which is proper to our tung, there is nothing in the Elementarie, 
but it maie well be communicated with anie foren nation, which must 
likewise prouide for their peculiar ortografie, as I do for ours, if theie mean 
to vse the like Elementarie to this. 


</p>
               <p>The treatis of <hi>reading</hi> being thus ended, then will I on to the principle 
of <hi>writing</hi>, wherein I shall nede neither to be curious, ne yet long, 
bycause the hole ortografie, which concerneth the right writing of our tung, 
will both help the writing master, &amp; ease my labor in that behalf. 
Howbeit whatsoeuer shal be nedefull to that end besides the rules, which ar 
giuen in the ortografie (as there be manie pretie notes, for the writers 
profession, both to frame the childes hand right, to form &amp; ioyn letters 
well, &amp; to fit those instruments, which he must nedes vse in the 
managing, thereof all that I will set furth most planelie, and as shortlie, for 
both the English and the latin letter. I ioyn the latin letter with the English, 
bycause the time to learn the latin tung is next in order after the 
Elementarie, and the childes hand is then to be acquainted with the latin 
charact, which is nothing so combersom as the English charact is, if it be 
not far more easie. <pb n="57"/>
And tho we vse to learn som other tungs afterward, as well as latin, which 
haue the peculiar characts, as the <hi>greke</hi> and <hi>hebrew</hi>, yet he 
that can write English and latin well, will learn those hands both soon, and 
of himself. So that the Elementarie wrting shall not nede to truble it self 
anie further in the Elementarie time of learning, then with those two tungs, 
the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>latin</hi>. If other ordinarie trades do require 
mo hands, as for the vse of som court, and such other like, the writing 
master maie help him self, with the particular form of the hand, that is 
sought for, as I will help him with rules in anie writing at all, of 
whatsoeuer form, tho I make choice but of two onelie. But here methink I 
find honest mens diligence verie sore mismatched, with an intricate waie 
and most wearisom to themselues. For theie spend their hole time about 
setting of copies, whereas fewer copies, and more loking to his hand wold 
help the childe more, as the number of copie occupying the hole time, is 
mere enemie to amendment, an direction of the hand. I will therefor, 
bycause I like that best, set down two tables of the <hi>English</hi> &amp; the 
<hi>latin</hi> tung, with the letters, ioynings, &amp; what so else shalbe 
necessarie for one perpetuall copie. The argument whereof shalbe such for 
choice, as it shall deserue the remembring, which the oft writing will 
easilie procure, &amp; the warinese shalbe such for certaintie of letter, for 
varietie of form, for all kindes of ioyning, as he, that can write &amp; 
resemble those two copies well, shal think nothing strange, that doth 
concern writing. So much diligence shalbe vsed in the choice of a few lines, 
which must plant an habit. Further because it shalbe good for the writing 
master, to haue tables in store, tho he occupie them not allwaie, I will set 
him down two other tables, of the like choice for the <hi>greke</hi> and 
<hi>hebrew</hi>. And if I shall think it conuenient to translate my English 
reading arguments into latin, I will also help the Elementarie latin master, 
with all such notes, as maie teach to read latin, that in great ignorance of 
the tung, yet he shall not lightlie fail, either in tuning or timing euen of 
vnknown words. Why I do like these tables better, then the multitude of 
copies, I will shew more at large in the particular handling of the writing 
principle, bycause in that point I am somwhat contrarie to manie of those, 
which teach children to write, whose commoditie <pb n="58"/>
I hinder not, tho I help their scholers more, whose labor I lessen not, 
tho I releace it from copies. This don I must teach how to <hi>draw</hi>. 
Which <hi>drawing</hi> bycause it is not so euidentlie profitable, nor so 
generallie receiued, as <hi>writing &amp; reading</hi> be, I will therefor proue 
in a pretie short discourse both how profitable it is, &amp; how it deserueth 
the learning, euen for profit sake, besides manie petie plesurs. Then 
bycause <hi>drawing</hi> vseth both number &amp; figur, wherewithall to 
work, I will cull out so much number &amp; figur, wherewithall to work, I 
will cull out so much numbring from out of <hi>Arithmetik</hi>, the mistresse 
of numbers, &amp; so much figuring out of <hi>Geometrie</hi> the ladie of 
figurs, as shall serue fit for an Elementarie principle to the childes 
drawing, without either hardnesse to fraie him, or length to tire him. 
Whatsoeuer shall belong to coloring, to shadowing, &amp; such more 
workmanlie points, bycause theie ar nearer to the painter, then to the 
drawing learner, I will reserue them to the after habit, &amp; to the 
students choice, when he is to diuert, &amp; to betake himself to som one 
trade of life. At which time, if he chaunce to chuse the pen &amp; pencil to 
liue by, this introduction then will proue his great frind, as he himself shall 
find, when he feles it in prouf. Last of all forsomuch as <hi>drawing</hi> is a 
thing, whose thorough help manie good workmen do vse, which liue honestlie 
thereby, &amp; in good degre of estimation &amp; welth, as <hi>architectur, 
pictur, embroderie, engrauing, statuarie</hi> all <hi>modeling</hi> all 
<hi>platforming</hi>, &amp; manie the like: besides the learned vse thereof, 
for <hi>Astronomie, Geometrie, Chorographie, Topographie</hi> and som other 
such, I will therefor pik out som certain figures proper to so manie of the 
foresaid faculties, as shall seme most fit to teach a child to <hi>draw</hi>, 
&amp; withall I will shew how theie be to be delt with euen from their first 
point, to their last perfection, seing it is out of all controuersie, that, if 
drawing be thought nedefull, as it shall be proued to be, it is now to be delt 
with, while the finger is tender, &amp; the writing yet in hand, that both the 
pen &amp; pencill, both the rule &amp; compas, maie go forward together. 


</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Musik</hi>, which I haue deuided into voice and instrument, I will 
kepe this currant. The training vp in <hi>musik</hi> as in all other faculties, 
hath a speciall eie to these thre points: The childe himself, that is to learn: 
the matter it self, which he is to learn: and the instrument it self, whereon 
he is to learn. Wherein I will deall so for the first and last, that is for the 
childe and <pb n="59"/>
the instrument, as neither of them shall lak, whatsoeuer is nedefull, either 
for framing of the childes voice, or for the righting of his finger, or for the 
prikking of his lessons, or for the tuning of his instrument. For in the voice 
there is a right pitch, that it be neither ouer nor vnder strained, but 
delicatelie brought to hir best ground, both to kepe out long, &amp; to rise or 
fall within dew compas, and so to becom tunable, with regard to helth, and 
pleasant to hear. And in the fingering also, there is a regard to be had, both 
that the childe strike so, as he do not shufle, neither spoill anie sound, and 
that his finger run so both sure and sightlie, as it cumber not it self with 
entangled deliuerie. Where of the first commonlie falleth out by to much 
hast, in the young learner, who is euer longing vntill be a leauing: the 
second falt coms of the master himself, who doth not consider the naturall 
dexteritie, and sequele in the ioynts, which being vsed right, &amp; in a 
naturall consequence, procureth the finger a nimblenesse with ease, and 
helpeth the deliuerie to readinesse without pain, as the vntoward fingring 
must nedes bring in corruption, tho corrupt vse do not vse to complain. For 
the matter of <hi>musik</hi>, which the childe is to learn, I will set it down 
how, and by what degres &amp; in what lessons, a boy that is to be brought 
vp to sing, maie &amp; ought to procede by ordinarie ascent, from the first 
term of Art, &amp; the first note in sound, vntill he shalbe able without anie 
often or anie great missing, to sing his part in priksong, either himself 
alone, which is his first in rudenesse, or with som companie, which is his 
best in practis. For I take so much to be enough for an Elementarie 
institution, which saluteth but the facultie, tho it perfit the principle, 
&amp; I refer the residew for setting &amp; discant to encrease of cunning, 
which dailie will grow on, &amp; to further years, when the hole bodie of 
<hi>musik</hi> wil com, &amp; craue place. And yet bycause the childe must 
still mount somwhat that waie, I will set him down som rules of setting 
&amp; discant, which will make him better able to iudge of fingring being a 
setter himself, as in the tung, he that vseth to write, shal best iudge of a 
writer. Concerning the <hi>virginalls</hi> &amp; the <hi>lute</hi>, which two 
instruments, I haue therfor chosen, bycause of the full <hi>musik</hi> which is 
vttered by them &amp; the varietie of fingring, which is shewed vpon them, I 
will also set down so manie chosen lessons for either of them, as shall 
bring the young learner <pb n="60"/>
to plaie reasonable well on them both, tho not at the first sight, 
whether by the ear, or by the book, allwaie prouided that priksong go before 
plaing. All which lessons both for instrument &amp; voice, I wil not onelie 
name, and set the learner ouer to get them, where he can, in the writen song 
books set furth by <hi>musik</hi> masters, but I will cause them all to be 
prikt and printed in the same principle of <hi>musik</hi>, that both the reader 
maie iudge of them, and the scholer learn by them. Which thing as well as 
all the rest, that I haue vndertaken to perform in this Elementarie, I hope by 
Gods help to bring to such effect thorough conference, with the best 
practitioners in our time, and the counsell of the best learned writers in 
anie time, in euerie of the principles, besides mine own trauell, and som not 
negligent experience, as I shall discharge my promis, and content my good 
cuntrimen. What thing soeuer else besides this that I haue named, shall 
seme to be nedefull for the better opening of anie particular point, I will se 
to it there, tho I saie nothing of it here. This is the som of my Elementarie 
platform for the matter thereof. 


</p>
               <p>For the maner of teaching and consideration of circumstance in executing 
thereof, which was the second party of my generall plat in my first diuision, 
&amp; hath the same place, if not a greater in the particular performance of 
anie execution (for what auaileth precept, if it be not performed? or what 
performance is it, that procedeth not in order?) I entend to do thus. Bycause 
all these things tho neuer so good of themselues, tho neuer so commended by 
writers, tho neuer so well liked of parents, yet maie miscarie in the 
handling, if theie be not well followed with all dew circumstances, I will 
therefor set down a particular direction for euerie principle, when to begin, 
and in what degre of ripenesse to ioyn with another, and that so as neither 
to soon mar, nor to much confound: how to handle the young with: how to 
ioyn exercise of the bodie with these principles for the mind: what method 
in teaching them maie seme to be best: what pretie deuises must be vsed to 
cause the childe of himself shew what he can do, and what metle there is in 
him, with all such considerations as be naturallie incident to such an 
execution, that the young learner maie both thank me for his helth, and think 
well of me for his learning, as a willing instrument <pb n="61"/>
to do him som good, if it shall please God, the giuer of good, to blesse mine 
endeuor. Thus much for my generall plat. In the performance whereof, tho I 
do somtimes enterlace discourses, that be not for children, either to 
conceiue or cun, yet theie be not impertinent to the matter, neither 
improper to me, somtime to open some further point necessarie to my 
purpos: somtime to enstruct the masters, which might either misconceiue 
me, or misorder the teaching: somtimes euen to se how our English tung 
will plaie with these arguments, which ar thought so vncouth, and not 
expressible in our tung. But what so euer shal be necessarie for the childes 
trauell alone, I will so appoint that, as it shall stand alone, and maie be 
printed alone, the larger discourses seruing for more years, and such as will 
vse them. For that I take to be the best method in penning anie thing, 
wherof the student is to commit part to memorie, &amp; to studie the other 
part, to make the remembring part, pithie, short, and apart, and in the other 
to handle the rest at large, &amp; yet no more then nedefull. Which two 
points of largenesse, without to much for more years, &amp; shortnesse 
without to litle for lesse years, ar in this Elementarie to be speciallie 
considered. Bycause the Elementarie master is not commonlie the 
cunningest, and the Elementarie scholer is vnder twelue years. For a childe 
thus trained, shall learn the tung sooner, and do more betwene twelue and 
six: ene, then from seuen to seuentene if he begin without this traine. But 
the ortografie calls for me.

            <div xml:id="c1.12" type="chapter">
               <head>The method which the learned tungs vsed in the finding out of their own right writing.</head>
               <p>I Begin the Elementarie at the argument of right writing, because reading, 
which is the first Elementarie principle, must be directed both in precept 
and practis, thereafter as the thing, which is to be red, is writen or printed. 
And considering the right writing of our tung is yet in question: som, but 
those to forward, esteming it quite vnproper: som, but those to bakward, 
thinking it perfit enough: som, &amp; those the soundest iudging it to be in 
most well appointed, tho in particulars to be <pb n="62"/>
helpt: is it not a verie necessarie labor to set the writing certain, that the 
reading maie be sure? Now in examining the right of our writing, I begin at 
that method, which the learned tungs vsed, to find out the like right in their 
own writing, when it was in like question, that ours now is, for these two 
reasons. First by following their president, and marking that course, which 
was vsed in them, I shall both haue good warrant against anie such, as shall 
mislike of my currant, and dream of new deuises: and withall, I shall be 
abler to work the like in English, by vsing the like precept, in the like 
obseruation. For all tungs kepe one, and the same rule for their man, tho 
euerie one haue his propertie in part, which particular propertie, as it is 
noted in the best tungs, (which ar so termed, bycause they are so estemed, 
for the prerogatiue of that vse, which we find to be in them) so it is 
warranted in ours, euen by president from them. So that hereby I shall not 
seme, I hope, to anie aduised reader, but to haue vsed a verie good mean, for 
the finding out of that, which is to be decided in the right of our writing: 
and if anie other, either of peuishnesse, or of ignorance, shall mislike my 
proceding, the honor of my president, being rightlie followed, (which I hope 
to perform) will both defend me, and condemn them, if it cannot content 
them. The second cause, that moued me to begin at this method, is thereby 
to answere all those obiections, which charge our writing with either 
insufficiencie, or confusion: and also to examin by it, as by a sure 
tuchstone, all the other supplements, which haue bene deuised heretofore, to 
help our writing, by either altering of the old characts, or deuising of som 
new, or encreasing of their number. For if the other so estemed tungs, when 
theie were subiect to, and charged with these same supposed wants, 
wherewith our writing is now burdened, did deliuer them selues by other 
means, then either by altering, or by innouating, or by encreasing their 
characts, and made the stuf of their own custom, to be stear of their 
direction, as this method will shew, why should we desire to seke foren 
means, and impertinent to our tung, by deuise of new forge, hauing such a 
pattern to perfit our writing, by a so well warranted president? That the 
finest tung, was once in filth, the verie course of natur proceding <pb n="63"/>
from weaknesse, to strength from imperfection to perfitnesse, from 
a mean degre, to a main dignitie, doth giue vs to behold, yea tho neither 
<hi>Marcus Varro</hi>, not yet <hi>Quintilian</hi>, nor anie such as 
<hi>Priscian</hi> did shew the like in the Latin, and by example in that one, 
confirmed the like in all: which I will not rip vp, as a thing of moe vaunt for 
reading, then of help to writing, where one generall reason, proued by one 
aprticular, of perpetuall sequele, like a geometricall demonstration, will 
serue well enough. 


</p>
               <p>Well then, what means did those languages vse, which haue won the opinion, 
that theie be right write, to com by that right, which wrought that opinion? 
There be two considerations in speche, concerning the waie, which hath bene 
vsed in the fining thereof. For if we look into the first degre of fining, 
before which, no tung at all had anie beawtie in the pen, we ar to consider, 
how the verie first tung did procede from hir first rudenesse, to hir best 
perfection: Again if we look into the next degre, wherein the like finenesse 
ensewed in other tungs, by following the like course to that which the first 
refiners took, then we ar to consider, how other secondarie languages haue 
proined and pikt them selues, by following that method, which the primitiue 
did vse. 


</p>
               <p>But bycause I desire to be warranted by them both, that is, both following 
the first finers, &amp; the second presidentiaries, in this my course, (which 
no man hath yet kept in this argument, as I can perceice, tho diuerse write 
ortografies,) and my opinion is, that it best besemes a scholer, to procede 
by Art in anie recouerie, from the clawes if ignorance: Therefor I wil rip vp, 
euen from the verie root, how and by what degrees, the verie first tung, doth 
seme to com by that her perfection in writing, &amp; what order was taken 
to continew that perfection, euer sence the time that anie tung is perfited. 
Allwaies reseruing so much to his consideration, which entendeth the fining 
of anie speche, as concerneth the propertie of anie particular tung, which 
particularitie will not be comprised vnder generall precept with anie other 
tung, but must be directed by priuat obseruation, and particular exception <pb n="64"/>
against the common rule. And yet euen this so particular a circumstance is 
not omitted in the generall method of the first fining, and thereby it is 
commended vnto vs by waie of translation, which com in the third degre, and 
fine after the first, by following of the midle. Now in this long waie from 
the first soilth of extreme rudenesse, to the last neatnesse of most cunning, 
I will apoint thre rests, euerie one naturallie succeding the other, where the 
readers conceit maie light &amp; go on foot, if it be wearied with riding, I 
do not saie with reading. The first is, while the sound alone bare the swaie 
in writing. The second is, while consent in vse did transport the autoritie, 
from sound alone, to <hi>reason, custom</hi>, and <hi>sound</hi> ioyntlie. The 
third, which presentlie raigneth, is, while that <hi>reason &amp; custom</hi>, 
do assure their own ioynt gouernment with <hi>sound</hi>, by the mean of Art. 
For <hi>sound</hi> like a restrained not banished <hi>Tarquinius</hi> desiring to 
be restored to his first and sole monarchie, and finding som, but no more 
then sounding fauorers, did seke to make a tumult in the scriueners 
prouince, euer after that, <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> were ioyned with 
him in commission. 


</p>
               <p>I will therefor first deal with that regiment in writing, which was vnder 
sound, when euerie thing was writen according to the sound, tho that kind of 
gouernment be long ago worn out. 


</p>
               <p>I should begin to high in seking out the ground of right writing, (as he that 
fetcht the batle of <hi>Troie</hi> from <hi>Ledæs</hi> two egs, or as she that 
was angrie with felling the first tre, bycause she took vnkindnesse with him 
that came by ship, to that place where she did dwell). If I should make 
enquirie either who deuised letters first, or who wrote first, a thing as 
vncertain to be known, as fruteles if it were known. For <hi>Herodotus</hi> in 
his <hi>Muses, Diodorus</hi>, in his librarie, <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his preparatiue, 
<hi>Plinie</hi> in his historie, <hi>Flauius Iosephus</hi> in his antiquities of 
<hi>Rome, Coelius Rhodiginus</hi>, in his antiquitie of reading, <hi>Polydorus 
Virgilius</hi> in his inuentors of things, and manie seuerall writers mo, 
seking to learn out either the first founder of the generall charact, or the 
first deuisor of the particular, for particular nations, ar as new to seke, 
when they haue sought all, as theie were at first, before theie sought anie. 
For what certaintie <pb n="65"/>
can there be had of so old a thing? or what profit can rise by som one mans 
name, if one were the founder, as it cannot be. Who tho he be honored for 
the frute of his inuention, yet doth his autoritie small good, wher the 
matter in question is to be confirmed, not by the inuentors credit, who 
dwells we known not where, but by the vsers profit, which euerie one feles. 
And therefor as theie, whosoeuer deuised the thing first (for it was no one 
mans inuention, nor of anie one age) did a maruellous good turn to all their 
posteritie: so we, which be their posteritie, ar to think well of the 
inuentors, and to iudge thus of their inuentions: that verie necessitie was 
the foundresse of letters, and of all writing, as it hath bene onelie the 
generall breder of all such things, as our life is better by, when nede and 
want enforced mens wits, to seke for such helps. For the tung conueying 
speche no further then to those, which were within hearing, and the 
necessitie of conueiance oftimes falling out betwene som persons that were 
further of: a deuice was made to serue the eie a far of, by the mean of 
letters, as natur did satisfie the ear at hand by benefit of speche. For the 
deliuerie of learning by the pen to posteritie, was not the first cause that 
found out letters, but an excellent vse perceiued to be in them to serue for 
perpetuitie, a great while after theie had bene found by necessitie. The 
letter being thus found out, to serue a nedefull turn took the force of 
expressing euerie distince <hi>sound</hi> in voice, not by them selues or anie 
vertew in their form (for what likenesse or what affinitie hath the form of 
anie letter in his own natur, to answer the force or sound in mans voice?) 
but onelie by consent of those men, which first inuented them, and the 
pretie vse therof perceaued by those, which first did receiue them. Whereby 
the peple that vsed them first, agreed with those, that found them first, 
such a sound in the voice should be resembled by such a signe to the eie: and 
that such a signe in the eie should be so returned to the ear, as the 
aspectable figur of such an audible <hi>sound</hi>: whereunto theie 
subscribed their names, and set to their seals the daie and year, when their 
consent past. 


</p>
               <p>Herevpon in the first writing, the <hi>sound</hi> alone did lead the pen, and 
euerie word was writen with those letters, which the <pb n="66"/>
                  <hi>sound</hi> did commaund, bycause the letters were inuented, to expresse 
sounds. Then for the right in writing, who was souerain and iudge, and but 
<hi>sound</hi> alone? who gaue sentence of pen, ink, and paper, but 
<hi>sound</hi> alone? then what was found in the setting down, but that 
which was awarded by <hi>sound</hi> alone? Then euerie one of the peple, 
then euerie one tho most vnskilfull, was partaker in autoritie, &amp; 
<hi>sound</hi> should rule alone, &amp; all those haue a stroke, in the 
gouernment of <hi>sound</hi>, whosoeuer were able but euen to make a sound. 
You deuised all this to expresse me, why should not I then iudge, when I 
were expressed, seing, you your self told me, that such a litle note in sight, 
was to resemble such a thing in <hi>sound</hi>? In those daies, all those 
arguments, which cleaue so sore vnto the prerogatiue of <hi>sound</hi>, &amp; 
plead so for his interest, in setting down of letters, were most estemed of, 
as most agreable to the time, &amp; most officious to the state. But 
afterward when <hi>sound</hi> vpon great cause, was deposed from his 
monarchie, as no fit person to rule the pen alone, and had others ioyned with 
him in the same commission, of as good countenance as he, tho not to deall 
without him, then their credit was nothing so absolut, tho reasonable good 
still, as anie of <hi>sounds</hi> aduised fauorers, maie both well perceiue, and 
be well content with, if he will but mark the restraine of <hi>sounds</hi>
autoritie, &amp; the causes why, &amp; withall consider, that all opinions 
which concern his sole autoritie, &amp; tend to that end, as theie were of 
most account, while he was in that ruf, ar now but verie weak, when he is in 
the wain, &amp; ar to be qualified, according to that state, where 
<hi>sound</hi> is now ranged. For great inconueniences following, and the 
writing it self, prouing more false then trew, while the pen set down that 
form, which the ear did assure, to answer such a sound, &amp; the 
<hi>sound</hi> it self being to imperious, without anie either mercie or pitie, 
but death for disobedience, no pardon, no forgiuenesse, no misericordia, 
what equitie soeuer the contrarie side had: men of good wit, &amp; great 
vnderstanding, who perceaued &amp; misliked this imperiousnesse of 
<hi>sound</hi>, which yet was maintained, with great vncertaintie, naie rather 
with confusion, then anie assurance of right, assembled them selues 
together to common vpon so common a good, and in the end after resolut and <pb n="67"/>
ripe deliberation theie presented them selues before <hi>sound</hi>, vsing 
these, rather persuasions, then compulsions, to qualify his humor. 


</p>
               <p>That is wold please him, to take their speche in good part, considering it 
tuched not their priuat, but the generall good of the hole prouince of writing. 
That he wold call those reasons to his remembrance, which moued them at 
the first, to giue him alone the autoritie ouer the pen, as one whom theie 
then thought, to be most fit for such a gouernment, naie onelie most fit to 
gouern alone. That theie now perceiued, not anie defect in him, who vsed 
that like a prince, which was his peculiar, by their own commission: but an 
ouersight in them selues, who vnaduisedlie ouercharged him, with such an 
estate, as he could not weild alone, without his great dishonor, whereof 
theie were as tender, as of their own soules. That their request therefor 
vnto him, was, to praie &amp; beseche him, not to esteme more of his own 
priuat honor, then of the hole prouinces good. That theie might with his 
good leaue, amend their own error, which tho it concerned his person, yet 
should it not tuch his credit, the falt being their in their first choice. 


</p>
               <p>Theie paused a litle while, before theie vttered the verie main cause of this 
their motion, for that theie spyed <hi>sound</hi> to begin to change color, and 
half readie to swond. For the fellow is passionat, in autoritie tyrannous, in 
aw timorous. 


</p>
               <p>Howbeit seing the common good did vrge them to speche, theie went on, 
&amp; told him in plane terms, that he must be content to refer himself to 
order, and so much the rather, bycause their meaning was not to seke either 
his depriuation, or his resignation, but that it wold please him to qualify his 
gouernment, and to vse the assistence of a further councell, which theie 
ment to ioyn with him, a thing of great frute, &amp; of good example in 
manie such cases, where euen great potentates, and considerat princes, for 
the generall weall of their naturall states, (his being but voluntarie, and of 
their election) were verie well content, vpon humble sute made to them, to 
admit such a councell, and to vse them in affaires. That the reasons which 
moued them to make this sute, and might also moue him, to admit the same 
were of great importance: That bycause letters were first <pb n="68"/>
found onelie to expresse him, therefor theie had giuen him onelie and alone, 
the whole gouernment therein, and were well contented therewith, vntill 
such time, as theie had espied, not his misgouernment, but their own 
mischoice: that the bare &amp; primitiue inuentions, being but rude, and 
accordinglie rules, and experience now in time, growing to more finesse, 
why should theie not yeild to that in finesse, vpon better cause, wherevnto 
theie did yeild in rudenesse vpon mere nede? That no man hauing anie sense 
in the right of writing, which experience had commended, wold yeild the 
direction to sound alone, which altereth still, and is neuer like to it self, as 
either the partie pronouncer is of ignorance or knowledg: or the parties that 
pronounce, be of clear or stop deliuerie: or as the ear it self is of iudgement 
to discern. That considering these defects, which praie for reformance, and 
the letter it self, which desireth som assurance of her own vse, it might 
stand with his good pleasur, to admit to his counsell, two graue and great 
personages, which theie had long thought on, thorough whose assistence he 
might the better gouern the pen prouince. 


</p>
               <p>Bycause theie praised the parties so much, he desired their names. Theie 
answered <hi>Reason</hi>, to consider what wilbe most agreable vpon cause, 
and <hi>Custom</hi> to confirm that by experience and prouf, which reason 
should like best, and yet neither to do anie thing, without conference with 
sound. 


</p>
               <p>The personages pleased him for their own worthinesse, but the self same 
thing, which recommended them to him for their own valur, did fraie him to 
like them, for his own danger. For is not either <hi>reason</hi> or 
<hi>custom</hi>, if it please them to aspire, more like to rule the pen, then 
sound, said he to him self? Howbeit after that theie had charged his 
conscience, with all those reasons in one throng, which theie had vsed 
particularlie before, that it were no dishonor to yeild a litle vnto them, 
which had giuen him his hole rule: that it were no reason, but theie might 
haue leaue, to amend their own error, in ouercharging him, being their falt 
and his ease: That tho theie semed to empare his estate, yet theie did not 
seke to defraud him of his own: That the wrongs don to writing, which theie 
presented vnto him were matters worth redresse: That the counsellers, <pb n="69"/>
which theie appointed were honorable, and honest: that the common 
benefit of the hole writing prouince did earnestlie sew for it, wherevnto 
theie wer everie well assured, that so good a father, as he was, to that poor 
estate, wold neuer be vnwilling but rather voluntarilie condiscend, without 
anie request, as being half dishonored, in that he taried the request, but that 
he knew not of the greiues. After that theie had pressed him so near, tho he 
were verie loth, being once a sole monarch, to becom half priuate by 
admitting of controullers, as he thought, rather then counsellers, as theie 
ment, yet perceiuing that their power was such, as theie might enforce him 
to that, which theie praied him to graunt, if he should stand in terms with 
them, he was content to yeild, tho with som shew of miscontentment in his 
verie countenance, and to allow of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> as his 
fellow gouerners in the right of writing. 


</p>
               <p>For in verie dede concerning the autoritie of these mouers, wise and learned 
peple, what so euer theie lend ignorance to plaie with for a time, theie 
reserue to themselues both iudgement and autoritie, wherewith to controull, 
when theie se want of skill plaie the fooll to much, as in this same quarel 
for the alternation of sounds to presumptuous rule, theie had verie great 
reason. For as in faces, tho euerie man naturallie haue two eies, two ears, 
one nose, one mouth, and so furth, yet there is allwaie such diuersitie in 
countenances, as anie two men maie easilie be discerned, tho theie be as 
like as the <hi>Lacedæmonian</hi> princes, and brethern were, of whom 
<hi>Tullie</hi> speaketh: so likewise in the voice, tho in euerie one it passe 
thorough, by one mouth, one throte, one tung, one sense of tethe, and so 
furth, yet is it as different in euerie one, euen for giuing the sound, by 
reason of som diuersitie in the vocall instruments, as the faces be different 
in resembling like form, by som euident distinction, in the naturall purtrait. 
Which diuersitie tho it hinder not the deliuerie of euerie mans minde, yet is 
it to vncertain to rule euerie mans pen in setting down of letters. 


</p>
               <p>And again, what reason had it to follow euerie mans ear, as a master 
scriuener, and to leaue euerie mans pen to his own sound, where such 
difference was, as theie could not agre, when <pb n="70"/>
where the right was, euerie one clame to it? &amp; why not my ear best? 
Again why should ignorance in anie respect be taken for a gide in a case of 
knowledge? bycause of their voices? that were to popular, where the 
argument is singular. Bycause of their wills? that were to willfull, where 
wisdom should warrant. And therefor if anie multitude, tho of neuer so few, 
deserue to be followed, theie onelie were, which could both speak best, and 
giue best reason why. But that kinde of peple were to few at the first, to 
find anie place against a popular gouernment, where the ear led the ear, and 
why shall <hi>sound</hi> giue ouer his interest, seing letters were deuised to 
expresse sound in euerie one of vs, and not the conceit of these, and those 
few goodlie wise fellowes? And yet when corn was once in prouf, acorns 
grew out of place, tho a iollie mastie meat in a hoggish world. For 
naturallie the first serues the turn, till the finer and better do com in 
presence. And as somthing gat place worthilie of nothing, so must that 
somthing again, giue place to his better: As <hi>sound</hi> did somthing to 
expell rudenesse, tho it maie not bend it self, to kepe out finesse. 


</p>
               <p>Hereupon wise men wold standno longer to that duiersitie in writing, which 
necessarilie did follow, when euerie one did spell so, as the instruments of 
his voice did fashion his sound, or as his cunning gaue him, or as his ear 
could discern. All which means be full of varietie, and neuer one in all, as it 
doth appear by hole nations, which cannot sound som letters, that som other 
can, as the <hi>Ephramite </hi> in scriptur, which could not sound the first 
letter in <hi>Shibboleth </hi> being in hebrew the same chract with the first 
in <hi>Sibboleth </hi>: or as the witnesse in <hi>Tullie </hi>, which by propertie 
of his cuntrie, could not sound the first letter in <hi>Fundanius </hi>, against 
whom he cam. 


</p>
               <p>Vpon these miscontentments, and by consent of those, which could iudge, 
and vtter best, theie grew to a certian, and a reasonable <hi>custom</hi>, or 
else to saie truth, to a customarie <hi>reason</hi>, which theie held for a law, 
not vnaduisedle hit on, by error and time, but aduisedlie resolued on, by 
iudgement and skill. Neither yet, (which had ben contrarie to their promis) 
depriued theie <hi>sound</hi> of all his rialtie, which was dictatorlike, before, 
but theie ioyned <hi>reason</hi> with him, &amp; <hi>custom</hi> to, to begin 
then in <pb n="71"/>
right, and not in corruption after, as a <hi>Cæsar</hi> and a <hi>Pompeie</hi>, to 
be his colleges in a triumuirate. From that time forward <hi>sound</hi> could 
do much, but nothing so much, as he could do before, being verie manie 
times, verie iustlie ouerruled by his considerat companions, and fellowes in 
office. Thus ended the monarchie of <hi>sound</hi> alone. 


</p>
               <p>We ar now com to that regiment in writing, which was vnder <hi>sound, 
reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> ioyntlie togither, and proceded in this sort. 
<hi>Reason</hi> as he is in reason the principall director, of all best doings, 
and not writing alone, so he began to plaie the master, but wiselie withall, 
and with great modestie. For considering the disposition of his two 
companions, first of <hi>sound</hi>, which the letters were to expresse of 
dewtie, as therfor deuised: then of <hi>custom</hi>, which was to confirm, 
and make the waie to generall allowance, he established this for a generall 
law in the prouince of writing. That as the first founders, and deuisers of 
the letters, vsed their own libertie, in the assigning of such a charact in the 
eie, to such a sound in the voice, which assignation was mere voluntarie, 
&amp; of the founders choice: so it should be lawful for the said founders, 
and their posteritie, according as the necessitie of their vse, &amp; the 
dispatch in their pen did seme to require it, either to encrease the number 
of letters, if the insufficiencie in them did seme not to answer the varietie 
in <hi>sound</hi>, or to apply one and the same letter to diuerse vses, if it 
might be don with som pretie distinction, to auoid multitude of characts, as 
we apply words which be within number, to things which be without: &amp; 
generallie like naturall and chefe lord in a tenancie at mere will, to make 
their own nede the leuell of all letters, of all writing, of all speaking, to 
chop, to change, to alter, to transport, to enlarge, to lessen, to make, to 
mar, to begin, to end, to giue autoritie to this, to take it from that, as 
themselues should think good. This decre being penned by <hi>reason</hi>, 
both <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> did presentlie allow: <hi>sound</hi>
bycause there was no remedie, tho his hart longed still for his former 
Monarchie, which was now in th'Eclipse: <hi>Custom</hi>, bycause that did 
serue his turn best. For if necessarie vse, and dispatch in the pen, might 
haue autoritie, which was giuen them in law, by consent of those men, which 
were successors to them, who <pb n="72"/>
first founded the letter, which men were of the learneddest and wisest sort, 
then were <hi>Custom</hi> in dede, hauing <hi>reason</hi> to frind, &amp; 
<hi>sound</hi> no fo, a verie great prince in the hole prouince of both writing 
and speaking. And good reason why. For <hi>Custom</hi> is not that which 
men do or speak commonlie or most, vpon whatsoeuer occasion, but onelie 
that, which is grounded at the first, vpon the best and fittest reason, and is 
therefor to be vsed, bycause it is the fittest. Which if it take place 
according to the first appointment, then is <hi>custom</hi> in his right, if not, 
then abuse in dede doth seme to vsurp vpon <hi>custom</hi> in name. For in 
Lordships and maners is that custom, which the tenants do vse vpon their 
own surmise, or but that onelie, which the first Lord granted, vpon som 
speciall cause, and his posteritie confirms, vpon the like respect, either to 
their auncetor or to the thing? So that I take <hi>custom</hi> to bild vpon the 
cause, and not to make the cause. 


</p>
               <p>After that <hi>reason</hi> had brought both sound to this order, and 
<hi>custom</hi> to this autoritie, then was there nothing admitted in writing, 
but that onelie, which was subsigned by all their three hands. If the 
<hi>sound</hi> alone did serue, yet <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> must nedes 
confirm <hi>sound</hi>: if <hi>reason</hi> must take place, both <hi>sound</hi> and 
<hi>custom</hi> must nedes approue <hi>reason</hi>: if <hi>custom</hi> wold be 
credited, he might not passe, onelesse both <hi>sound</hi> did sooth him, 
&amp; <hi>reason</hi> did ratifie him. 


</p>
               <p>For the better continuance of this wise triumuirate, ech of the thre 
entertained such peple, as were fittest for their families. <hi>Sound</hi>, 
bycause he presumed onelie vpon his old autoritie not extinguished, tho 
restrained, and neded no great train now in that his restraint, he therefor 
contented himself with such of his old retinew, as knew his first 
commission, which was granted vnto him, when the deuise of letters cam 
first to light. Who still had an eie to sound, and set down that letter, which 
was appointed thereunto, onelesse reason and custom had put in a caueat, 
that in such a case the comission must be altered. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> again took into his seruice, <hi>obseruation</hi> and 
<hi>comparision: Obseruation</hi> to mark what were fairest in sense, what 
were readiest in pen, what were currantest in vse: <hi>Comparison</hi> to 
confer that, which he allowed in one, with that proportion, <pb n="73"/>
which he found in another, that the hole might be sutable. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Custom</hi> besides that he made verie much of both <hi>sound</hi> and 
<hi>reasons</hi> retinew, as his verie good frinds, whereby he was comended 
to generall practis, of himself &amp; for himself, he entertained 
<hi>warinesse</hi>, to be still like himself, and tho he altered vpon cause, as 
<hi>reason</hi> should enform him, yet to behaue himself so, as he might 
easilie be discerned from corruption in vse, which was his naturall enemie, 
and was alwaie bakt by the ignorant multitude, as <hi>custom</hi> it self was 
by those, that were of skill, both at his first planting, and thoroughout his 
performance. So had right <hi>sound</hi>, missounding to so, so had right 
reason, a slight shew of appearance to aduersarie, which still caried the 
weaker branes, but could neuer moue, either iudgement or cunning. 


</p>
               <p>During this compound gouernment of these thre, the matter of all our 
precepts, that belong to writing, did first grow to strength, then were rules 
grounded, then were exceptions laid, when <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi>
perceiued cause why. But none of all these were yet commended to Art, and 
set down in writing, but fleting in the memorie, and obseruation of writers, 
hauing sufficient matter to furnish an institution, and the bodie of an Art, 
tho not yet in method, which cam next in place, &amp; ioyned it self with 
the other thre vpon this occasion: 


</p>
               <p>All this time, while <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> gouerned the pen, as 
well as <hi>sound, sounds</hi> malcontented frinds did neuer rest but allwaie 
sought means to supplant the two other, euer buffing into the ignorant ears 
that of <hi>sounds</hi> autoritie, and his right to his own deliuerie: and the 
same errors, which troubled the pen, while <hi>sound</hi> alone was the 
setter down, began to crepe in again, and cause a new truble, in so much as 
all the ignoranter sort were clear of opinion that the verie sternesse of 
<hi>sound</hi> was onelie to be accepted without all exception, tho those of 
learning and wisdom, which had both first set vp <hi>reason</hi> and 
<hi>custom</hi>, as companions to <hi>sound</hi>, and still continewed in the 
same minde, could verie well discern vsurpation from enheritance, and right 
from wrong. 


</p>
               <p>Wherefor <hi>reason</hi> finding by this creping error both himself to be 
intuited by senslesse time, and his good <hi>custom</hi> to be <pb n="74"/>
sore assailed by counterfeat corruption, perceiued the falt to be for want of 
a good notarie, and a strong obligation, wherewith to set that in euerlasting 
autoritie, by right rule and trew writing, which he and <hi>custom</hi> both, 
by the consent of <hi>sound</hi>, had continewed in vse, tho not put down in 
writing, which wold euer be in danger of continuall reuolt, from the best to 
the worst, by the vncertaintie of time, and the eluishnesse of error, oneless 
it were set in writing, and the conditions subscribed by all their contents, 
for a perpetuall euidence against the repiner. For that is the difference, 
betwene a reasonable <hi>custom</hi> and an artificiall method, that the first 
doth the thing for the second to assure, and the second assureth, by 
obseruing of the first. 


</p>
               <p>While nothing was set down in writing, <hi>sound</hi> and his complices were 
in hope of som recouerie, hwich hope was cut of, when the writings were 
made, and the conditions set certain. The notarie to cut of all these 
controuersies, and to brede a perpetuall quietnesse in writing, was Art, 
which gathering al those roming rules, that <hi>custom</hi> had beaten out, 
into one bodie, disposed them so in writing, as euerie one knew his own 
limits, <hi>reason</hi> his, <hi>custom</hi> his, <hi>sound</hi> his. Now when 
<hi>reason, custom</hi> and <hi>sound</hi> were brought into order, and driuen 
to certaintie by the mean of Art, and artificiall method, then began the third 
the last and the best assurance in writing. 


</p>
               <p>Art being hirself in place perceiued the direction of anie hole tung to be 
verie infinite and hard, naie to be scant possible in generall, considering the 
diuerse properties that the thre rulers, <hi>reason, custom</hi>, and 
<hi>sound</hi> haue, which alter still with time. For what peple can be sure of 
his own tung anie long while? doth not speche alter somtime to the finer, if 
the state where it is vsed, continew it self, and grow to better countenance, 
for either great learning, or other dealing, which vse to proin a tung? And 
doth it not somtime change to the more corrupt, if the state where it is 
vsed, do chance to be ouerthrown, and a master tung comming in as 
conqueror, command both the peple, and the peples speche to? Vpon this 
consideration, what an infinit thing it were to chuse out such a subiect, as 
is so vncertain, Art took hirself to som one period in the <pb n="75"/>
tung, of most and best account, and therefor fittest to be made a pattern for 
others to follow, and pleasantest for hir self to trauell and toill in. Vpon 
which period she did bestow all those notes, which she did perceiue by 
obseruation (which is secretarie to <hi>reason</hi>) to be in the common vse 
of speche, and pen, either clear with <hi>sound</hi>, or sutable to 
<hi>reason</hi>, or liked in <hi>custom</hi>, but still bakt by them all. 


</p>
               <p>Such a period in the Greke tung was that time, when <hi>Demosthenes</hi>
liued, and that learned race of the father philosophers: such a period in the 
Latin tung, was that time, when <hi>Tullie</hi> liued, and those of that age: 
Such a period in the English tung I take this to be in our daies, for both the 
pen and the speche. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art</hi> chusing such a period in the primitiue tung, and hauing all the 
stuf gathered into notes, wherewith to set vp hir hole frame, and bilding of 
method, distributed them so, as there was not anie one thing necessarie for 
right writing, but she had it in writing, sauing som particulars, which will 
be still vnrulie, and make fresh matter for an other period in speche: tho 
that, which is now made so artificiall and sure, com neuer in danger of anie 
alteration, but be still held for a president to others, as most perfit in it 
self. For a tung once enrolled by the benefit of Art, and grown to good 
credit, is thereby first setled it self in such assurance, as the right thereof 
cannot be denied, the contrarie to right wold be soon espied, howsoeuer it 
wrangle: then is it made a common example to other languages, which haue 
stuf for such a method, and desire to be fined, whereby to fine them. 


</p>
               <p>This course kept the first tung that euer was fined, from the first inuention 
of anie letter, which was least in act, but greatest in power, vntill 
corruption slilie goten in, but wiselie perceiued did cause a reformation. 
Which reformation grew again to corruption in natur of a relapse, bycause 
tho it were soundlie made, yet was it not well armed with sufficient 
suretie against the festuring euill of error &amp; corruption. Wherefor 
when it felt the want of such an assurance, it praied aid of Art, which like a 
beaten lawyer, handled the matter so, and <pb n="76"/>
with such a forecast in the penning of his books, as euerie of them, which 
had anie interest were taught to know what was their own. Other tungs 
beside the first refined, marking this currant applied the same to their own 
seuerall writing, and were verie glad with great thanks, to vse the benefit 
of those mens labor, which wrastled with the difficulties, of <hi>sound, 
error, corruption</hi>, and the residew of that ill humored peple. 


</p>
               <p>This originall president in the first, and translated patern in the rest, I 
mean to follow in the finding out of our right English writing, which 
whether it will proue to be fashioned accordinglie, and framed like the 
patern, it shall then appear when the thing it self, shall com furth in hir 
own naturall hew, tho in artificiall habit. 


</p>
               <p>I haue not vsed anie autors name in this discourse either to confirm, or to 
confute by credit of autoritie. For anie man allmost of anie mean learning, 
maie quiklie espy, that these matters ar not without autors. For can 
<hi>reason, custom, art, sound, error, corruption</hi>, and such other qualities, 
as plaie their parts in this so ordinate a plat, lak testimonie of writers 
being so much writen of? But I did onelie seke to satisfie nede and to polish 
no further. To conclude and knit vp the argument, this method and this order 
vsed the first tung, that euer was brought to anie right in writing, by the 
help whereof vnder the direction of Art, all those tungs which we now call 
learned, ar com to that certaintie, which we se them now in, thorough 
precept and rule. The same help will I vse in my particular method. 


</p>
               <p>Which before I deall with, I must exmain two principall points in our tung 
whereof one is, whether our tung haue stuf in it for art to bild on, bycause I 
said, that Art delt where she found matter, sufficient for hir trauell. The 
other is, whether our writing be iustlie chalenged for those infirmities 
wherewith it is charged, in this our time, bycause I said that this period in 
our time, semeth to be the perfitest period in our English tung, &amp; that 
our custom hath alredie beaten out his own rules redie for the method, 
&amp; frame of Art. Which two points ar necessarilie to be considered. For 
if there be either no matter for Art in extreme confusion: or if our custom 
be not yet ripe to be reduced vnto rule, then that perfit period in our tung is 
not yet <pb n="77"/>
com, &amp; I haue set vpon this argument, while it is yet to grene. Howbeit, 
I hope it will not proue to timelie, and therefor I will first shew, that there 
is in our tung great and sufficient stuf for Art: then that there is not such 
infirmitie in our writing, as is pretended, but that our custom is grown fit 
to receaue this artificiall frame, and that by this method, which I haue laid 
down, without anie foren help, and with those rules onelie, which ar, and 
maie be gathered out of our own ordinarie writing. 

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="c1.13" type="chapter">
               <head>That the English tung hath in it self sufficient matter to work her own artificiall direction, for the right writing thereof.</head>
               <p>IT must nedes be that our English tung hath matter enough in hir own 
writing, which maie direct her own right, if it be reduced to certain 
precept, and rule of Art, tho it haue not as yet bene thoroughlie perceaued. 


</p>
               <p>The causes why it hath not yet bene thoroughlie perceaued, ar the hope 
&amp; despare of such, as haue either thought vpon it, and not dealt in it, or 
that haue delt in it, but not rightlie thought vpon it. 


</p>
               <p>For som considering the great difficultie, which theie found to be in the 
writing thereof, euerie letter almost being deputed to manie, and seuerall, 
naie to manie and wellnigh contrarie sounds and vses, euerie word almost 
either wanting letters, for his necessarie sound, or hauing some more then 
necessitie requireth, began to despare in the midst of such a confusion, euer 
to find out anie sure direction, whereon to ground Art, and to set it certain. 
And what if either theie did not seke, or did not know how to seke, in right 
form of Art, and the composing method? But whether difficultie in the 
thing, or infirmitie in the searchers, gaue caue thereunto, the parties them 
selues gaue ouer the thing as in a desperat case, and by not medling thorough 
despare, theie helped not the right. 


</p>
               <p>Again som others bearing a good affection to their naturall tung, and 
resolued to burst thorough the midst of all these difficulties, which offered 
such resistence, as theie misliked <pb n="78"/>
the confusion, wherewith the other were afraid, so theie deuised a new 
mean, wherein theie laid their hope, to bring the thing about. Wherevpon 
som of them being of great place and good learning, set furth in print 
particular treatises of that argument, with these their new coneaued means, 
how we ought to write, and so to write right. But their good hope by reason 
of their strange mena, had the same euent, that the others despare had, by 
their either misconceauing the thing at first, or their diffidence at the last. 
Wherein the parties themselues not dout deserue some praise, and thanks to, 
of vs and our cuntrie in both these extremities of hope and despare, tho 
theie helped not the thing, which theie went about, but in common 
apparence, did somwhat hinder it rather. For both he, that despared in the 
end, took great pains, before diffidence caused him giue ouer to despare: 
and he that did hope by his own desuise to suply the generall want, was not 
verie idle both in brain, to deuise, and in hand to deliuer the thing, which he 
deuised. Which their trauell in the thing, which he deuised. Which their 
trauell in the thing, and desire to do good, deserue great thanks, tho that 
waie which theie took, did not take effect. 


</p>
               <p>The causes why theie took not effect, and thereby in part did hinder the 
thing, by making of manie think the case more desperat then it was in dede, 
bycause such fellowes did so faill, were these. Their despare, which 
thought, that the tung was vncapable of anie direction, came of a wrong 
cause, the falt rising in dede not of the thing, which theie did condemn, as 
altogether rude and vnrulie, but of the parties them selues, who mistook 
their waie. For the thing it self will soon be ordered (our custom is grown 
so orderable) tho it require som diligence, and good consideration, in him 
that must find it out. But when a writer taketh a wrong principle, quite 
contrarie to common practis, where triall must be tuch, and practis must 
confirm the mean, which he conceaueth, is it anie maruell if the vse of a 
tung ouerthwart such a mean, which is not conformable vnto it? Herevpon 
proceded the despare to hit right, bycause theie missed of their minde, 
whereas in dede theie should haue changed their minde, to haue hit vpon that 
right, which as it is in the thing, so will it soon be found out, if it be 
rightlie <pb n="79"/>
sought for. 


</p>
               <p>Again the others hope deceiued them to as much. For theie considered not, 
that whereas common reason, and common custom haue bene long dealers in 
seking out of their own currant, themselues wilbe councellers, and will 
neuer yeild to anie priuat conceit, which shall seme euidentlie either to 
force them or to crosse them, as theie themselues do, neuer giuing anie 
precept, how to write right, till theie haue rated at custom, as a most 
pernicious enemie to truth and right, euen in that thing, where custom hath 
most right, if it haue right in anie. Wherefor when theie proceded on in a 
customarie argument, with the enmitie of him, which is Lord of the soill, 
was it anie wonder if theie failed of their purpos, &amp; hindered the 
finding out of our right writing, which must nedes be compased by customs 
consent, and reasons frindship? So in the mean time, while despare 
deceiues the one, and hope begiles the other, the one missing his waie, the 
other making a fo, and both going astraie, theie both lease their labor, and 
let the finding out of our right in writing, by their ill led, and worse laid 
labor, bycause the artificiall course, in finding out such a thing, hath 
another currant, as I haue shewed before in the last title. 


</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding all this, it is verie manifest, that the tung it self hath 
matter enough in it self, to furnish out an art, &amp; that the same mean, 
which hath bene vsed in the reducing of other tungs to their right, will serue 
this of ours, both for generalitie of precept, and certaintie of ground, as 
maie be easile proued by these four arguments, the antiquitie of our tung, 
the peples with, their learning, and their experience. For how can it be, but 
that a tung, which hath continewed manie hundred years, not onelie a tung, 
but one of good account, both in speche, and pen, hath growen in all that 
time to som finesse, and assurance of it self, by so long and so generall an 
vse, tho it be not as yet founded, the peple that haue vsed it, being none of 
the dullest, and trauelling continuallie in all exercises that concern 
learning, in all practises that procure experience, either in peace or war, 
either in publike, or priuat, either at home or abrode? 


</p>
               <p>As for the antiquitie of our speche, whether it be measured <pb n="80"/>
by the ancient <hi>Almane</hi>, whence it cummeth originallie, or euen but by 
the latest terms which it boroweth daielie from foren tungs, either of pure 
necessitie in new matters, or of mere brauerie, to garnish it self withall, it 
cannot be young. Onelesse the <hi>Germane</hi> himself be young, which 
claimeth a prerogatiue for the age of his speche, of an infinit prescription: 
Onelesse the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greke</hi> be young, whose words we 
enfranchise to our own vse, tho not allwaie immediatlie from them selues, 
but mostwhat thorough the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi>: 
Onelesse other tungs, which be neither <hi>Greke</hi> nor <hi>Latin</hi>, nor 
anie of the forenamed, from whom we haue somwhat, as theie haue from 
ours, will for companie sake be content to be young, that ours maie not be 
old. But I am well assured, that euerie one of these, will striue for 
antiquitie, and rather grant it to vs, then forgo it themselues. So that if the 
verie newest words, which we vse do sauor of great antiquitie, and the 
ground of our speche be most ancient, it must nedes then folow, that our 
hole tung was weined long ago, as hauing all her tethe. 


</p>
               <p>For the account of our tung, both in pen and speche, no man will dout 
thereof, who is able to iudge what those thinges be, which make anie tung to 
be of account, which things I take to be thre, the autoritie of the peple 
which speak it, the matter &amp; argument, wherein the speche dealeth, the 
manifold vse, for which the speche serueth. For all which thre, our tung 
nedeth not to giue place, to anie of her peres. 


</p>
               <p>First to saie somwhat for the peple, that vse the tung, the <hi>English</hi>
nation hath allwaie bene of good credit, and great estimation, euer since 
credit and estimation by historie came on this side the <hi>Alps</hi>, which 
appeareth to be trew, euen by foren cronicles (not to vse our own in a case 
of our own) which would neuer haue said so much of the peple, if it had bene 
obscure, and not for an historie, or not but well worthie of a perpetuall 
historie. 


</p>
               <p>Next, for the argument, wherein it dealeth, whether priuat or publik, it maie 
compare with som other, that think verie well of their own selues. For not 
to tuch ordinarie affairs in comon life, will matters of learning in anie kind 
of argument, make a tung of account? Our nation then, I think, will hardlie 
be proued <pb n="81"/>
to haue bene vnlearned at anie time, in anie kinde of learning, not to vse 
anie bigger speche. Wherefor hauing learning by confession of all men, 
&amp; vttering that learning in their own tung, for their own vse, of verie 
pure necessitie (bycause we learn to vse, and the vse is in our own) theie 
could not but enrich the tung, and puchase it account. 


</p>
               <p>Will matters of war, whether ciuill or foren, make a tung of account? Our 
neighbor nations will not deny, our peple to be verie warrious, and our own 
cuntrie will confesse it, tho loth to fele it, both remembring the smart, 
&amp; comparing with som other, neither to vaunt our selues, nor to gall our 
frinds, with anie mo words. 


</p>
               <p>Now in offring matter to speche, war is such a breder, as tho it be opposit 
to learning, bycause it is enemie to the Muses, yet it dare compare with anie 
point in learning, for multitude of discourses, tho not commonlie so certain, 
ne yet of so good vse, as learned arguments be. For war (besides all graue 
and sad considerations about it, which be manie and wise) as somtime it 
sendeth vs trew reports, either priuatelie in proiects and deuises, that be 
entended, or publikelie in euents, which be blased abrode, bycause theie be 
don, so mostwhat it giueth out infinit and extreme, I dare not saie lies, but 
verie incredible newes, bycause it maie hatch them at will, being in no 
danger of controllment, and comonlie in such practises and places, as haue 
not manie witnesses, while eurie man seketh aswell to saue him self, as to 
harm his enemie, besides som curteous entertainment, which a deuising 
referendarie hath euen by telling that, which is not trew, to such as loue to 
hear, and either like or will like. All which occasions, and infinit mo, about 
stratagemes, &amp; engins, giue matter to speche, and cause of new words, 
and by making it so redie, do make it of renoun. 


</p>
               <p>Will all kindes of trade, and all sorts of traffik, make a tung of account? If 
the spreading sea, and the spacious land could vse anie speche, theie would 
both shew you, where, and in how manie strange places, theie haue sene our 
peple, and also giue you to wit, that theie deall in as much, and as great 
varietie of matters, as anie other peple do, whether at home or abrode. 
Which is the reason why our tung doth serue so manie vses, <pb n="82"/>
bycause it is conuersant with so manie peple, and so well acquainted with 
so manie matters, in so sundrie kindes of dealing. Now all this varietie of 
matter, and diuersitie of trade, make both matter for our speche, &amp; 
mean to enlarge it. For he that is so practised, will vtter that, which he 
practiseth in his naturall tung, and if the strangenesse of the matter do so 
require, he that is to vtter, rather then he will stik in his vtterance, will 
vse the foren term, by waie of premunition, that the cuntrie peple do call it 
so, and by that mean make a foren word, an English denison. 


</p>
               <p>All which reasons concerning but the tung, and the account thereof, being 
put together, as of themselues, theie proue the nations exercise in learning, 
and their practis in other dealings: so theie seme to infer no base witted 
peple, not to amplify it with more, bycause it is not for foulls to be so well 
learned, to be so warrious, to be so well practised. I shall not nede to proue 
anie of these my positions, either by foren or home historie: seing my 
reader stranger, will not striue with me for them, and mine own nation, will 
not gainsaie me in them, I think, which knoweth them to be trew, and maie 
vse them for their honor. 


</p>
               <p>Wherefor I maie well conclude my first position: that if <hi>vse</hi> and 
<hi>custom</hi> hauing the help of so long time, and continuance, wherein to 
fine our tung: of so great learning and experience, which furnish matter for 
the fining: of so good wits and iudgements, which can tell how to fine, haue 
griped at nothing in all that time with all that cunning, by all those wits, 
which theie will not let go, but hold for most certaine, in the right of our 
writing: that then our tung hath no certaintie to trust to , but writeth all at 
randon. But the antecedent in my opinion, is alltogether vnpossible, 
wherefor the consequent, is a great deall more then probable, which is, that 
our tung hath in hir own possession, and writing verie good euidence to 
proue hir own right writing: Which tho no man as yet, by anie publik writing 
of his, semeth to haue sene, yet the tung it self is redie to shew them, to 
anie whosoeuer, which is able to read them, and withall to iudge, what 
euidence is right in the right of writing. Wherefor seing I haue proued 
sufficientlie <pb n="83"/>
in mine own opinion, that there is great cause, why our tung should 
haue som good right, in her own writing, and take my self to haue had the 
sight of that euidence, whereby that same right appeareth most iustifiable, 
and am not alltogither ignorant, how to giue sentence thereof, I will do my 
best, according to that course, which I said was kept in the first, and 
generall fining of anie speche, which also hath bene translated to euerie 
secondarie, and particular tung, to set furth som certaintie for the English 
writing, by those notes, which I haue obserued in the tung it self, the pure 
best and finest therein, offering mean by comparison with them selues, both 
to correct, and to direct the worse and more grosse, without either 
innouating anie thing, as theie do, which set furth new deuises, or by 
mistaking my waie, as theie do, which despare, that our tung can be brought 
to anie certaintie, without som maruellous foren help. Thus much for the 
artificiall stuf in our tung, now to the obiections which charge it with 
infirmities. 

</p>

            <div xml:id="c1.14" type="chapter">
               <head>An answer to som pretended imperfections in the writing of our tung.</head>
               <p>THis title tho it seme by the inscription to pretend som offence, yet is it 
nothing moodie at all, bycause it entendeth no defense, as against an 
enemie, but a conference, as with a frind. For those men, with whom I haue 
to deall therein, do wish their naturall tung, as well as I do, theie desire to 
se it right writen, no lesse then I do. Theie haue as good shew of iust 
enemitie to error, and corruption, as I haue assurance of right direction. 
And therefor I will rather endeuor my self to perswade them as frinds, then 
to confute them as foes, rather to ioyn with them in som points, then to 
defy them in all. 


</p>
               <p>In the hole matter of this conference with them, theie either blame certain 
errors, which theie pretend to be in our writing: or else theie will seme to 
seke the reforming thereof. In the blame of errors, theie rate at 
<hi>custom</hi> as a vile corrupter, <pb n="83"/>
and complain of our letters, as to miserable few. In their desire of 
redresse, theie appeall to <hi>sound</hi>, as the onelie souerain, and surest 
leader in the gouernment of writing: &amp; fly to <hi>innouation</hi>, as the 
onelie mean, to reform all errors, that be in our writing. Which their 
particular branching, I will follow in my reply, and yet in no reply, but 
excuse, for the innocencie of our pen, where it is without falt, tho it be not 
without blame and in my plaine confession of som manifest error, where 
there is cause why. 


</p>
               <p>In their quarrell to <hi>custom</hi> theie seke first to bring it into generall 
hatred, as a common corrupter of all good things, and that naturallie, 
without anie exception, and therefor no maruell if it abuse speche, which as 
it passeth thorough euerie mans mouth, and is resembled by euerie mans 
pen, so must it nedes gather much corruption by the waie, bycause manie and 
ill be all one in dede, tho deuided in term, as good and few, tho different in 
name, yet be the same in pith: And common corruption, which theie terme 
<hi>Custom</hi>, is an ill director to find out a right. Herevpon theie conclude, 
that as it semeth most probable, so it is most trew, that the chefe errors, 
which ar crept into our pen, do take their beginning at the onelie infection 
of a naughtie <hi>custom</hi>. Which bycause it is naught, therefor ought it 
not so much as once to be named, in the direction to a right, in either pen or 
speche, being so manifest a falsarie, notwithstanding whatsoeuer anie 
either old or new writers can pretend to the contrarie, for either defense or 
excuse thereof. Then theie descend two particularities, wherein theie proue 
that customarilie, we do somtime burden our words to much, with to manie 
letters, somtimes we pinch them to near with to few, somtimes we 
misshape them with wrong sounding, somtime we misorder them, with 
wrong placing. And be not these maruellous great causes of miscontentment 
with <hi>Custom</hi>, which is the breder of them? Besides all these which 
ar but points of penning onelie, to aggrauate the discredit wherewith theie 
charge <hi>custom</hi>, theie seke to make it odious, as an enemie to vertew, 
euen abusing what is best. And will there anie that fauoreth vertew, 
protect <hi>Custom</hi>, being such a venim to all vertews, and such <pb n="85"/>
a poison to all vertewous effects? Or can there anie that frindeth his 
cuntrie conceiue well of that, which corrupteth hir pen, and poisoneth hir 
speche? Sure not I. For neither wold I haue vertew to hold me for hir 
enemie, by defending of hir fo, nor yet my cuntrie to froun at me for 
fauoring hir corrupters. Certainlie that <hi>custom</hi> is most vile, which 
doth but speak ill of good things: but to seke their corruption is a most 
villanous part. And to abuse speche in anie hir deliuerie whether by tung or 
pen, the good benefit whereof, doth serue most of our nedes, as vertew doth 
the best, is extreme beastlie. And therefor assuredlie, as those my good 
cuntrimen, haue most iust cause to be angrie with these corruptions: so 
might theie as iustlie turn their anger vpon me, if I should anie waie but so 
much as seme to excuse or but to extenuate so pernicious a fact. Neither 
can anie writer, new or old, but hasard his own credit, if he do but seme to 
shew anie incling of fauor that waie. 


</p>
               <p>And yet if good writers seme to fauor <hi>custom</hi>, then the case is not so 
clear, as you take it to be, that there is nothing in <hi>custom</hi>, but an hell 
of most vile, and filthie corruptions: that it alone infecteth all good things: 
that it alone corrupteth right writing. For if it were in dede and onelie so, 
theie wold not warrant it, as (now I remember my self) theie praise it verie 
often, and giue it great credit. Is there then not som error in the name, 
&amp; maie not <hi>custom</hi> be misconstrewed? for sure the writers, 
when theie speak of <hi>custom</hi>, theie mean that rule in doing, and 
vertewous life, wherein good men agre and their consent is that, which 
these men term <hi>custom</hi> therein: as theie call that rule in speaking 
and writing the <hi>custom</hi> thereof, wherein the skilfull and best learned 
do agre. And is it likelie that either the honest in dede will mislead vertew 
in liuing, or the learned in dede will mislike right in writing? And again, 
those honest men, which allow of <hi>custom</hi> in matters of life, complain 
verie much of corruption in manners, and naughtie behauior: and the learned 
men, which allow of <hi>custom</hi> in matters of speche and pen, do 
complain verie much of error in writing, and corruption in speche: and both 
the two, accuse the most peple as the leaders to error, and the common 
abuse, as the frute of a multitude. And <pb n="86"/>
therefor it cannot otherwise be, but that the duble name is that, which 
deceiues. For theie, which accuse <hi>custom</hi> do mean false error, which 
counterfeateth <hi>custom</hi>, and the ignorant for rashnesse, and yet 
directeth all the most. And theie that praise <hi>custom</hi> do mean plain 
truth, which cannot dissemble, which is companion with the honest in 
vertew, and with the learned in cunning, and directeth all the best. And will 
ye se? This mistermed <hi>custom</hi> in the pen, is that counterfeat abuse, 
which was the onelie cause, why <hi>sounds</hi> monarchie, whereof I spake 
before, was so dissolued, and was it self condemned, by those wise peple, 
which ioyned <hi>reason</hi> with <hi>sound</hi>: and the right <hi>custom</hi>
which writers commend so, is that companion of <hi>reason</hi>, which 
succeeded in place, when the counterfeat was cast out. Now ye se the error. 
So neither writers do allow of such a corruption, neither is <hi>custom</hi>
your contrarie, but both writers, and <hi>custom</hi>, both you, and I will 
scratch out the eies of common error, for misusing of good things, and 
belying of <hi>custom</hi>. If good things be abused it is by ill peple, whose 
misnsmed <hi>custom</hi> is right named error, and well blamed lewdnesse. 
If words be ouercharged with number of letters, that coms either by 
couetousnesse in such, as fell them by lines, or by ignorance in such, as 
besides the pestering them with to manie, do both weaken them with to few, 
and wrong them with the change, both of force and place, whose error as I 
mone, so I will seke to amend it, and while I amend it, I will confute by 
correcting, and heall by comparing, that euerie one beholding the redresse, 
where he finds the falt, maie be able to iudge both of right, and wrong, by 
conferring of contraries. Thus I take it my good cuntrimen, that you be 
deceiued in the name, and blame one for another. For <hi>custom</hi>
certainlie in a matter of speche, is a great and a naturall gouernour, tho in 
other things it maie somtimes seme to be a sore vsurper. And yet good 
autors will hardlie graunt that, which still fre <hi>custom</hi> from all 
offensiue note, both in words and dedes, bycause theie ground <hi>custom</hi>
not upon error in deprauation at the last: but vpon iudgement, in direction 
from the first. And theie which entreat <hi>custom</hi> so hardlie, entertain 
it so, vnder an vnproper name, as vnworthie to be heard speak <pb n="87"/>
in the right of writing, seing it semes to be the onelie occasion of all 
corruption therein, as theie surmise, taking <hi>custom</hi> to be grounded 
vpon the common confusion in practis of the most, and least iudiciall peple, 
which is mother to all wrong opinions, concerning anie iudgement of right. 
Wherein theie neither mark that the ignorant multitude is not held for 
mistresse, of that right and reasonable <hi>custom</hi>, which is the naturall 
<hi>custom</hi>, and which theie of the contrarie side do follow, as the best 
gide in right writing: neither yet consider theie, that their aduersaries, 
whom theie oppugn so, do confesse som errors in the ordinarie penning, 
proceding of that corruption, which theie wrongfullie term <hi>custom</hi>, 
which errors theie also seke to haue cut of, as the idle clogging of words 
with nedelesse letters, and such other ordinarie errors, which rise most of 
to much, by not knowing, what is right. Which errors I will handle there, 
where I amend them streight, as I will tuch <hi>custom</hi> somwhat more, 
when I com to that place, where theie appeal vnto <hi>sound</hi> from both 
<hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>When theie haue delt thus with <hi>custom</hi>, and their contraries (which 
theie make contraries, by mistaking, being their frinds in dede) without 
marking their reasons, or by whose autoritie <hi>custom</hi> is established, 
which theie so impugn by suggestion of a counterfeat, then theie begin to 
complain sore of the insufficiencie, and pouertie of our letters, which 
letters tho theie be as manie in number, as other tungs haue, yet theie 
suffise not, saie theie, for the full and right expressing of our sounds, tho 
theie expresse them after a soft, but enforce vs to vse a number of them 
like the <hi>Delphik</hi> sword, whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaketh, to manie 
sounds and seruices contrarie to the natur of such an instrument, which was 
made at the first, this letter for that sound. Whereby it commeth to passe, 
that we both write vnproperlie, not answering the sound of that, which we 
saie, and ar neuer like our selues, in anie our writing, but still varie 
according vnto the writers humor, without anie certain direction. 
Whereupon forenners and strangers to wonder at vs, both for the 
vncertaintie in our writing, and the inconstancie in our letters. And is it 
not a great shame that so cunning a nation as the English <pb n="88"/>
is, being of verie good note so manie yeares, either should not espy, or wold 
not amend in all this time, the pouertie of their pen, and the confusion in 
their letter? but both to let their writing run thus still at riot, and them 
selues to be mokt at of foren peple? 


</p>
               <p>If foren peple do maruell at vs, we maie require them with as much, and 
return their wonder home, considering theie themselues be subiect to the 
verie same difficulties, which theie wonder at in vs, and haue no mo letters 
then we haue, and yet both write still, and be vnderstood still, in the midst 
and in the spite of all these insufficiencies: as we also both write and be 
vnderstood, in this our insufficiencie, euen by their confession, which will 
nedes be offended, bycause of insufficiencie. But the common vse of writing 
among those strangers, which agreth so with ours in our most vncertaintie, 
giues me to think, that this complaining of insufficiencie is not generall to 
all neither with them nor with vs, but proper to som few, and particular 
among both, who misliking that theie know not, and not marking that theie 
cannot, therefor blame that theie should not. For if their blaming vpon 
cause, and marking vpon iudgement did concur with their number, tho not so 
great, I should be afraid least theie had the better, bycause the fewer: but 
both the fewer and the weaker to, carie no great force, to condemn in 
iudgement. As other folks also, which se somwhat to, as well as theie, do 
not quite mislike of all their misliking, but desire som redresse, where 
there is cause in dede, tho theie agre not in the mean, how to perform the 
redresse, nor yet in the quantitie, that the error is so great, as these 
insufficienciaries pretend it to be. For we do confesse that this 
multiplicitie, &amp; manifold vse in the force and seruice of our letters, 
wold haue som distinction, whereby to be known, if generall acquaintance 
with our own writing be not sufficient enough, to perceiue that vse, which 
we put down by vse: but withall we defend and maintain the multiplicitie it 
self, as a thing much vsed euen in the best tungs, and therefor not vnlawfull, 
tho there were not distinction. 


</p>
               <p>And again, we do not think, that euerie our <hi>custom</hi> is a plaine 
corruption, wherein generall vse, euen of those same persons, which cannot 
be suspected, but to write with good iudgement, <pb n="89"/>
laie the ground to precept, as the leader to som art, &amp; assurance to the 
pen. And we rest content with the number of our letters. Which number, 
while som kinde of peple do studie to encrease, theie do but cumber our 
tung, both with strange characts, &amp; with nedelesse dipthongs, enforcing 
vs from that, which generall rule hath won, and resteth content with, in all 
the world. And why not but these letters? or why not to manie vses? This 
paucitie and pouertie of letters, hath contented and discharged the best, 
&amp; brauest tungs, that either be, haue bene, shalbe, or can be, &amp; hath 
deliuered by them, both in speche &amp; pen, as great varietie, and as much 
difficultie in all arguments, and as well perceiued of all posteritie thorough 
their means, as possiblie can, either be deliuered, or be vnderstod, by the 
English tung, or yet be deuised by anie English wit. The peple that now vse 
them, &amp; theie that haue vsed them, haue naturallie the same 
instruments of voice, and the same deliuerie in <hi>sound</hi>, for all their 
speaking, that we English men haue, bycause theie be men, as we English 
folk be: and theie sent the vse of the pen to vs, and not we to them. And 
finding in their own vse this necessitie, which you do note, theie fled to 
that help which you think naught, and were bold with their letters, to make 
them serue diuerse turns, somtime with none, somtime with som pretie 
small note of euident distinction. Which kinde of distinguishing theie know 
to be verie trew, whosoeuer be acquainted with the foren letters, and with 
those writers which entreat of them, as I my self will shew, when I both 
mark, and amend at once, tho I deall no further in this place, to auoid 
repetition, both here &amp; there. Neither is there anie difficultie, which 
theie ar not subiect vnto, either in the same, or in the verie like things, as 
wel as we: as I will proue elswhere, euen by comparing the particulars, so 
far and so manie, as nede shall require. And will strangers wonder at vs? 
or do not our own peple that be learned perceiue these things? For in the 
ignorant I require no such discretion. Surelie I think that all peple hauing 
the same naturall instruments to speak by, tho vpon priuat vse som harp 
more of som sounds then others, and som lean more vpon som one instrument 
of speche, then other do, as som the throte, som the teth, and so furth, 
which varietie is popular euen to hole <pb n="90"/>
nations, that yet naturallie all be made able, to sound all speches and all 
letters, if theie be accustomed vnto them, in that age and with those means, 
when and whereby theie be best to be learned: And that it is onelie 
education, and <hi>custom</hi> which maketh the difference, and therefor 
ruleth either all or most in speche, wherein if there be anie <hi>reason</hi>, it 
is not naturall and simple, as in things, but artificiall &amp; compound as in 
speche, vpon such and such a cause in <hi>custom</hi> and consent. And tho the 
<hi>Hebrew</hi> grammarians onelie, do deuide their letters, according to that 
vocall instrument whereupon theie lean most, as som vpon the throte, som 
vpon the rouf of the mouth, som vpon the tung, som vpon the lips, som vpon 
the tethe: yet the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> alone haue not that distinction in natur, 
but euerie peple also which haue throte, tethe, rouf, tung, lips, and with 
those instruments vse the vtterance of sounds. Which is an argument to me, 
both that vse is the mistresse herein, and that he, which soundeth vpon anie 
one by cuntrie vse, maie be smoothed to som other by the contrarie vse, and 
that therefor the same letters will serue all peple, if theie list to frame 
themselues accordinglie. For otherwise why do we persuade our peple to 
sound <hi>Latin</hi> thus, <hi>Greke</hi> thus, <hi>Hebrew</hi> thus, <hi>Italian</hi>
thus, if it be not a thing to be made of acquaintance, by customarie vse? 
And being so, and in all nations so, what nede we mo letters to vtter our 
minde? seing the vttering instruments be all one, and nothing can be 
vttered either for varietie more diuerse, or for difficultie more hard, then 
theie haue vttered, from whom we haue those letters which we haue? 
neither is it anie discredit to our peple to rest content with those letters, 
and with that number, which antiquitie hath allowed, and held for sufficient. 
Is natur therefor baren in vs, which was frutefull in them, bycause we maie 
not inuent, and put somwhat to theirs? No forsoth. But all mankinde is but 
one, without anie respect of either this age, or that age, both to natur hir 
self, and to the God &amp; Lord of natur, and therefor what is giuen to one 
man, or deliuered in one age of common seruice, that is ment to all men, 
&amp; to all ages of men, without further regard to whom, or for whom, but 
still to their benefit: neither is either God himself or natur his minister 
tyed to anie time, for deliuerie of their gifts, but whensoeuer <pb n="91"/>
mans necessitie compells him to seke, then theie help him to find. 
Whereupon we vnderstand, that as no one age bringeth furthe euerie thing, so 
no one age can but confesse, that it hath som one or other particular 
inuention, tho not the self same, bycause it is enough to haue receiued it 
once to vse euer after. As in this case of letters, which perfited once, is 
neuer to be shaken, onelesse a better mean be found to vtter our speche, 
which I shall not se, neither can I forese by anie secret prophecie. In these 
inuentions, tho the first receiuer haue the prerogatiue in taking, yet the hole 
posteritie hath the benefit in vsing, and generallie with greater perfection, 
bycause time and continewance do encrease and proin, which when it is full, 
it is a falt to seke further, as I take it to be in the course of penning. 
Neither is the restraint, for either innouating, altering, or adding to things 
allredie perfited, anie discourtisie in reason, or anie discountenance in 
natur, but a bare deliuerie of a perfit thing to our elder brethern, to be 
conceiued vnto vs: as we in like case, as the transporters to our posteritie, 
of such things as it pleaseth God to continew by our means, whether 
receiued of our elders, or deuised by our selues. 


</p>
               <p>But why maie we not vse all our four and twentie letters, euen to four and 
twentie vses euerie of them, if occasion serue, seing the characts being 
known be more familiar, and easier to be discerned, then anie new deuise, 
yea tho the old resemble mo, and the new do note but one? It hath bene 
sufficientlie declared allreadie, that those men, which first deuised letters, 
reserued the authoritie ouer them and their vse to them selues for life, and 
their successors for euer, so to qualify and to vse them, as it should please 
them best vpon consent among themselues, and cause to content nede. And 
why not so, where both the inuention is their own, and the right vse thereof, 
as theie shall vse it, which made it for their vse? This generall reseruation 
is enrold allredie in all reason and antiquitie, and the particular consent for 
this writing of ours is proined allredie, by our generall vse, and wilbe 
regestred also in verie good record, I hope, and that shortelie. And will you 
make that souerain, which is but subaltern? or will you take that, as not 
remoueable, like a steddie rok, which is roming by <pb n="92"/>
natur, and to serue the finder? There is no such assurance in <hi>sound</hi>
for the stablishing of a right, as you do coneiue, neither such necessitie in 
letters, to be constant in one vse, as you seke to enforce. 


</p>
               <p>The <hi>philosopher</hi> saith, that natur makes one thing to one vse, and that 
euerie vse hath his particular instrument naturallie, but that our own 
inuentions, naie that euen the most naturall means in our application do, and 
maie serue to sundrie ends &amp; vses. And will letters stand so vpon their 
reputation, as not to seme to stand to our applying of them, for our own 
purposes, being both our creaturs, &amp; by creation our bondmen? both to 
<hi>sound</hi> and serue, as we shall think it good, and so manie waies, as we 
shall will them to serue? No surelie, theie do not think so, but theie ar 
most redie to serue at our appointment, both by creation, &amp; by couenant. 
The letters yeild redilie, but som letters seke to hinder that their dewtifull 
obedience, threaping still vpon them, that their substance is diamantish, and 
not born to yeild so. 


</p>
               <p>With the same pen we make letters, and with the same we mar them: with 
the same we direct, and with the same we dash, which be contrarie vses, 
tho to compas one right, and will letters seme to serue but for one vse, 
being pewnies to the pen, naie being but elues and brats of the pens breding? 
Theie will not so, but proue their own dewtifulnesse, to the pen their 
parent, by following his direction in verie manie points, as theie yeild to 
<hi>reason</hi> and reasonable <hi>custom</hi> in manie of their forces, 
whereby theie seme to praie som bodie not to contend, where themselues be 
content. 


</p>
               <p>The number of things, whereof we write and speak is infinite, the words 
wherewith we write and speak, be definite and within number. Whereupon 
we ar driuen to vse one, and the same word in verie manie, naie somtime in 
verie contrarie senses, and that in all the verie best languages, as well as in 
English, where a number of our words be of verie sundrie powers, as, 
letters, wherewith we write, &amp; letters which hinder: A bird flieth 
light, wheresoeuer she doth light: and to manie to stand on here. And will 
letters kepe a countenance and stand so alouf, as to sound still but one, and 
to serue still but one, where their great grandfathers euen the words 
themselues, ar forced to be <pb n="93"/>
manifold? naie verie well content so to be, bycause of their founders 
stature? which is to be pliable, and at voluntarie commandement, of 
wisdom and learning? letters stand not alouf, but allow of the seruice, 
whereunto you allot them, be it neuer so manifold, seing without either 
confusion or darknesse, customarie acquaintance will work the distinction 
in them, &amp; their manifoldnesse: as a beaten disputer will sift out the 
difference of manifold words, that the varietie of their sense, make no 
quarell in the question. If we write not allwaie one, thorough want of skill, 
&amp; mere ignorance, then knowledge is the helper, and he that will vse 
right, must haue desire to learn right. 


</p>
               <p>If there want distinction, then accent must be mean to auoid confusion, or 
som such deuise, which maie distinguish with praise, and not pester the 
writing, with anie to od strangenesse. For it is most certain, that we maie 
vse our letters so, as we maie all other things else, whose end is in vse, and 
man is the measur. Neither is it anie abuse, when theie which vse, can giue 
a reason why, sufficient to the wise, and not contrarie to good custom. And 
tho som reply, as not so perswaded, yet when the act is past by diuision of 
the house, it is law by parlement. Then the repliers must relent, and follow, 
tho theie fauor not. Then must theie make the best of that, which theie 
thought worst, when as lawfull autoritie hath restrained their will. A thing 
fre before order being once limited by order hath cast of that fredom, and 
must then kepe that currant, wherevnto it is limited, by orderlie mean, it 
self being such, as is subiect vnto man, and to be his at vse. 


</p>
               <p>Our letters be limited, their vsage is certain in their most vncertaintie, and 
therefor I take it, that we maie rest content both with their number and 
their vse. Thus much concerning that complaint of our pouertie in letters, 
and confusion in their powers, which I wonder not at, bycause I se it so in 
all tungs, &amp; euer: &amp; I se no cause why, but it maie be so in our own 
inuentions &amp; deuises, where we are to take knowledge of nothing else, 
but of our own consent, both by best iudgements of the wisest men, and the 
right resemblance of least corrupt natur. 


</p>
               <p>When theie haue thus vttered their stomak against poor <pb n="94"/>
niknamed <hi>custom</hi>, which is sore abused, both by them for blaming it 
vndeseruedlie, and by corruption to, for counterfaiting it shamefullie: when 
theie haue moued our writing for much insufficiencie and bewailed our 
speaking for pouertie of letters, then like good physicians, and tender harted 
cuntrimen, theie seke both to satisfie <hi>iustice</hi> in dewie, and <hi>Art</hi>
in help. As theie find a wrong, so theie seke to right it, as theie mark a 
sore, so theie mean to salue it. But who shall be the iusticiarie like som 
one <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi>, to pronounce sentence in this right? or who the 
physician like som graue <hi>Hippocrates</hi>, to ouerse this cure? forsooth 
<hi>sound</hi>, for whose vse letters were deuised first, when there were yet 
none, and by whose ear theie ar now to be reclamed, being corrupt and 
naught. And why not? Or if these that we haue will not serue <hi>sounds</hi>
turn, why maie we not inuent or deuise mo, considering our want is not 
wonder? For we came but latelie to vse letters, in comparison of the old 
peple in other nations of the main continent, &amp; felt not our want at the 
first wearing: but now that we fele it, why maie we not help our selues, 
with the deuise of som new letters, as other peple did in the like cases by 
som <hi>Esdras</hi>, som <hi>Palamedes</hi>, som <hi>Cadmus</hi>, som 
<hi>Euander</hi>, som <hi>Carmenta</hi>, and such other? <hi>Custom</hi> is 
condemned allredie, as a false corrupter, and sound semes to be the surest, 
and the best gide euen by naturall direction, and the primitiue letter. And 
not so much as but euen <hi>Quintilian</hi> that great writing, and speaking 
master wisheth <hi>sound</hi> to be obserued, as the surest teacher to write 
right, and not <hi>custom</hi>. And what a monstruous iniurie were it, to 
renounce the naturall Lord, and to becom subiect to a vile vsurper? To leaue 
<hi>sound</hi> the right master, and to cleaue to <hi>custom</hi> the right 
matter? Sure the verie name of a naturall Lord is honorable, and the bare 
sound of vsurpation is extreme odious to anie honest ear: And right 
<hi>sound</hi>, as a right souerain were to be obeied, and corrupt 
<hi>custom</hi>, as an vniust intruder were to be expelled. 


</p>
               <p>But doth <hi>Quintilian</hi> plead for <hi>sound</hi> against <hi>custom</hi> I 
praie you? Sure either you be merie men, or my memorie faills me much. 
For <hi>Quintilian</hi> defineth <hi>custom</hi> verie solemnlie, and vpon great 
deliberation, as I remember, to be in writing and speaking, the consent of 
the skilfull, as in vertuous life, the consent <pb n="95"/>
of the honest. Of the which two kindes of peple, as neither corrupters 
in dede: so either wold be angrie to be accounted so in speche. Theie do 
both condemn all error and corruption. And <hi>Quintilian</hi> speaking of 
<hi>sound</hi>, saieth expresslie, and in plaine terms, that euerie thing is to 
be writen, not as the <hi>sound</hi> giues, but as <hi>custom</hi> hath won 
(which <hi>custom</hi> directeth not <hi>sound</hi>, but the expressing of 
<hi>sounds</hi>) and he bringeth in for example, <hi>Caius Cæsar, Cneius 
Pompeius</hi>, in whose forenames the eie beholdeth C, but the ear heareth G. 
which the <hi>Grekes</hi> vsing those names translate still by G. and the same 
he proueth also by manie mo the like. As why not so? To win 
<hi>Quintilian</hi>, naie to wring <hi>Quintilian</hi> to stand for sound against 
<hi>custom</hi>, by falsifying of euidence &amp; corruption of print, where 
both his examples trewlie printed, and his hole meaning planelie printed, 
and his generall circumstances neuer but right printed bewraie his right 
opinion, argeweth som infirmitie in the alledger, who wil not se what is 
ment euerie where about him, or cannot se at all how to chek a false print, 
either by councell of cunning, if he haue it him self, or by comparing of 
prints, where the trewer maie be had. Naie saith not <hi>Quintilian</hi> thus 
of ortografie in generall, that it is seruant to <hi>custom</hi>, and therefor is 
so oft changed? 


</p>
               <p>As for the autoritie, which <hi>sound</hi> alone had in the prouince of writing, 
and the vse of the letter, the date thereof is out long ago. <hi>Reason</hi> and 
right <hi>custom</hi> be ioyned vnto him in the same commission. Besides 
that, Art hath limited and bounded his regiment sence that time. Much he 
can do still, but not so much, as all, neither anie thing so much, as he could 
once haue done. But this argument, concerning the dissolution of 
<hi>sounds</hi> gouernment, hath bene allredie handled in the 12. title of this 
book. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quintilians custom</hi> is no corrupter, neither yet is <hi>sound</hi> but a 
naturall Lord, tho nothing so absolut, ne yet so imperiall, as you conceiue of 
him, and tho the letters were first deuised for him, yet both the letters, and 
euen <hi>sound</hi> himself, must be ruled by them, which both sound letters, 
and vtter sounds. 


</p>
               <p>If nede be, the encrease of our number is not denied vs as <pb n="96"/>
not to other peple, but the nede is denyed, bycause we entred vpon other 
peples most perfit inuentions, and tho later in time, yet so much the surer, 
bycause all things necessarie were deuised to our hands: and bycause our 
nede can be no new nede. Whatsoeuer we nede to write, we are able to write 
it, &amp; when we haue writ it, we ar able to read it. If there be anie falt, 
the remedie must be, not to seke that, which we haue not, but to mark that, 
which we haue, seing we haue all sufficient. 


</p>
               <p>The credit of <hi>sound</hi> being well established in their opinion, as the 
naturall lord, and the leader to all our letters, and custom being condemned, 
as a cankard traitor, intruding against all right, vpon the territorie of 
<hi>sound</hi>, then theie turn to the cure of this diseased corruption, &amp; 
praie <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to be iudge. To amend that which is amisse in the 
writing of our tung, their ground work being laid in the shaken monarchie of 
the deposed <hi>sound</hi>, theie procede on in a full course of generall 
innouation, tho som more, som lesse. First theie encrease the number of our 
letters and diphthongs, as if it were not possible either heretofore to haue 
write, or at this daie to write anie word right, for want of som encrease in 
the number of our letters. For as the ouercharging of our words with to 
manie letters cummeth by vsing those to much, which we haue allredie: so 
the difficultie thereof by vsing them so diuerslie procedeth of mere want, 
not hauing wherewith to answer ech particular. 


</p>
               <p>Then theie change the form of our letters, and bring vs in new faces, of 
verie strange lineaments, how well fauored to behold, I am sure I know: how 
vnredie for a penman, wherewith to run, methink I forese. Which redinesse 
in the charact, that it follow the hand roundlie, is a speciall seruice 
belonging to the pen. Neither do I my self in these obseruations, so much 
regard, what the print will stamp well, which will expresse anie thing well, 
whose form is resemblable, as what the pen will write well, and that with 
good dispatch, bycause printing is but a peculiar, and a benefit impropriate: 
writing is our generall, and in euerie mans finger. A form that is fair to the 
eie in print, &amp; cumbersom to the hand in penning, is not to passe in 
writing. For what but that causeth our English pen to vse z. so seldom, 
which we hear so often? Bussing, hussie, dissie, go roundlie to the <pb n="97"/>
pen with the duble ss, but verie vnredilie with the duble z, Buzzing, huzzie, 
dizzie. Vse hath won ss. &amp; the pens redinesse, is the prouf to perswade 
it. To conclude, this saie theie is the onelie help to amend all misses: for 
defect, to enlarge: for old &amp; corrupt, to bring in new &amp; correct: 
nede enforceth redresse, &amp; dewtie them. 


</p>
               <p>Sure a good care, and a cuntriemanlike affection, but methink 
<hi>Hippocrates</hi>, which was ouerseer, allowes not the receit. For what? 
must we then alter all our writings a new? or from what daie is this act of 
reformation to take full place? It is a strange point of physik, when the 
remedie it self is more dangerous then the disease. Besides that: I take 
this alteration in this sort, to be neither necessarie, where no such 
insufficiencie is, neither yet commodious, where such inconueniences 
follow. For speche being an instrument, and a mean to vtter that, which the 
minde conceiueth, if by the deliuerie of the mouth, the minde be vnderstood, 
the speche is sufficient, which so fullie answereth so nedefull a purpos. If 
writing, where vnder I comprehend both the print &amp; pen, do so fullie 
expresse the pith of the voice, as the reader maie, &amp; doth vnderstand 
the writers meaning at full thereby, I maie not perswade him, that the 
letters which he readeth be not sufficient to expresse the writers meaning, 
which he is redie to confute by present triall, that both he vnderstandeth 
them, and withall most sufficientlie. 


</p>
               <p>But these insufficienciaries will saie, that this vnderstanding cums not by 
the right of the writing, but by the intelligent reader, which vnderstands 
that right, by the so vsuall, the so corrupt writing, which is vnperfitlie, and 
vnproperlie writen: and that the proprietie in penning is ill refused, which 
maie be had easilie with verie small straning. 


</p>
               <p>I like the reason well, as I confesse som imperfection. But neither is the 
imperfection so great, as theie conceiue of it, neither is their reason so 
nere to redresse, as theie think it is. As for the imperfection, how it 
cummeth, and which waie to help it, my hole labor will proue that in euent. 
For their reason I cannot se that, which theie call a small straning bycause 
theie alter quite, or at the least, theie change the surface quite, which in 
this case, where the proprietie in writing is the possession of <hi>custom</hi>
being so grounded as I haue allredie declared, is to great a <pb n="98"/>
straning, chefelie, where <hi>custom</hi> being so sure and sound, will not be 
content to be ouerruled in his own: or that anie reformation shall enter 
clame, where he is proprietarie, howsoeuer priuat mens conceits, vpon neuer 
so probable apparences, framed in their own opinion, shall offer assistence 
to the contrarie side. 


</p>
               <p>The vse &amp; <hi>custom</hi> of our cuntrie, hath allredie chosen a kinde of 
penning, wherein she hath set down hir relligion, hir lawes, hir priuat and 
publik dealings: Euerie priuat man according to the allowance of his cuntrie 
in generall, hath so drawn his priuat writings, his euidence, his letters, as 
the thing semeth vnpossible to be remoued by anie so strange an alteration, 
tho it be most willing to receiue som reasonable proining, so that the 
substance maie remain, and the change take place in such points onelie, as 
maie please without noueltie, and profit without forcing. For were it not in 
good sooth, to violent a force, to offer to ouerthrow a <hi>custom</hi>, so 
generallie receiued, so particularlie setled, naie grounded so soundlie, and 
sure, as it shall appear shortlie, with altering either all, or most of our 
letters? Were it not an argument of a verie simple orator, to think that he 
could perswade <hi>custom</hi>, by so strange an innouation, to diuorse 
himself from so long, and so lawfull a match? Naie were it not a wonderfull 
wish, euen but to wish that all our English scriptur &amp; diuinitie, all our 
lawes and pollicie, all our euidence &amp; writings, were pend anew, 
bycause we haue not that set down in writing, which our elders did wish vs, 
but either more, which theie ment not, or lesse, which we wold not, or not 
so as both theie ment &amp; we wold? all this cumming of the 
insifficiencie of our writing, which is not able, to set that faithfullie &amp; 
fullie down, which the minde conceiueth, but either we the more, or the 
lesse, or disagreing in the maner? But theie will saie that theie mean not 
anie so main a change. But theie must nedes mean it, bycause it must either 
presentlie follow vpon the admitting of this new alteration, which is to 
main in sense, or within som years, which is to main in thought. For a new 
writing cumming in vnder hand, &amp; the old charact growing out of 
knowledge, all that euidence in whatsoeuer English kind, must nedes either 
com ouer to the new fashion, or be subiect to the frump, &amp; remain 
wormeaten like an old relik, &amp; so to be red, as the Romain religion, 
writen vnder <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was by then of <hi>Tullies</hi> time, 
when euerie word was <pb n="99"/>
so vncouth &amp; strange, as if it had cum from som other world, then 
where it was penned. But am I not in hand with a nedlesse trauell, not 
allowing that, which I nede not fear, bycause there is no danger in it, the 
verie vse of our cuntrie refusing it allredie? I grant I am. But yet I must 
saie somwhat, not to seme to contemn: as if I saie nothing, the contrarie 
then maie seme to haue said som thing. But sure I take the thing to be 
profitable, but where no likeliehood of anie profit at all doth appear in 
sight, &amp; the change it self semeth, neither necessarie as to the better, 
neither voluntarie, as to the readier, which be two principall respects in 
writing, I allow not the mean, tho I mislike not the men, which deserue 
great thanks for their great good will, tho their works take no place. For 
their labor is verie profitable to help som redresse forward, tho themselues 
hit it not. For while diuerse men attempt to laie the thing in certain, som 
one or other will hit it at the last, whereas to the contrarie, the case were 
desperat, if it were neuer delt in. But this amendment of theirs is to far 
set, and without the help thereof we vnderstand our print and pen, our 
euidence and other writing, in what kinde soeuer. And tho we grant som 
imperfection, as in a tung not yet rakt from hir trubled lees, yet we do not 
confesse, that it is to be perfited either by altering the form, or by 
encreasing the number of our acquainted letters, but onelie by obseruing, 
where the tung of her self, &amp; hir ordinarie <hi>custom</hi> doth yeild to 
the fining, as the old, &amp; therefor the best method doth lead vs. For it is 
no argument, when falts be found, to saie this is the help &amp; onelie this, 
bycause none other is in sight. But whensoeuer the right is found by orderlie 
seking, then the argument is trew, that it was not thoroughlie sought, when 
it was denied to be. And to speak indifferentlie betwen the letter &amp; the 
<hi>sound</hi>, of the one side, &amp; <hi>custom</hi> &amp; the letter, of the 
other side: letters can expresse <hi>sounds</hi> withall their ioynts &amp; 
properties, no fuller then the pencill can the form &amp; lineaments of the 
face, whose praise is not life but likenesse: as the letters yeld not alwaie 
the same, which <hi>sound</hi> exactlie requireth, but allwaie the nearest, 
wherwith <hi>custom</hi> is content. And therefor if a letter <hi>sound</hi> not 
iump as ye wish, yet hold it as the next, least if you change you cum not so 
near. And tho one letter be vsed in diuerse <pb n="100"/>
naie, in contrarie <hi>sounds</hi>: or <hi>soundish</hi> effects, ye cannot auoid 
it by anie change that wilbe liked, seing no one else hath bene liked hitherto, 
but this which we vse, which custom doth allow in ours by continuance, and 
consent in other tungs confirmeth by allowance. Certainlie by so much as I 
haue obserued, I think we ar as well appointed for our necessities that waie, 
and as much bound to our generall custom, for the artificiall notes of our 
naturall tung, as anie other peple is, to anie other language, whether ancient 
in books, or modern in speche. And whatsoeuer insufficiencie semeth to be 
in the writing thereof, it will excuse it self, and laie the hole falt vpon the 
insufficient obseruer, for not seking the right in it, by a right waie, which 
will appear to be trew, when it shalbe sene, that by sufficient obseruation 
it maie be set clear, and pure, without anie foren help, of either altering the 
form, or encreasing the number of our orindarie letters, but onelie by bare 
notes of hir own breding, which being allredie in vse desire nothing else, but 
som direction by Art, which I am in good hope to perform, according to the 
plat of the best refiners, in the most refined tungs, with such consideration 
as either bredeth anie generall rules, or else must bear with particular 
exceptions. I will mark what our customarie writing will yeild vnto vs by 
waie of note, without dreaming of change, which change is a thing not 
possible to passe against so violent a fall, as custom runs with, tho that 
violence it self offer no kinde of wrong to anie other thing, being altogether 
full of hir own stream. I will therefor do my best to confirm our 
<hi>custom</hi> in his own right, which will be easilie obtained, where men be 
acquainted with the matter allredie, and wold be verie glad to se wherein 
the right of their writing standeth, and a great deall more glad to find it so 
near, when theie sought it, and thought it to be further of. Thus haue I run 
thorough these pretended infimrities in our tung, whose physiking I like not 
this waie, and therefor I will ioyn close with mine own obseruation, to se if 
that will help.

               <head>What right in writing is, and of what force consent is in voluntarie inuentions.</head>
               <pb n="101"/>
               <p>BYcause I pretend the finding out of a right in writing, and withall confesse 
that that right must bild vpon consent, I will therefor shew first, what a 
thing that is, which we call right both in speche and pen: then what force 
consent is of, to establish anie thing, where manie voices ar nedefull. 
<hi>Theodor Gaza</hi>, a great learned <hi>Grecian</hi> defineth that to be 
<hi>right</hi> in speche, for euerie part &amp; accident thereof, which is 
commonlie vsed in that kinde, and euer lightlie so, naie neuer lightlie but so, 
and allwaie the surest, and of the best warrant, notwithstanding particular 
exceptions, and priuate notes. For speche being our instrument at will, for 
our common dealings, why should not that be the right therein, which is of 
commonest note, and best vnderstood? which kinde of common notice, who 
so euer he be, that shall follow in the right of his writing, besides the truth 
of the things, confirmed by custom, and the autoritie of custom confirmed 
by consent, he maketh for him self a great partie, &amp; by writing as the 
generalitie doth, he gaineth the generalitie to be of his side, which is redie 
to allow of their own choice, &amp; vsuallie loue, where theie find them 
selues liked, hauing autoritie to establish both their own assurance, and the 
writers direction. Opposition to the common vpon fauor to the priuat, as 
preferring priuat fantsie before generall vse, or as if you alone had espyed, 
where all else be deceiued, assureth you of two things, the one, to be 
generallie misliked for our particular choice, where the generalitie is chefe: 
the other, neuer to be followed for bewraing such a fantsie, which is alredie 
and altogither out of grace with the common. For why? when the custom of 
your cuntrie alloweth this as best, and therefor fittest for hir perpetuall 
seruice, doth she not then tell you, by seruing hir own generall, that she saw 
your speciall? For how could choice haue taken place, if both the 
extremities had not bene in sight? Therefor he calleth his own credit into 
som question, which taketh his cuntrie to be blind, where both the matter of 
hir choice, and the maner of hir speche declaring hir choice most euidentlie 
shew, that she seith what she saith. 


</p>
               <p>I know som men which haue contraried all our latin grammer rules, as not so 
generallie trew that waie, which theie ar vsed, but euen as trew of the 
contrarie side, bycause theie haue <pb n="102"/>
som examples in the tung, repugnant as theie think to the rules, which be 
giuen. Whose error is in that theie do not consider, that our <hi>commonlie 
so</hi>, and not their <hi>allwaie so</hi>, is right in such cases: and that such 
wise men, as gathered the rules, when theie pikt the finenest did laie out a 
drosse, and that he which resteth vpon the most and best, by comparison 
confesseth a lesse and a worse. Such peple dream that other men se not 
when themselues be aslepe, &amp; by not comparing themselues with other, 
ouerwene their own abilities. But vpon this right most <hi>commonlie so</hi>, 
where choice hath found reason to ioyn withall in companie, must both 
speche be grounded, and their interest examined, which will ouerrule speche 
by their to much priuat reason. For he that pretendeth a falt against anie 
tung &amp; amendeth not that falt, but deuiseth a new right, of his own 
conceiuing, helpeth not the old falt, but by tendering a new mean, offereth 
more matter to the finding of new falts, while men will rather be content to 
embrase their old, with all knowen falts, then to ventur vpon a new, theie 
know not how good. 


</p>
               <p>I shall not nede to vse anie learned mans testimonie of name more then 
<hi>Gaza</hi> alone, to proue that this <hi>most commonlie so</hi>, is the onelie 
right in writing and speaking, and what a great commander <hi>custom</hi>, 
when theie deall with him in this kinde, but of that his dominion ouer 
speche, and pen. And theie that be learned know, that all such, as deall in 
speche, whether pithilie with <hi>logik</hi>, or plausiblie with 
<hi>rhetorik</hi>, or purelie with <hi>gramer</hi>, do laie it down in plain terms 
of vse and <hi>custom</hi>, that for speche and pen, the rule and resolution 
thereof goeth still so, as vse best alloweth, &amp; as <hi>custom</hi> most 
commandeth, whose choice lyes in that which is <hi>commonlie so</hi>, vpon 
best shew &amp; sharpest cause. The vnlearned also in their dailie 
experience, maie well perceiue, that the thing is so by the liking and 
misliking, by the rising and decaing of sundrie words, and phrases of speche, 
in their ordinarie dealings, as either youth, and fresh cause preferreth the 
new, and as age and ouerwearing displaceth the old. So that who so will 
enforce the contrarie to that, which <hi>custom</hi> and vse do take to 
protection, as practised by the most, and not disproued by the best, which is 
the reason of my <pb n="103"/>
plat in fining of speche euen from the verie first, shall not possible preuail, 
as maie be well perceiued by manie fair attempts, which can find no entrie, 
where theie haue attempted all. 


</p>
               <p>As for <hi>consent</hi> this I haue to saie, that it did both beget letters and gaue 
them their forces, at the verie first, to expresse the sound of the articulate 
voice, and that from time to time it hath so altered, and vsed them vpon 
nedefull cause, by lawfull autoritie of it self, confirming it self, as theie 
haue followed that course, which <hi>consent</hi> hath commanded, and good 
reason why? For mens nede being the onelie cause, why theie fly to new 
deuises, whereby to supply that nede? if theie themselues do confesse their 
own nede to be supplyed by such a mean, as theie haue found out, will you 
seke further prouf thereof, then their own confession, which both found the 
want, and fele the help? And if vpon som longer, and therefor better trauell, 
theie do find that the thing, which theie liked on at the first excedinglie 
well, while the misliking of their want persuaded the well liking of anie 
thing at all, which serued for supply, must afterward be qualifyed much 
otherwise, then it was at the first, to be made proper to al performances, 
which their nede requireth, will ye not beleue them in that, which theie both 
find and fele? whether you do or not, the truth will, and pronounceth 
peremptorilie that <hi>custom</hi> doth, and must rule in all such cases, 
where manie ar to practis a thing, of their own procurement, but most of all 
there, where theie haue practised allredie, and ar most willing to continew 
in that, the which theie haue practise, as in this our writing. Wherefor it 
shall please my good cuntrimen to giue their consent, that this is their right 
in writing, without further parlementing, it will proue so in dede. And why 
it should be so I will alledge verie fair, and yet nothing else, but that, which 
euen theie themselues vse in their dailie writing: wherein as theie maie be 
iudges of the matter vpon familiaritie with it: so will I frame the mean to 
ascertain the matter, according vnto the president of all the best tungs.

            <div xml:id="c1.16" type="chapter">
               <head>The seuen means to find out, and ascertain the right writing of English.</head>
               <pb n="104"/>
               <p>IT hath bene not onelie said, but also proued allredie, and that in euerie 
particular branch thereof, how the first mean, which was vsed for the fining 
of the first tung, and was afterward transported to the fining of other, to 
work the same effect in them by following the same president, did procede 
in working by these degres. First the <hi>sound</hi> alone did rule the pen, 
bycause the letters were first deuised, onelie to resemble, and expresse the 
sound by their aspectable figur. But verie manie inconueniences did follow 
while that <hi>sound</hi> alone did command the pen, bycause of the 
difference in the instruments of our voice, wherewith we sound: bycause of 
the finenesse or grossenesse of the ear, wherewith we receiue sounds: 
bycause of the iudgement or ignorance in the partie, which is to pronounce, 
of the right or wrong expressing of the sound. For the auoiding whereof, the 
peple, which found these inconueniences, and the causes why to be in the 
imperfection of their gide, while <hi>sound</hi> alone was the leader in 
writing, ioyned <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> in commission with 
<hi>sound</hi>: <hi>Reason</hi> to obserue where the sternnesse of <hi>sound</hi>
were to be followed, and where to be qualified, bycause letters resemble 
the ioynts in <hi>sound</hi>, but ar not the same with the things resembled: 
<hi>Custom</hi> to confirm that by experience in the pen, which <hi>reason</hi>
doth obserue, and note the <hi>sound</hi>. But all these thre the proprietie of 
<hi>sound</hi>, the qualifying of <hi>reason</hi>, the experimenting of 
<hi>custom</hi> consisting as yet in the bare vnrecorded, and vnwriten vse, 
wherein euerie mans brain was euerie mans book, and euerie priuat conceit a 
particular print, diuerse and great corruptions began to encroche again, 
against both <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi>, to restore <hi>sound</hi> to his 
first monarchie, &amp; to force <hi>custom</hi> against the common currant. 
Which attempts of error and misuse (for these two be <hi>sounds</hi>
principal frinds, in the maintenance of his vnlawfull autoritie) <hi>reason</hi>
and <hi>custom</hi> vpon great causes did mightilie withstand, and praied help 
of Art, as an autorised notarie, to write all those things down in precept and 
method, wherein <hi>sound, reason,</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> all thre had 
consented and agreid, <pb n="105"/>
&amp; were not to be shaken by anie insolence of corruption, if the 
bands of their consent &amp; agrement were once made, subscribed, sealed, 
&amp; deliuered, as all their thre dedes. Which being don all quarells were 
ended, and the rule of right writing was so enrold before such officers of 
state, as it was but vaine for <hi>sound</hi>, or for anie of his fauorers, euer 
to striue thencefurth for anie monarchie alone, tho he continew stil in verie 
great autoritie. 


</p>
               <p>This course took the first finers to bring their pen to an artificiall right: 
this the rest followed, and this course will I take, by the grace of God, to 
bring my cuntrie writing to precept &amp; method, by the help ofArt, 
registring the argument of <hi>reason</hi>, <hi>custom</hi>, and <hi>sound</hi> in 
the writing thereof, with as good deliberation and faith, as my cunning can 
compas, and as the natur of such an argument will admit assurance. Wherein 
I will lean vnto all the thre, for the matter, as to Art alone for the maner. 


</p>
               <p>The right writing of our English therefor by waie of discription is, a certain 
reasonable course, to direct the pen by such rules, as ar most conformable, 
to the proprietie of <hi>sound</hi>, the consideration of <hi>reason</hi>, &amp; 
the smoothing of <hi>custom</hi> ioyntlie, speciallie in those points of our 
writing where there is som difficultie &amp; disagrement both in opinion of 
the writers, &amp; in natur of the letters, concerning to much, to litle, or to 
diuerse. <hi>To much</hi>, as the dubling of consonants in the end of a word, 
as putt, grubb, ledd, for put, grub, led, and a thowsand such ignorant 
superfluties. Whereas the rule is, that no consonant must be dubled in anie 
word at all, or in anie place of the word at all, but onelie where either 
consonant belongeth to seuerall syllabs, as in syl-lab. witting, sauing ff, 
and ll, in the end vpon great occasions, which shalbe noted hereafter. <hi>To 
litle</hi>, as fech, scrach, herafter, singlie for fetch, scratch, hereafter, 
singelie: where for the first two the rule is, that, t, is to be writen before 
ch, in such deruiatiues, as haue t, in the primitiue, as set, scrat, which is so 
much vsed as it maketh a rule of it self allmost, and causeth t, be 
commonlie writen, euen where either there is no primitiue at all with t, or 
not anie in such a sense, as the deriuatiue semes to be of. For the last, the 
rule is, that our English compounds ar lightlie made of the hole simples, 
without leasing one letter: and that if anie be left out, it is figuratiuelie by 
either contraction, as single for singlelie, <pb n="106"/>
or for redinesse in writing without further reason, which is most 
sene in the silent e, whereof I will speak hereafter. As in therin, 
loftinesse, for therein, loftienesse. <hi>To diuerse</hi>, as in choíce 
anoìnt, boùght, boúght, sòm, hóme, &amp;vgravese, 
&amp;vacutese òf òf, ìf, íf gìue gíue, lòue 
lóue, mòther, móther, recòrd, recórde, and a 
number mo such, which be the chefe caues why our writing is so charged 
with so great confusion. And yet all this great confusion is easilie to be 
certained, without anie more ado, then the mere following of <hi>reason, 
custom</hi>, and <hi>sound</hi>, in our own tung, as shalbe plainelie proued. 
And if there nede anie difference, or distinction to the eie, for directing 
either the English infant, which must learn, or the infantish stranger, which 
desires to learn, som litle note of distinction, or som known accent ouer the 
lesse vsuall will auoid that confusion, which is so much pretended, and 
confirm it self by following the first tungs, in that kinde of distinguishing. 
The two points of <hi>to much</hi> &amp; <hi>to litle</hi> wilbe soon redressed, 
as most what proceding from the ignorant writer, which will reform 
himself, when he shal se cause why, and a corrected president, the which he 
maie follow. The last for <hi>diuersitie</hi> is a matter of mere cumber, and 
yet shalbe so handled, as I do not fear, but to win both consent and 
allowance. For the helping of these vnrulie fellowes, and the certaining of 
our pen, I do follow these seuen precepts, <hi>Generall Rule, Proportion, 
Composition, Deriuation, Enfranchisment, distinction</hi>, and 
<hi>Prerogatiue</hi>. The causes why I haue reduced all the obseruations of 
our right writing, to these seuen heads be these. The first thing, that is 
considered in anie compound matter, is the simples whereon the compound 
is made, which in this argument is the natur of ech letter. Whose generall 
examining, and ascertaining I haue recommended to the first of my seuen 
precepts, which I call <hi>generall rule</hi>. The next thing that is considered 
in a compound is the vse and handling of the simples, which make the 
composition, being put to their prouf in the thing compounded. Which prouf 
in this argument consisteth in words, bycause letters do serue for the 
deliuerie of words. Now all words be either mere English, or in corporate 
strangers, which either follow one sutable <hi>sound</hi> in speche, and the 
like resemblance in pen, or agreing in the one, disagre in the other. For the 
certaining of <pb n="107"/>
this vncertaintie, I appoint two precepts of the seuen, <hi>Proportion</hi>, and 
<hi>Enfranchisement</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Again, all words, whether naturall or denisons, be either simple or 
compound, either primitiues or deriuatiues. For the directing whereof two 
other precepts serue, <hi>Composition</hi> and <hi>Deriuation</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Again, bycause the time and quantitie of syllabs, and the tune and qualitie 
thereof do cause somtime much controuersie &amp; diference in the right 
vse of writing, I haue therefor ioyned the rule of <hi>distinction</hi> vnto 
these fiue. Wherein I handle the vse of all those characts, which the eie 
doth behold, either in pen or print besides the letters: bycause those 
characts, do help and qualify the expressing, and vtterance of words and 
sentences, as the letters alone do expresse and vtter them. 


</p>
               <p>Again, bucause both <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> will shew som one trik 
of their priuat autoritie, in the most pride of Art, which dependeth 
altogither of <hi>reason</hi>, I haue therefor knit vp all the seuen with the 
rule of <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, where the generall direction of anie of the other 
is somtime thwarted by natur of exception, occasioned somtime by the 
<hi>sound</hi>, somtime by <hi>custom</hi>, both being desirous to shew their 
own efficacie. All which my rules I refer to the writing, more then to the 
print. For in the print the difficultie is not so soon spyed, as it is in 
writing: bycause the printing charact being once cast in metle, what 
difficultie is there afterward? In the pen which is still to stamp, and to 
make new characts euerie foot, tho of the same form, the commoditie of the 
hand is most to be considered, that the charact be fair to the eie, 
commodious to the ioynt, and swift to dispatch. And therefor he that will 
iudge of my opinion in this argument, wherein my speciall regard is, to the 
facilitie and right in writing, rather then in printing tho the one help the 
other, when it is wel setled, must not mark what the print setteth down in 
the generall stamping, where the printers, setters, and correcters ouersight 
somtimes plaieth a part, and letteth manie errors abide in their work: but 
what I my self do bind my self vnto by mine own precept. For that I will 
warrant, the other I cannot, tho I do what I can. The writing is my chefe 
care, which will be my chefe credit herein, if it proue to be currant, and 
actiue.

               <pb n="108"/>
               <p>I Call the first of those means, whereby the right writing of our English 
tung is to be assured, according to that certaintie, which our common vse 
doth seme to haue chosen <hi>Generall rule</hi>, whose peculiar dewtie is, to 
ascertain our right writing, either by main grounds, teaching thoroughout 
the hole tung, or by limiting the force of euerie particular charact, whether 
it be distinction to help our pronouncing, or else letter, whereby we 
pronounce. By this discription it appeareth, that the rules which belong to 
right writing in this kinde, be either generall to the tung, or particular to 
the charact. The former sort of the two do bak the latter, like the generall 
truth of their maine <hi>reason</hi>, vpon the former, &amp; the particular 
credit of their own argument vpon themselues. And yet theie both haue but 
that assurance in natur, which <hi>reason, custom</hi>, and <hi>sound</hi> haue 
agreid vpon by consent, and willed Art to set it down, as a couenant of 
theirs. The generall rules, which be the main grounds of the hole tung, be 
either known conclusions, allredie handled and won, or such consequents as 
follow them of necessitie, as these be. 


</p>
               <p>1 That the bodie of ech letter and distinction is creatur to deuise, and the 
vse thereof to our consent. 
2 That <hi>reason, sound,</hi> &amp; <hi>custom</hi> direct right writing 
ioyntlie, &amp; ar not to be seuered, in giuing the cause, why words be so 
writen. 
3 That the right in writing is a thing to be found out in our vse, as of 
acquaintance, &amp; not to be forced in vpon our vse, as a stranger. 
4 That in reforming things of common practis the clearing of the old, which 
is abused, and not the breding of a new, which is vntried, is the naturall 
amendment. 
5 That in common executions, the common fauor is the common furtherer. 
6 That euen by reasons leaue the verie pen and dispatch in writing, will 
haue one ore in the right of writing, &amp; serue it self with som priuat 
trik. 
7 That to haue the most well, you must yeild to som particularities <pb n="109"/>
not of best reason. 
8 That no rule of Art can deall so, but it must leaue manie particularities 
to dailie practis, to be learned by oft vsing, and such like obseruations, 
which be common staies both for Art to direct by, and the pen to write by. 
The particular <hi>rule</hi> examineth the force of all such characts, as we 
vse in writing, whereof there be two kindes: the one signifying and 
sounding: the other signifying, but not sounding. Those characts which 
signify but sound not, ar certain notes, which we vse in the writing of our 
English tung for the qualifying of our words, &amp; sentences in their 
pronouncing, by that which is sene in the form of our writing, which be in 
number thirtene, in name &amp; form these: <hi>Coma, Colon: Period. 
Parenthesis (.) interrogation?</hi> the longtime-the short time <note>short 
vowell mark </note> the sharp accent/ the flat accent ` the streight accent 
the seuerer" the vniter-the breaker=. I vse the foren &amp; originall names 
in most of these, bycause both the notes themselues be of a foren brede, and 
theie be commonlie best known by their own cuntrie names: I might darken 
more if I should deuise new names, then by enfranchising of the foren, a 
thing comon to all speches, which vse the translate terms of anie Art. Here 
it shalbe sufficient onelie to shew their number, names and form, I will 
handle their force &amp; vse in the title of distinction, wherevnto theie 
belong naturallie. Those characts which both signify and sound be called 
letters, &amp; concern both the substance and the deliuerie of our sounds, 
and are considered either alone, as a.b.c. or in combination, as the 
diphthongs, ai.aw.ou. the coplements with h.ch.th.gh. the abbreuiations w.y.w. 
of all these I will note somwhat in particular, and first of the single 
letters, whose names be familiar in our daielie vse, their number 24. their 
form either great or small great A.B.C.D.E.F.G.H.I.K.L.M.N.O.P.Q.R.S.T.V.W.X.Y.Z. 
small a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.k.l.m.n.o.p.q.r.s.t.v.u.w.x.y.z. In these letters there are to 
be considered, their place, and their form. As for their place, the great 
letters ar to begin full sentences, as. The kingdom of heauen is redie for the 
repentant. And proper names, as. The cursed <hi>Cain</hi> killed the good 
<hi>Abell</hi>: And to write numbers with, where the letters be vsed in 
numbring, as, C. for an hundred. L. for fiftie, The small letters <pb n="110"/>
place is euerie where else, besides these thre, where the great ar to be 
writen. Som of the small letters, as s. and v. be of mo forms then one, and 
somwhat different therefor in place. The long s. serueth in all places, which 
be capable of the lesse form, sauing the verie last. The other two litle ones, 
s &amp; <note>curly s</note> which is but couert to the small writen s, 
&amp; no abbreuiation indede, comonelie in the end of a word, &amp; that 
vpon such cause, as shalbe noted hereafter. V. begins the word or syllab, and 
is allwaie vsed consonantlike, as u. expresseth the vowell, &amp; in the 
midle or ending syllabs it is vsed for the other form of v. mostwhat for the 
dispatch in writing. This is enough for the number, name, form and place of 
both the great and small letters. Their force is to be considered either 
generallie by diuision, or particularlie by enumeration of euerie single 
letter. For their diuision all the 24. letters be either vowels, as. a.e.i.o.u. or 
consonants, as. b.c.d.f.g.k.l.m.m.p.q.r.s.t.x.z. or in som vses both consonants 
and vowells, as i.v.w.y. besides that h. is an aspiration onelie in power, tho a 
letter in form, and a consonant in som combination, as in the weak ch. chat, 
chip, change. For in the strong ch. as charact, archangell, Christian, it is but 
the aspirat. The consonants be either mutes and close the sound, as 
b.c.d.g.k.p.q.t. or half vowellish as, f.l.m.n.r.s.x.z. which hauing the help of a 
vowell to begin their force continew it themselues a great while after. This 
is enough for the generall diuision of the letters at this time. Their 
enumeration sheweth the force and vse of euerie particular letter in order, 
as I will deall with them, first with the vowells, and then with the 
consonants, and either of their combinations, diphthongs, coplements, and 
abbreuiations. The vowells generallie sound either long, as 
<hi>compāring, reuēnged, endīting, 
enclōsure, presūming</hi>: or short as <hi>ransăking, 
reu&amp;ebrevelling, pen&amp;ibrevetent, omnip&amp;obrevetent, fortŭnat</hi>: 
either sharp, as máte, méte, rípe, hópe, dúke or 
flat as: màt, mèt, rìp, hòp, dùk. Which diuersitie 
in sound where occasion doth require it, is noted with the distinctions of 
time and tune, tho generallie it nede not, considering our daielie custom, 
which is both our best, and our commonest gide in such cases, is our 
ordinarie leader, as in the title of distinction it shalbe handled at large. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111"/>A 


</p>
               <p>A Besides this generall note for the time and tune, hath no particular thing, 
worth the obseruation in this place, as a letter, but it hath afterward in 
proportion, as a syllab. All the other vowells haue manie pretie notes. 


</p>
               <p>E 


</p>
               <p>E Besides the common difference of time and tune, is a letter of maruellous 
vse in the writing of our tung, and therefor it semeth to be recommended 
vnto vs speciallie aboue anie other letter, as a chefe gouernour in the right 
of our writing. Which e, tho it be somtime idlelie writen, either of 
ignorance, if the writer be vnlearned, and know not how to write, or of 
negligence, if he be learned, and mark not his hand, yet most times it is 
writen to great purpos, euen where it semeth idle, before the force of it be 
considered, and hath a verie great saying in ech of the seuen precepts, as 
shalbe declared in euerie of them particularlie. 


</p>
               <p>And first for <hi>rule</hi>, the first of the seuen precepts, this is to be noted 
of E, that it either soundeth or is silent, and that either in the former or in 
the last syllabs. But first of the last, where it either endeth the syllab it 
self, or with som other consonant, or consonants after. When soeuer E, is 
the last letter, and soundeth, it soundeth sharp, as <hi>me, se, we, agre</hi>. 
sauing if <hi>the</hi> the article <hi>ye</hi> the pronouwn, and in Latin words, 
or of a Latin form, when theie be vsed English like, as <hi>certiorare 
quandare</hi>, where e, soundeth full and brode after the originall Latin. 


</p>
               <p>Whensoeuer e, is the last, and soundeth not, it either qualifieth som letter 
going before, or it is mere silent, and yet in neither kinde encreaseth it the 
number of syllabs. I call that E, qualifying, whose absence or presence, 
somtime altereth the vowell, somtime the consonant going next before it. It 
altereth the sound of all the vowells, euen quite thorough one or mo 
consonants as, máde, stéme, éche, kínde, strípe, 
óre, cúre, tóste sound sharp with the qualifying E in their 
end: whereas, màd, stèm, èch, frind, strip, or, cut, tost, 
contract of tossed sound flat without the same E, And therefor the same 
loud <pb n="112"/>
and sharp sound in the word, calleth still for the qualifying e, in the end, as 
the flat and short nedeth it not. It qualifyeth no ending vowell, bycause it 
followeth none in the end, sauing i. as in daie, maie, saie, trewlie, safetie, 
where it maketh i, either not to be heard, or verie gentlie to be heard, which 
otherwise wold sound loud and sharp, and must be expressed by y. as, deny, 
aby, ally. Which kinde of writing shalbe noted hereafter. It altereth also 
the force of, c, g, s, tho it sound not after them, as in hence, for that, which 
might sound henk, if anie word ended in c. in swinge differing from swing, in 
vse differing from vs. I call that e, mere silent, which tho it neither sound, 
nor qualifie anie letter, yet maie it not be spared from the ends of fiue 
kindes of words. First of foren denisons, which ar deriued from originalls 
ending in s, tho being not the last letter of their ending syllab, as, case, 
cause, verse, diuerse, repose, nose. Secondlie of those words, which end in 
s. sounding like a z. and haue a vowell next before the s, as the silent e, 
after, as cruse, excuse, abuse, snese, wise, amase. Thirdlie of words ending 
in v, the consonant, as craue, deceiue, glòue, lòue, thróue, 
móue, shróue. Fourthlie after l, in combination with anie 
consonant, as whistle, gristle, wrestle, wrangle, frisle, britle, trikle. 
sauing where v, the consonant cummeth before l, in the same proportion of 
sound like to these, where the e, is passant (whereof I will saie somwhat 
straight waie) and therefor is writen before the l. tho it shew the verie like 
force, to the mere silent, e, after the l, as diuel, riuel, rauel, shouel. In 
which words, both the ending l, is single, as not bearing the fall of e. like to 
well, knell, swell: and the proportion is like to rifle, wifle, snafle, snufle, 
shuffle. The consonant before l, is not to be dubled, for making two sillabs 
of one, bycause the e, sounds not, which it should do of necessitie, if it 
made a syllab. But why maie not these also be writen, riule, driule, diule, 
&amp; c. letting the consonant v, answer hir cosin f. in wifle, trifle, rifle, 
the kinred betwene them being still so great, as it appeareth in wife, 
wiuè, thrift, thriuè, drift, driuè, and a number such. Fiftlie, 
after the duble ss, in the end, which why it is dubled, it shalbe noted 
hereafter, as witnesse, worthinesse, redresse. For wheresoeuer the long s, 
endeth the word, the silent <pb n="113"/>
e, will follow, like to a silent <hi>Hebrew Sheua</hi> in the ending <hi>K</hi>, 
which theie call <hi>Caph</hi>. Now the form of s, in this dubling must nedes 
be long, bycause it must answer the first, which is long, and therefor must 
nedes haue the silent e. Som vse the same silent e, after r, in the end, as 
<hi>lettre cedre, childre</hi>, and such, where methink it were better to be 
the flat e, before r, as <hi>letter, ceder, childer</hi> and so <hi>childern</hi>
rather then <hi>children</hi>, onelesse ye will form of <hi>childe, childer, 
childeren</hi>, and so by contraction <hi>children</hi>, cutting awaie the 
former e: or <hi>childern</hi>, cutting awaie the latter. 


</p>
               <p>E. when it endeth the last sillab, with one or mo consonants cumming after 
it, either soundeth flat and full, and maketh a syllab, as in <hi>rest, wretch, 
discent</hi>, or it is passant &amp; soundeth quik like the fine gentle i, 
mostwhat not encreasing the number of syllabs as <hi>writen, goten, 
saieth</hi>. This e, <hi>passant</hi> and the gentle, be of such affinitie, as 
theie do oftimes enterchange places, as <hi>indite, induce, intent,</hi> or 
<hi>endite, enduce, entent</hi>. Generallie words that end in the qualifying or 
silent e, when theie put s, vnto them in their deriuatiues, theie make the e, 
passant, as <hi>time, times, wise, wiues, pipe, pipes</hi>. without encrease 
of syllabs, and ar therefor to be speld together. 


</p>
               <p>E, ending anie former syllab soundeth of it self brode, and longish, as 
<hi>reprehend, delegate</hi>, onelesse it be a deriuatiue or compound of som 
sharp ending e, which answereth the primitiue or simple in the first sound, 
as <hi>agreing, of agre, foreseeth,</hi> of <hi>forese</hi>. If it end the syllab 
with anie consonant after, it is flat, as <hi>entending, repentant</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>It is neuer silent in anie former syllab, but in composition, where the hole 
simple word is to be writen, as in <hi>wherefor, herevpon, hencefurth</hi>, in 
the two former, the prerogatiue of custom vsing e, in the end, <hi>where, 
here</hi>, contrarie to the proportion, in <hi>hear, wear, ear</hi>: in the last 
the qualifying e, accompanying hir simple <hi>hence</hi>. In the titles of 
<hi>distinction</hi> and <hi>deriuation</hi> there shalbe more said of the silent 
and qualifying e, both where theie be to be vsed, and where not in the 
respect of the timing and tuning of words. 


</p>
               <p>I 


</p>
               <p>I, besides the time and tune thereof noted before, hath a <pb n="114"/>
form somtime vowellish, somtime consonantish. In the vowellish sound 
either it endeth a former syllab or the verie last. When it endeth, the last, 
and is it self the last letter, if it sound gentlie it is qualified by the e, as 
<hi>manie, merrie, tarie, carie</hi>, where the verie pen, will rather end in the 
e, then in the naked i. 


</p>
               <p>If it sound sharp and loud, it is to e writen with y, hauing no, e, after it, as 
neding no qualification, <hi>deny, cry, defy</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>If it end the last syllab with one or mo consonants after it, it is shrill when 
the qualifying e, followeth, and if it be shrill, the qualifying e, must follow, 
as <hi>repíne, vnwíse, mínde, kínde, físte</hi>. If it 
be flat and quik, the qualifying e, must not follow, as <hi>examin, behind, 
mist, fist</hi>. If it end a former syllab, it soundeth lightlie sharp in 
spelling, and is so to, onelesse it be in a word of manie syllabs, where the 
midle time maie easilie be descried by the vse of speche, as in <hi>pacient, 
penitent, euident, whining, deuising</hi>. These words of manie syllabs be 
lightlie strangers, bycause our naturall English be mostwhat but of one 
syllab. How it will fall out in the former of a word of two syllabs, or of 
som monosyllabs, which seme to be of two, as <hi>crible, pible, trible, title, 
títle, bible, bíble</hi>, the precept of Analogie or proportion will 
shew hereafter. If there seme another i, to follow next, the former of the 
two must be a y, as <hi>crying, denying</hi>, yea tho the primitiue end in the 
qualifyed i, as <hi>carie, marie, hurrie, currie, carying, tarying, hurrying, 
currying</hi>. where it is to be noted, that tho the primitiue word do end in 
y, yet the same y, in the former syllabs of the same words race in deriuation 
maie be the shrill i, onelesse another i, follow streight, as in <hi>supply, 
supplying,</hi> and yet <hi>supplied, denied</hi> be tolerable, tho the primitiue 
y, wold do well enough. If i, end a midle syllab, with a consonant or mo 
after, it followeth the flat ending sound, as <hi>coincident, imprinting</hi>. If 
it be a deriuatiue of a sharp primitiue, it soundeth sharp, and casteth his 
primitiue consonant ouer to the next syllab, as <hi>repine, requite, enquire, 
repineth, requiting, enquired</hi>, bycause a consonant cumming betwene two 
vowells in anie simple word must be spelled with the latter. Somtime the 
qualified consonant must kepe his own e, if the addition begin with a 
consonant, as <hi>entice, endite, enticement, <pb n="115"/>
enditement</hi>, which in <hi>enticing, enditing</hi> leaseth the e. bycause the 
addition beginneth with i. I, in the same proportion soundeth now sharp, as 
<hi>gíue, thríue, alíue, wíue, títle, bíble</hi>, 
now quik, as <hi>gìue, lìue, sìue, tìtle, bìble</hi>, 
which sounds ar to be distinguished by accent, if acquaintance will not seme 
in much reading: But this is a point, that the title of <hi>distinction</hi> hath 
taken to charge. The quik i, and the gentle passant e, ar so near of kin, as 
theie enterchange places with pardon, as in <hi>descryed</hi>, or <hi>descryd, 
findeth</hi>, or <hi>findith</hi>, <hi>hir</hi>, or <hi>her</hi>, the error is no 
heresie. 


</p>
               <p>I is vsed consonantlike, when it leadeth a vowell in the same syllab, as 
<hi>Iak, Iames, iolie, iump, ioy</hi>. Where note, tho the qualified, ge. as 
<hi>huge, rage, college</hi>, and this consonantish ie, be of som affinitie, that 
yet the i, tho with the e, after it cannot com in place of that ge, bycause 
that ge, euer followeth a vowell in the same syllab, as <hi>page, drudge, 
grudge</hi>, whereas the consonantish, i, still leadeth the sounding vowell, 
and beginneth the syllab. Againe e, after g. onelie qualifieth and neuer 
soundeth, as in <hi>reuenge, grange, bridge, tridge</hi>, and is the last letter 
of the word. E after i, the consonant, soundeth still, and is neuer the last, 
as <hi>iet, ieast</hi> bycause ie, in <hi>cherie, merie, carie, tarie</hi>, and such 
like, is i, the vowell qualifyed and quik. 


</p>
               <p>O 


</p>
               <p>O is a letter of as great vncertaintie in our tung, as e, is of direction both 
alone in vowell, and combined in diphthong. The cause is, for that in vowell 
it soundeth as much vpon the u, which is his cofin, as vpon the o, which is 
his naturall, as in <hi>còsen, dòsen, mòther</hi>, which o, is 
still naturallie short, and <hi>hósen, frósen, móther</hi>, 
which o, is naturallie long. In the diphthong it soundeth more vpon the u, 
then von the o, as in <hi>found, wound, cow, sow, bow, how, now,</hi> and 
<hi>bów, sów, wróught, oúght, mów, 
tróugh</hi>. Notwithstanding this varietie, yet our custom is so 
acquainted with the vse thereof, as it wilbe more difficultie to alter a 
known confusion, then profitable to bring in an vnknown reformation, in such 
an argument, where acquaintance <pb n="116"/>
makes iustice, and vse doth no man wrong. And yet where difference by note 
shall seme to be necessarie the titles of <hi>proportion &amp; distinction</hi>
will not omit the help. In the mean time thus much is to be noted of o: 
besides his time long and short, besides his tune with or without the 
qualifying e, sharp or flat, that when it is the last letter in the word, it 
soundeth sharp and loud, as <hi>agó, tó, só, nó</hi> saue 
in <hi>tò</hi> the preposition <hi>twò</hi> the numerall, <hi>dò</hi>
the verb: his compounds as <hi>vndò</hi>, his deriuatiues as 
<hi>dòing</hi>. In the midle syllabs, for tune, it is sharp, as here or flat 
if a consonant end the syllab after o. For time the polysyllab will bewraie 
it self in our dailie pronouncing: considering tho children and learners be 
ignorant, yet he is a verie simple teacher, that knoweth not the tuning of our 
ordinarie words, yea, tho theie be enfranchised, as <hi>ignorant, impudent, 
impotent</hi>. O varieth the sound in the same proportion, naie oftimes in 
the same letters, as <hi>lòue, glòue, dòue, shòue, 
remòue</hi> and <hi>lóue, gróue shróue, nóue</hi>. 
This duble sound of o, in the vowell is Latinish, where o, and u, be great 
cosens, as in <hi>voltus, voltis, colo</hi> And <hi>vultus, voltis, occulo</hi>: in 
the diphthong it is Grekish, for theie sound their <foreign xml:lang="el">ou</foreign>, still 
vpon the u, tho it be contract of oo, or <foreign xml:lang="el">os</foreign>, wherein as their 
president is our warrant against obiection in these, so must acquaintance be 
the mean to discern the duble force of this letter, where we finde it, and he 
that will learn out tung, must learn the writing of it to, being no more 
strange then other tungs be euen in the writing. 


</p>
               <p>V 


</p>
               <p>V besides the notes of his form, besides his time and tune, is to be noted 
also not to end anie English word, which if it did it should sound sharp, as 
<hi>mú, trú, vertú</hi>. But to auoid the nakednesse of the 
small u, in the end we vse to write those terminations with ew the 
diphthong, as <hi>new, trew, vertew</hi>. It is vsed consonantlike also as 
well as i, when it leadeth a sounding vowell in the same syllab, as 
<hi>vantage, reuiue, deliuer</hi> or the silent e, in the end, as <hi>beleue, 
reproue</hi>. This duble force of both i, and v, is set from the latin, and 
therefor it is neither the vncertaintie of our writing, nor the 
vnstedfastnesse of our tung, for to vse anie letter to a duble vse. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117"/>W 


</p>
               <p>The duble w, is a letter that hath accompanied our tung from the originall 
Germane, and is vsed somtime as a vowell, somtime as a consonant. It is 
neuer vowell but in the diphthongs as, <hi>draw, knew, throw</hi>, neither is 
it to enter the midle syllab of anie word, sauing in thre cases. The first 
whereof is, with the deriuatiues of those small diphthongs, as of <hi>know, 
knowing, knowledge, unknown</hi>. The second is, when <hi>custom</hi> will 
frame another primitiue after the proportion of one of these, as <hi>own</hi>, 
like <hi>unknown</hi>. The third is som manifest difference, where the single 
<hi>u</hi> might easilie be mistaken, and ioyned to the vowell following, as in 
<hi>vouell, couard</hi>, like <hi>houell, couert</hi>, and therefor, theie be to be 
written <hi>vowell, coward</hi>, with the duble w. W. is consonantish, when 
it leadeth a vowell in the same syllab, with either a consonant before it 
self, as in <hi>swine, swim, betwene</hi>, or it self the first as <hi>want, 
what, wrong</hi>, It is also consonantish in abbreuiations vpon like reason, 
as w, <note>w with little e above it </note> w <note>w with little t above 
it</note>. When it followeth a consonant, the latin enfranchisement vseth 
oftentimes the single u, as <hi>persuade, language</hi>, bycause the latins vse 
no double w: the English words kepe their naturall w, as <hi>twinge, 
swinge</hi>. Generallie the ending u, wold euer be the duble, as both the 
naturall form thereof, and the right vse thereof in the diphthongs do let vs 
vnderstand. 


</p>
               <p>Y 


</p>
               <p>Y, likewise is somtime consonantish, somtime vowellish. Consonantish, 
when it leadeth a vowell, as, <hi>yonder, young, yonker, beyond, that your, 
yard</hi>, both in abbreuiation &amp; without. 


</p>
               <p>Vowellish either to expresse <hi>Greke</hi> enfranchisements, as <hi>syllabs, 
polysyllabs, tyran</hi>: or English naturalls, which is in thre places. First 
when one i, followeth another immediatlie in the midle of a word, the 
former is to be expressed by a y, as <hi>replying, multiplying, denying, 
bying</hi>. Secondlie the shrill ending i, ought to be a y, as <hi>deny, aby, 
defy</hi> which y maie passe with them in their deriuation, as <hi>denyeth 
abying, defyance</hi>, tho where another i, followeth not, the shrill i, of it 
self maie suffise, as <hi>denied, defiance</hi>. Thirdlie, <hi>oi</hi>, the 
diphthong sounding vpon the o, for difference sake, from the other, which 
soundeth vpon the u, <pb n="118"/>
wold be written with a y, as <hi>ioy, anoy, toy, boy</hi>, whereas <hi>anoint, 
appoint, foil</hi>, and such seme to haue an u. And yet when, i, goeth before 
the diphthong, tho it sound vpon the u, it were better oy, then oi, as <hi>ioynt, 
ioyn</hi>, which theie shall soon perceiue, when theie mark the spede of 
their pen: likewise if oi with i, sound vpon the o, it maie be noted for 
difference from the other sound, with the streight accent, as <hi>boíe, 
eníoie</hi>. Hereby we find that y, in the natur of a consonant is mere 
English in the natur of a vowell a mungrell, half <hi>Greke</hi>, halfe English, 
to expresse those enfranchisments, which we borow of the<hi>Grekes</hi>, 
when we leaue som signe of their originall writing. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diphthongs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I called the diphthong a combination of vowells, whereof there be onelie 
twelue, and no mo nedefull for our English writing. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ai, decaie, ea, meat, oo, good, ou, about, 
au, audience, ei, streight, oi, anoint, ow, allow, 
aw, withdraw, ew, vertew, oy, enioy, uy, buy, iuyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the right vse of these twelue diphthongs there be thre speciall notes to 
be obserued. The first is, that those diphthongs, which ar writen with the 
single u, serue properlie for the former roomes, as, <hi>auditor, 
rebounding</hi>, and those, which haue the duble w, be peculiarlie to be vsed 
in the end, as, <hi>law, drew, auow</hi>. Which continew also with their 
compounds, and deriuatiues in the former syllabs, as, <hi>withdrawing, 
endewed, endowing, auoweth</hi>. If the duble w, in hir vowelish natur be 
found in anie former syllab, but vpon one of thre causes, which I noted in the 
duble w, it is a corruption, for all it be vsed. The second is, that of oi and 
oy, allredie noted in y. The third is, that of ou, and ow, alredie noted in o. If 
there be cause of distinction, that title shall dispatch that nede if the 
consideration ly in the writing, proportion will laie that certain. 


</p>
               <p>I se no cause why we should nede anie mo diphthongs or complexions of 
vowells, by whatsoeuer name, then these twelue. For oa, and ee, be helpt in 
our ordinarie writing by the qualifying e, as <hi>móne, bóne, 
cóte, lóte, bóte, quéne, séne, wéne 
betwéne</hi>. Neither is there anie duble e, to be vsed in our tung <pb n="119"/>
saue in the deriuatiues of those words, which end in the sharp e, as 
<hi>tré, trées, agré, agrées, sé, sées</hi> of 
which second e, we shall saie more in the title of deriuation, eo, is vsed in 
<hi>yeomen, people ieopard,</hi> and why not <hi>yemen, peple, iepard</hi>, as 
<hi>wemen steple, Ienkin</hi>, of the like analogie? Ai, is the mans diphthong 
&amp; soundeth full: ei, the womans, and soundeth finish in the same both 
sense, and vse, <hi>a woman is deintie, and feinteth soon, the man fainteth 
not bycause he is nothing daintie</hi>. This is enough to shew the force of 
the vowells and diphthongs, the titles that follow will shew their places 
and vse, as particular cause shall offer occasion. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the consonants</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>This is a generall note to be obserued in writing of all the consonants, that 
none of them is to be dubled, but where theie ar referred to diuerse syllabs, 
the former ending the former syllab, &amp; the latter beginning the next, as 
in <hi>bud-ding, strip-ped, buf-fet-ting, be gin-ning,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby it 
appeareth, that no consonant can be dubled in the end of a word, bycause 
there is no syllab to follow: and that therefor the dubling of the last syllab 
is mere ouersight. For if ye write <hi>putt</hi> with a duble, t, is not the 
syllab ended in the first <hi>put</hi>? and wherefor then serueth the latter, 
t? Some when theie haue dubled the consonant, will put an e to it, which is 
to make two syllabs, where theie mean but one, as <hi>putte</hi>: bycause of 
the rule, that the dubled consonants ar referred to diuerse syllabs. Why ll, 
&amp; ss, be dubled in the end contrarie to this rule, it shall be shewed in 
the handling of those letters. 


</p>
               <p>Where, by the waie it is to be noted, that the e passant after a duble ss, as 
in <hi>lessen</hi>, to make <hi>lesse</hi>, or a duble ll, as in <hi>fallen</hi>, &amp; 
such like, encreaseth no syllabs, and that therefor the duble ss, is not 
deuided, tho a vowell follow. 


</p>
               <p>B, is allwaie one in whatsoeuer place, as <hi>brabling, lubber, crab</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>C, is strong like to k, before a, o, u, either simple vowells, or combined in 
diphthongs, as <hi>cankard, cautele, concord, coward, cunning</hi>, or when it 
endeth a foresyllab before anie other consonant as c.q.k.t. as in <hi>succede, 
acquaint, acknowledge, expecting</hi>. C, is weak like, s, before e, &amp;, i, 
either alone or in diphthong, as <hi>cease, deceit, surcingle</hi>, or before the 
qualifying silent e, in the end, as <hi>acceptance, whence, once</hi>. 
<pb n="120"/>

               </p>
               <p>F, hath two forces, whereof the first is generall for the <hi>Greke</hi> ph, in 
whose place, we maie vse our f, still, if we will measur our writing by an 
English ear, as the <hi>Italians</hi> do in their writing, commonlie setting 
down, <hi>filosofie, ortografie,</hi> and such like with the latin f, as why 
not? For thereby we deliuer our peple, which know no foren learning, from 
seking of enfranchisments &amp; yet we leaue the learned, which know 
them, to the libertie of that, which theie know. The second force of f, is 
like to v, the consonant, which I vse to call cosens, bycause of their 
correspondence in change, as <hi>bereue, bereft, leaue lest, cleaue cleft</hi>. 
In <hi>if</hi>, and <hi>of</hi>, tho we se f, we here u, <hi>iue, oue</hi>, yet the 
aduerb of distance vseth the f, still, like ph, as <hi>I speak of him, which 
commeth afar of</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>G, is allwaie strong befor a.o.u. whether single vowells or in diphtongs as, 
gaie, gant, god, good, gout, gut, gulling. Likewise before r, or l, as <hi>graue, 
grant, glance, glew</hi>. And in the end of anie syllab, where the qualifying e 
followeth not, as in <hi>long, tung</hi>, onelesse the qualifying e, be left out, 
for som addition, which beginneth of a vowell, as, <hi>range, ranging, swinge, 
swinging</hi>, for in that place g, is weak. As it is also and allwaie before 
the qualifying e, as <hi>cage, huge, drudge, snudge, hedge, dodge</hi>. It is 
somtime strong, somtime weak before i, and e, contrarie to the latin, where 
it is allwaie weak before the same vowells, tho not contrarie to the 
<hi>Greke</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi>. This varietie of force before these two 
letters semeth to giue som matter to confusion in our writing. For as it is 
weak in these, gentle, ginger, gin, germain, and such: so is it strong in 
these, <hi>geld, gesse, gilt, begin, gìg, gét</hi> and such, and 
therefor no maruell if we write, college of <hi>collegium</hi>, and college of 
<hi>collega</hi>, with the same letters, seing our g is capable of both the 
forces before the same e. This necessarie distinction hereof shall appear in 
the title of distinction. But why do som vse to put an u, after the strong g, 
in som places, as in guise, guide, guest, beguile, and not write them all 
without the u, and with the g onelie, as girde, girth, girdle, getting? And 
why maie not these words be writen, gise, gest, gide, begile, as well as 
begin, beget, seing both our g, is strong before these vowells, and the 
difference noted, and g, with the u after is of another propertie in vse, as 
<hi>language, guise, Guichiardine, Guin, guerdon</hi>? I se no cause why, but 
that the u, <pb n="121"/>
maie well enough be left out. 


</p>
               <p>H, is an aspiration, whose force before all vowells and diphthongs is easie 
to be perceiued, as <hi>Henrie, hunter, haue, him, home, hauthorn, how, hew, 
hoídaie</hi>. Somtime it is writen, without anie force in vtterance, as 
in manie enfranchised words, as <hi>honest, humble, hoste, hostice</hi>. 
Where the vowell after h, is heard, as if there went no aspiration before. 
What force the h, is of after consonants in combusion, I will shew streight 
waie. 


</p>
               <p>K, serueth for the strong c, before e, and i, as in <hi>Kent, kitchin, kin, 
King</hi>. It goeth before no consonants but n, as <hi>knaue, knop</hi>, and l, 
with the e silent after, as <hi>pekle, pikle, trikle, cakle</hi>. Which ar to be 
writen with k, before the l, bycause the simples be <hi>pek, pik, trik</hi>. 
Whereby it appearth that the <hi>Greke</hi> ch, must of force be vsed in 
<hi>Christ, christian, christen</hi>, &amp;c. bycause k leadeth no mo 
consonants, but n, and l, with the silent, e. K followeth s, where c, wold be 
weak, as in <hi>skirmish, skirt, skrap</hi> otherwise c, as <hi>scape, scope, 
scour sculler</hi>. Where the same force is dubled, the former also must be 
k, if the simple end in k, <hi>quikker, thikker, thwakker, of, quik, thik, 
thwak</hi>, otherwise c, maie serue and supply the room. 


</p>
               <p>L, is still of one force in it self, as <hi>laudable, willing</hi>. Howbeit in 
respect of a, and o, going before it, and sounding like diphthongs it is dubled 
in the end of such words, as <hi>small, call, brall, boll, roll, troll</hi>. But 
when anie other consonant followeth l, the a and o sound still like 
diphthongs, and yet the l, is but single, as in <hi>falst, falt, malt, halt, cold, 
old, colt, dolt, rolf, bold, bolt</hi>. Hereupon, <hi>all</hi>, in composition 
before a naturall consonant, hath but a single l, as <hi>albeit, also, 
almost</hi>, otherwise a duble, as president of these two, <hi>all</hi>, and 
<hi>oll</hi>, maie not induce the dubling of allother terminations in l, as 
<hi>well, bell, shrill, still, full, scull</hi>, which dubling of the last ll, 
semeth most agreable both to reason and vse, where the vowells sound hard 
vpon the l, as it doth in these. But if the vowell sit not so hard, as in 
diphthongs, where the length of the vowells sound breaketh the force, that 
should light vpon the l, as in <hi>mail, fail, hail, recoil, foil</hi>, and such as, 
<hi>diuel, euil, riuel</hi>, why should the l, be dubled? It is the swiftnesse of 
the pen sure, which <pb n="122"/>
can hardlie staie vpon the single ending l, that causeth this dubling. 


</p>
               <p>M, and n, of themselues continew in the same force still, howbeit som 
negligence in writing giueth occasion of this note. That whereas both m, 
and n, be somtime signified by a title, that title, answereth the m, &amp; n, 
onelie, which endeth the syllab, and not the other, which beginneth, as in 
<hi>begin-ning, benum-med, som-mo-ning</hi>. And therefor that title, which 
will represent m, or n, aforegoing it mere false, &amp; ill abused. P, is euer 
one, ph, shalbe streight spoken of. 


</p>
               <p>Q. serueth onelie in the natur of k, or the strong c, to go before the single or 
duble w, both consonantlike in force, and indifferent in place, as <hi>quill, 
quail, acquaint, quince, squint, squall, squat, squese</hi>, or with the duble 
w, <hi>qwail acqwaint, qwik, qwince,</hi> saue where the enfranchisment 
requireth the single u, as in <hi>qualitie, quantitie, require, quintessence</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>S, besides the varietie noted to be in his form, somtimes forceth full like 
the weak, c, as in all beginnings of anie syllab, either before vowell, 
diphthong, or consonant, <hi>saie, seke, sift, soft, substance, sow, small, 
shrike, shrimp</hi>, somtime it yeildeth weaklie to the z, and that either 
betwene two vowells, as in <hi>wise, nose, amase, vse, excuse</hi>, or after 
one of the half vowells, l, m,n,r, <hi>wells, trims, hens, hirs</hi>, or after the 
e passant, as, <hi>times, rimes, games, names</hi>. Which sounds where theie 
com, <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>deriuation</hi> will bewraie: now theie ar to 
be distinguished in places of cause, the title of <hi>Distinction</hi> shall not 
forget. When the vowell sitteth hard vpon the s, in the end, s, is dubled 
frenchlike, as in <hi>passe, grasse, finesse, nedelesse, disinesse, blisse, 
grosse, crosse, discusse,</hi> if not, it is single, as in <hi>fines, nedles, 
promis, treatis, purpos, compas</hi> and such. Where custom vpon good 
reason, not vnproper to the sound, causeth the dubling. 


</p>
               <p>T, kepeth one force still sauing where a vowell followeth after, i, as in 
<hi>action, discretion, consumption</hi>, where as, t, soundeth like the full s, 
or strong c, so the words where it is so vsed, be altogether strangers. 


</p>
               <p>X, beginneth no English words, but endeth manie, as <hi>wax, vex, yex</hi>, and 
goeth into the midle of their deriuatiues, as <hi>waxing, vexeth, yexing</hi>, 
and with the qualifying e, <hi>iaxe</hi>, without <hi>ax, <pb n="123"/>
pax, wax</hi>. Which words be seuered from those that end in ks, bycause ks, 
endeth plurall numbers as <hi>pak, paks, rak, raks</hi>, whereas the singulars, 
or primitiues, haue in the plurall number and deriuatiues, es, or en, as 
<hi>fox, foxes, fixen, vexes, yexes, oxen, iaxes</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Z, is a consonant much heard amongst vs, and seldom sene. I think by reason 
it is not so redie to the pen as s, is, which is becom lieutenant generall to z, 
as gase, amase, rasur, where z, is heard, but s, sene. It is not lightlie 
expressed in English, sauing in foren enfranchisments, as <hi>azur, 
treasur</hi>. In the same proportion is s and <hi>as</hi>, is <hi>as</hi> strangelie 
vsed. 


</p>
               <p>The combination of consonants, which I called coplements be of two sorts, 
either consonants copled to them selues, as thw, in <hi>thwak</hi>, shr, in 
<hi>shrink</hi> stl, in <hi>whistle</hi>, &amp; such, which neuer change their 
force: or consonants with, h, the aspiration, as ch, gh, ph, ch, sh, th, wh. 
Whereof, gh, ph, ch, sh, wh, neuer change their force but continew still one, 
as <hi>cough, rough, philip, diphthong, rhetorik shame, shrewed, whence, 
which</hi>. Whereof ph, and th be <hi>Grecians</hi>, the rest English. 


</p>
               <p>Ch, forceth somtime strong like k, as in <hi>Christ, chrism, christian, chract, 
archangell, monarch, stomach</hi>, somtime weak, as in <hi>archdeacon, 
wretch, chirch</hi>, which semeth originallie to be of a duble k, <hi>kirk</hi>. 
Our English ch, commeth from the latin c, as, <hi>chaplain, chancellor, 
chaste,</hi> of <hi>capellanus, cancellarius, casta</hi> like the Italian force of 
c. 


</p>
               <p>Likewise, th, holdeth somtime stronglie, vpon the aspiration, as in <hi>thin, 
thik</hi>, somtime it yeildeth like a temporiser to a meaner weaknesse, as 
<hi>thine, thither</hi>. Neither, ch, nor th, hath anie e, after them, but when 
the vowell before is to be qualified in sound, as <hi>eche, beseche, beche, 
breche, ache, leche, speche, bathe, scathe, sithe</hi>, otherwise flat, without 
e, as <hi>sith, ech, bath</hi>. What prerogatiue in custom will ouerrule in 
these points, it shalbe noted in the titles of <hi>prerogatiue</hi> and 
<hi>proportion</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abbreuiations</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>W. and y, in their consonantish natur lead the most of our abbreuiations w 
<note> with little t above</note>, w<note>with little e above</note>, y 
<note>with little t above</note>, y <note>with little u above</note>, y 
<note>with little e above</note>, besides these and their fellowes the 
residew be bu verie few, as pronounce, perpetuitie, and som <pb n="124"/>
other few with the, m, or, n, titles. 


</p>
               <p>Thus much of rule both generall for the hole tung, and particular for the 
force of euerie letter, and charact, whether for the qualitie, or for the sound 
of our voice. Whereby methink that the greatest difficultie in our writing 
riseth about the vncertaine force of, i, and, o, the vowells, oi, oy, ou, ow, the 
diphthongs, c,g,s, the consonants, ch, and th, the coplements, all which shall 
be directed sufficientlie, in the title of <hi>distinction</hi>.

            <div xml:id="c1.18" type="chapter">
               <head>Of proportion.</head>
               <p>I Call that <hi>proportion</hi>, when a number of words, of like sound ar 
writen with the like sound haue not the like letters, the cause why is 
shewed, a in <hi>hear, fear, dear, gear, wear</hi>, the like <hi>proportion</hi> is 
kept: in <hi>where, here, there</hi> it faileth by <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, bycause 
our <hi>custom</hi>, hath won that writing in such aduerbs of place : in 
<hi>mere</hi> it faileth by <hi>enfranchisement</hi>, bycause it commeth of the 
latin <hi>merus, ra, rum</hi>. And therefore <hi>proportion</hi>, as all other 
rules, consisteth vpon generall precept and priuat exception. 


</p>
               <p>This rule of <hi>proportion</hi>, hath allwaie bene of great account, for 
directing of speche and pen, as theie that be learned in the matter of speche, 
and the writers of that argument, do know of themselues, without my 
alleging of anie Analogiarie autors of anie foren tung, Latin or other. And in 
the ordering of our tung, it serueth vs, as it were for another generall table. 
For as in the generall table, where euerie particular word is set down by 
order of the alphabete, we haue regard to the first letter, and thereby serue 
our own necessitie in case and cause of serch: so in the rule of 
<hi>proportion</hi>, where we set down all words of one sound, vnder one form 
of writing, with particular note when the <hi>proportion</hi>faileth, we 
regard that syllab which leadeth the <hi>proportion</hi>, and the vowell or 
dighthong <note>sic</note> in it, which giueth the life and sound to the 
syllab, and respect som multitude of words of one sort and sound, as in the 
alphabete we regard euerie particular, without eieing anie mo, then that, 
which we seke. All the words <pb n="125"/>
in our English tung com within the compas of proportion, vpon som occasion 
or other: either bycause there is none but it hath mo of the same sound, or 
but it maie haue mo in time, seing new occasions brede new words. Again, 
all the words which we vse in our tung, be either monosyllabs, that is but of 
one syllab, which be the most of our naturall English: or bisyllabs of two, 
whereof there be som certain English, &amp; as manie strangers: or 
polysyllabs, of mo then two, which be altogether enfraunchised, sauing som 
certain English deriuatiues or compounds, which fall not within this rule, 
bycause theie haue titles of their own. 


</p>
               <p>Wherefor considering our mere English words be mostwhat monosyllabs, I 
will deall with them first, then with the bisyllabs, last of al, with the 
polysyllabs, by order of the vowell or diphthong, which leadeth the syllab, 
&amp; therefor the proportion. I call that a syllab, which hath one sounding 
vowell in it, how manie consonants soeuer either go before or com after it, 
as, <hi>no, one, able, whistle, driuen, raken, thoughts, thrise, frok, shritch, 
strength, staruedst, frumpst</hi>. For the qualifying and silent e, encrease 
no syllabs, as neither the passant in most places, which shalbe noted 
hereafter. All which letters children wold be taught to spell togither, 
holding such a filling, e, as no sounder, to make a new syllab thereby, as 
<hi>har-den, wri-ten,</hi> for <hi>harden, writen</hi>, two syllabs by 
misspelling for, two monosyllabs in natur. 


</p>
               <p>Here by the waie the reader shall vnderstand that in this rule of 
<hi>proportion</hi> I will not medle with anie deriuatiue which coms of other, 
whether contract, as <hi>scratcht</hi>, of <hi>scratched</hi>, or plurall 
numbers, as <hi>matches</hi> of <hi>match</hi>, or anie such else, where the 
putting to of one letter or mo, doth cause the difference: sauing onelie 
where the deriuatiue in sense, semeth a primitiue in form, as the pluralls of 
<hi>man, mous, lous, foot, cow</hi>, be <hi>men, mice, lice, fete, kine</hi>, 
which form semeth rather to be originall, then deriued of anie other. 


</p>
               <p>A 


</p>
               <p>No English word endeth in, a, but in aie, as <hi>decaie, assaie</hi>, which 
writing &amp; sound our vse hath won. A, alone is the English article, <pb n="126"/>
which cometh generallie next before substantiues, as a <hi>mane, a 
man</hi>, oneless som adiectiue part them, as, <hi>a tall man, a long mane</hi>. 
This a ioyning with substantiues by waie of composition, so altereth their 
force, as theie signifie in dede, quite another thing. For when we saie, <hi>he 
cums apase, he goes aside, he looks aloft, he went along</hi>, we mean not 
the same, that we do in these speches, <hi>a swift pase, a sore side, a windie 
loft, a long waie</hi>. The president of this compound a, causeth vs oftimes 
to write foren words, with single consonants, which duble the same in their 
own tung as <hi>abbaie, abbandon, abbase, abbate</hi>: with one b, <hi>abaie, 
abandon, abase, abate</hi> bycause of their analogie &amp; proportion with 
<hi>a baie a bandie, a base, a bate</hi>, which be known English terms, &amp; 
being vttered quik bring furth the same sounds. Neither is it anie wonder 
that our tung vseth a single consonant, where the originall dubleth, as 
<hi>base,</hi> of <hi>bassus, pase,</hi> of <hi>passus</hi>. This, a, before vowells, 
diphthongs, and the aspiration h, is an, as <hi>an epistle, an auditour, an 
honest man</hi>. Where the question is, whether e, in ane be nedefull, 
considering in our speaking the, ne, semeth to ioyn with the vowell that 
followeth, according to that rule which teacheth vs, that a consonant 
cumming betwene two vowells must be spelled with the latter, as 
<hi>be-ne-fi-ci-all</hi> onelesse the words be compound, as <hi>an-o-ther, 
ab-o-lish</hi>, bycause then the simple syllab kepeth hir own combination still, as 
in the examples before. And bycause it semeth to be so in these words, 
<hi>an-other, an-hell, an-honest man</hi>, as if theie were but one word 
compounded of two, the qualifying e, doth seme nedelesse, as it is in those 
words, which be deriued from the qualified terminations, and begin their 
addition with som vowell, as <hi>praie, praing, amase, amasing, repute, 
reputing, depraue, depraueth</hi>, where the qualifying e, is left out, and the 
consonant before it is put to the next syllab. And semeth it not to be so in 
all those words, which end in the qualifying e, before another word 
beginning with a vowell, as <hi>mine own</hi>? 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blab, drab, grab, hab, nab</hi>, and with the qualifying e, <hi>babe, 
Băble, răble, brăble, dăble</hi>: and 
<hi>bāble, stāble āble, sāble</hi>, where I 
make the difference by the notes of the long and short time, not daring to 
duble the b, for making of two sllabs, by dubling the b, which maie not be 
here, the silent e, sounding <pb n="127"/>
not, and the words therefor for being monosyllabs, bycause there be not two 
sounding vowells or diphthongs, which are required in the making of two 
syllabs. 


</p>
               <p>C, alone endeth no syllab but with the qualifying e, after it, as <hi>ace, trace, 
race, face</hi>, which termination by ee, I take to be most naturall for this 
sound in our tung, both bycause manie enfranchised words haue the same 
end, as <hi>face, grace, space</hi>, and <hi>ase</hi>, with the s, and it is lightlie 
the termination of enfranchised words, <hi>case, pase, base</hi>, so it turneth 
verie much to the, z, as <hi>amase, rase, crase</hi>, whereas ace with the, c, 
soundeth still one like the naturall full, s. 


</p>
               <p>Monosyllabs, that is naturall English words of one syllab, seme to be writen 
with c, as the enfranchised polysyllabs be, <hi>tabernacle, barnacle, triacle, 
spectacle</hi>, but theie ar inded writen with, k, as <hi>hakle, cakle, takle, 
shakle</hi>, both bycause of ther primitiue <hi>hak, take, shake</hi>, and also 
bycause k, goeth before l, after a vowell, but not before, as in <hi>clamp, 
cling, clout</hi> where c, leadeth and not k. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Act, fact, contract</hi>, and such com from the Latin, and be therefor 
writen with ct. but <hi>bakt, pakt, thwakt, rakt, crakt</hi>, and such be 
English words contract <hi>bakt of bakked, pakt of pakked &amp;c.</hi> and be 
therefor writen with k, after their primitiue, hauing their a, short and quik, 
whereas <hi>nākte, bākte, rākte</hi>cumming of 
<hi>rake, nake, bake</hi>, ar to be writen with the qualifying e which kepeth 
the originall a, sharp. Som write <hi>bakt &amp;c.</hi> with c, before the k, 
but wrong, bycause c, cummeth not before k but when theie be to be referred 
to diuers syllabs, as <hi>ac-know-ledge</hi>, like <hi>accompanie</hi>, where 
the same consonant being dubled emporteth two syllabs. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ache, brache</hi>, with the qualifying e, for without the e, t, goeth before 
ch. as <hi>patch, snatch, catch, smatch, watch</hi>. The strong ch. is mere 
foren, and therefor endeth no word with vs, but it turned into k, as 
<hi>stomak, monark</hi> (whose originalls be <hi>stomach, monarch</hi> with 
ch. in the Greke.) <hi>Bad, swad, glad,</hi> and with e, <hi>glade, made, shade. 
Adle, cradle, ladle, stadle</hi> with <hi>a</hi> long: <hi>swadle, sadle, 
fadle</hi>, with <hi>a</hi> short, the single syllab admitting the distinction by 
time, and not by dubling the letter, for dubling the syllab withall. <hi>Badge, 
madge, fudge</hi>, where d, is necessarie bycause <pb n="128"/>
otherwise, <hi>a</hi>, wold sound long and sharp, as in <hi>page, age, 
rage, asswage</hi>. If e, followed not the, g, the, a, were flat, &amp; the, g, 
strong, as <hi>nag, bag, swag</hi>. In words of two or mo syllabs the, d, 
before, g, is not allwaie so nedefull, bycause the tung staieth not so sore 
vpon their last syllabs, as it doth vpon the monosyllab. <hi>Chaf, staf, graf, 
draf</hi>, and with, e, <hi>chafe, safe, rafe</hi>. <hi>Craft, shaft, graft, waft. 
Snafle</hi>, with a single, f, being but one syllab. <hi>Drag, brag, lag</hi>, and 
with, e, <hi>cage, wage, sage, age, pāgle</hi>with <hi>ā</hi>
long, <hi>drăgle</hi> with <hi>ă</hi>, short. <hi>Armagh, slagh, 
bagh</hi>, is a foren termination. <hi>Smak, pak, trak, crak</hi>, and with, e, 
<hi>take, rake, wake. akle</hi> was tuched before in <hi>acle</hi>. <hi>Ale, male, 
pale, dale</hi>, with the qualifying, e, is an ordinerie and a common 
termination, with vs. But where, a, in the end before a single, l, soundeth 
plane, al, I find none but certaine childish terms, as <hi>Mal</hi>for <hi>Marie, 
Lal, Dal</hi> &amp; som such. Bycause, a, in the end hath comonlie a duble, ll, 
after it, &amp; soundeth on the diphthong, as <hi>thrall, crall, wall</hi>, which 
it doth also before a single, l, when a consonant followeth next, as 
<hi>thraldom, walking. Shall</hi>, our common term soundeth not vpon the 
diphthong, and yet for companie sake will haue a duble, ll, whose force, that 
it is not diphthonglike, it appeareth in the deriuatiue, l, cumming before, t, 
&amp; not sounding in <hi>shalt</hi>, as in <hi>malt, halt</hi>. <hi>Alb</hi>. which 
in our ordinarie speche we sound <hi>aub</hi>, turning the, l, into, u, and so we 
entertain, l, generallie before most of our consonants. For tho we write 
<hi>calm, balm, talk, walk, chalk, calf, calues, salues</hi>: yet we pronounce 
them so as if theie had no, l, but onelie the duble, w or single, <hi>cawm, 
bawm, taulk, waulk, chauk, caulf, cawnes fawnes</hi>. <hi>Ald</hi>. is the 
comon termination of participles contract, as <hi>cald</hi>, for <hi>called 
apald</hi>, for <hi>apalled, gald</hi>, for <hi>galled</hi>. Yet som few there be of 
that ending, which ar mere originalls, as <hi>scald, bald, ald. Calf, half, 
walk, talk, calm, shalm, palm, faln</hi>, a contract for <hi>fallen, yalp, scalp, 
false, halse</hi>, with the silent, e, which is familiar to the enfranchised 
words and their followers. <hi>Malt, salt, falt, salue, salues, calf, 
calues</hi>, the, f, still bewraying his kinred with v, the consonant. <hi>Dram, 
cram, dam</hi>, and with, e <hi>dame, name, shame, blame. Ankle, shamble, 
scramble, scamble. Cramp, stamp, lamp. Ample, strample. Lamb.</hi> And 
why not <hi>lam</hi>, as <hi>Lammasse, daie</hi>? and not <hi>lambmasse</hi>, 
with the b? <hi>Chams, champs, lamps,</hi> deriuatiues. <pb n="129"/>
                  <hi>Man, can, bran</hi>. And with the qualifying, e, <hi>mane, cane, 
brane. Glance, france, chance</hi>. Where, a, before the, n, soundeth like a 
diphthong, tho, u, be not to be writen. <hi>Ancle, rancle</hi>, and why not 
<hi>ankle, rankle</hi>, seing <hi>rank</hi>is a simple? <hi>Hanch, stanch, panch. 
Brand, hand, sand. Handle, dandle, candle, rang, bang, swang</hi>and with the 
qualifying, e, <hi>range, grange, strange, wrangle, strangle, angle, frank, 
crank, rank, bank, scant, pant. Scantle, scantling.</hi> I vse no example of 
anie combination with, re, bycause I take it better to end in er, as 
<hi>falter</hi>, rather then <hi>faltre &amp;c. Scrap, lap, hap, clap, rap</hi>, 
&amp; with, e, <hi>ape, rape, scape, tape. Māple, stāple</hi>, 
with the a long, <hi>ăple, grăble</hi>, with the a, short. 
<hi>apt</hi> is an originall stranger, our words in <hi>apt</hi> be deriuatiues, as 
<hi>hapt, trapt, capt, flapt</hi>, for <hi>happed, trapped, capped, flapped</hi>. 
<hi>Iaques</hi> for <hi>Iakes</hi> the, e, passant falling vpon the, s, is an 
enfranchised word. We vse not, q, in the end, but still in the beginning of a 
syllab, bycause, u, followeth him of necessitie, as <hi>quagmire, quilt, 
require, squint. War, far, car</hi> and with the qualifying e, <hi>ware, fare, 
care</hi>. <hi>marble, garble, warble. Sparcle</hi>, and why not <hi>sparkle</hi>
bycause of <hi>spark</hi>? <hi>Sarce, parce</hi>, with the shrill and long 
ā <hi>farse, arse</hi>, with the short and flat a, e, cumming in, not as 
a qualifier, but as incident to the long, s. by natur of enfranchisement. 
<hi>Arch, parch, starch. Hard, mard. Scarde, larde, garde, warde</hi>, with the

<hi>tarte, parte, darte. startle, starue, swarue, carue.</hi>. <hi>As</hi> and 
<hi>was</hi> sound as oft vpon the, z, as vpon the strong, s, and therefor the 
duble ss, with the silent e, is vsed in our tung to expresse the vowell which 
sitteth hard vpon the, s, as <hi>passe, glasse, grasse</hi>. Whose dubling, as

               <p>What e, soundeth in the end, when there be no mo vowells in the syllab, then

the polysyllabs enfranchised kepe their originall, as <hi>priuilege,

euer vowellish, &amp; neuer consonant, like the weak ge: tho in the

thorough all these monosyllab terminations, bycause I find the like don in 
other tungs, which vse to rip vp all, thereby to find assurance, wherewith to 
rule all. This being thus ended concerning the monosyllabs, I must saie 
somwhat also of the <hi>bisyllabs &amp; polysyllabs</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proportion of bisyllabs</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>I call that a bisyllab, wherein there be two seuerall sounding vowells, as 
<hi>Asùr, rasùr, masùr</hi>, and why not <hi>lasur? farow, 
borough, thorough. Writing. biting.</hi> the proportion in this kinde also is 
verie commodious, bycause when ye haue found out one certaine head all of 
the like sound maie be easilie reduced thereunto, onelesse som prerogatiue 
of priuat <hi>custom</hi>, or som respect to the originall stranger do 
interrupt the rank. If there be but one word in anie kinde, that one will 
serue for a gide, when anie mo afterward shall craue the help of the like 
conduct, as <hi>Whisper, hussard</hi>. If there be no president of the same 
sound, yet the like proportion in som other vowell, will lead his cosen 
sound, as if there were no such word as <hi>badger</hi>, yet <hi>hedger</hi>, 
wold lead vs to the like writing. Wherein I haue regard still to the English 
ear, reseruing the writing of enfranchised words in their own colours, to 
such as be skilfull. I will write for the common man, <hi>Aumner, 
aumrie</hi>, naie euen <hi>filo sofie</hi>, and <hi>ortografie</hi>, and leaue 
<hi>Almoner, almonarie</hi> naie <hi>Eleemosyner, &amp; Eleemosynarie, 
philosophie</hi> and <hi>ortographie</hi>, to the discretion, <pb n="138"/>
of such, as be learned, to vse or refuse as theie list. Wherein I follow the 
autoritie of a great master in speche, euen <hi>Tullie</hi> him self, who 
reseruing the misterie of speche and pen to himself and his peres, did lend 
the peple, the vse and customarie thereof. Now these bisyllabs, be either 
naturall English as <hi>bauin, crauin, rauin</hi>, or enfranchised foren, as 
<hi>Pallet, mallet, ballet.</hi> And again in both the kindes theie be either 
simple, as <hi>canell, panell, chanell</hi>, or compound, as <hi>waieward, 
toward, froward, aside, asquint, astraie, except, reiect, conceiue, 
detaine</hi>. As for the compounds and enfranchisments theie haue the help 
of particular titles to direct them: for the simples and naturall English I am 
to deall in this place. Whereof I will set down but certain generall notes, 
bycause the table which followeth, shal contain so manie of ech sort, as I 
can well remember, and euerie one of them so proportioned to my note in 
rule, as theie shall one answer another thoroughlie, as <hi>Cancel, chancell, 
hancell. Chalice, malice, Calice, amice, office. Lauer, fauer, sauer. 
Iaueling, graueling, shaueling, raueling. Natur, statur, Measur, treasur</hi>. 
But I shall not nede to vse anie further enumeration, seing the endings be all 
one, and the former syllab is that which moueth matter of question in this 
place, which hath verie manie helps hereafter, whereby it maie be 
thoroughlie vnderstood: deriuation somtime breading bisyllabs, as of 
<hi>time, timelie, witie,</hi> of <hi>wit, writer</hi> of <hi>write</hi>, 
composition somtime, as <hi>breakfast, thraldom, vauntgard lastage, 
pondage</hi>, enfranchisment somtime, as <hi>Excuse, abuse, abase, reiect</hi>
distinction somtime noting, them, as <hi>Amis</hi>, and <hi>amisse, ascent, 
assent, desert</hi>, and <hi>desért</hi>, and what not? Therefor the 
bisyllabs for this place shall content themselues with these few notes. 
First that the silent, e, after, l, encreaseth not the number of syllabs, &amp; 
that therefor <hi>Brable, scrăble, strample, wrangle, circle, whistle, 
gogle, trouble,</hi> &amp; number such be but monosyllabs. <hi>Barnacle, 
triacle, chronicle, tunicle</hi>, &amp; manie such be but bisyllabs. 
<hi>Agreable, auailable, penetrable</hi> &amp; a number, such be but of thre 
syllabs. Again, that the, e, passant in such words, as <hi>basten, writen, 
biden,threaten, frosen, cosen</hi> &amp; such encreaseth not the syllabs, 
&amp; that therefor these, which I haue rehersed &amp; such other be but 
mere monosyllabs. <hi>Abiden, forgoten, unwriten</hi>, &amp; such but 
bisyllabs. Again, that the English tung is not lengthned <pb n="139"/>
eueriewhere for position, &amp; concourse of two or mo consonants, and 
that therefor, the quikker time mostwhat dubleth the consonant in bisyllabs, 
as <hi>Fallow, sallow, yallow, tallow, smallow. matter, platter, batter. 
Mărie, tărie, cărie, quărie</hi>, with the shorte 
time. <hi>Mārie, chārie, fārie</hi>, with the long 
time, tho in neither the consonant be dubled. That both in bisyllabs, and 
polysyllabs tho the same writing be in the end which is in the monosyllab, 
yet the sound is far quikker, as in either of them the ending, <hi>ow</hi>, 
runneth but like a single, u, whereas in the monosyllab, it wilbe heard full, 
as in <hi>Low, know</hi>, and <hi>bellow, mellow, yallow</hi>, the difference is 
sene. As concerning polysyllabs, theie be either English compounds or foren 
Enfranchisments, which will bewraie themselues in their own places, the 
simple words bringing their hole furniture in composition, as, <hi>ouerseing, 
vndoing, whereupon, eueriewhere</hi>. And the foreners euer appealing to 
their originall grounds, euen when theie be most fashioned to the English 
ear, as <hi>originall,</hi> to <hi>originalis, enfranchisment, chastisment</hi> to 
their own cuntries. And therefor I do not entend to saie much of them in 
this place, otherwise then by generall note, bycause both the common table, 
and all the titles that follow concern bisyllabs, and polysyllabs most: as 
the generall rule, and the first part of proportion do most concern 
monosyllabs. In which monosyllabs the naturall force of euerie letter is 
best perceiued, bycase the sound and strength thereof appeareth there 
fullest, where these is none to participat with them in sound, but 
themselues, which cannot be sene so well in words of mo syllabs, bycause 
theie hudle on euerie sound with more quiknesse, saue where the time or 
tune will command verie roundlie. The polysyllab therefor for the chefe girk 
of his sound riseth vpon the third syllab from the end, as the bisyllab doth 
of the second. And bycause the large doth alwaie comprise the lesse within 
it, therefor the rules of the first &amp; second syllabs, hold in the 
polysyllabs, where the companie of mo syllabs causeth anie one to be the 
lest noted: onelesse som speciall occasion for difference sake make the 
verie last, or the last saue one to be thought on and noted, as in 
<hi>conc&amp;obreverdance, surfitting, grasseh&amp;obrevepper</hi> and such, the 
second syllab short is a propertie of our tung contrarie to the common rule 
of time, tho not <pb n="140"/>
to the rule of tune. (For the <hi>Grekes</hi> do so in the like positions) and 
therefor causeth the last syllabs saue one in these words &amp; in the like 
to be better noted. Again, in <hi>aburing, adiuring, coniuring, periurie</hi>, the 
ods in the midle time maketh the deriuatiues of the same primitiues to be 
markt for that syllab. And again, <hi>on</hi>, in the simple monosyllab, naie 
euen in the bisyllab soundeth vpon the, o, most, in the polysyllab vpon the, u, 
bycause the enfranchising of such words, as <hi>circumscription, deuision, 
partition, comparison, declineson</hi>, kepeth the naturall, o, but giueth it 
the enfranchisers, dy, in, <hi>u</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>But to knit vp this title of <hi>proportion</hi>, (which is the great master 
leader to all our whole tung, as <hi>Rule</hi> is the great anatomist of all the 
sounds and forces of our letters) when we haue don all that either 
<hi>sound</hi> maie require, or <hi>reason</hi> can enioyn, <hi>custom</hi> will 
haue a great stroke, and must make vp the trinitie in direction of speche. 
For what but <hi>custom</hi> hath won, in <hi>nation, deriuation, deliberation, 
inclination</hi>, to kepe a, still, and to go so near the originall: and in 
<hi>declinson, comparison, aduowson</hi>, and such to go so much astraie from 
the originall, <hi>declination, comparation, aduocation</hi>? Wherefor as 
<hi>sound</hi> hath somwhat to saie in our ortographie, and <hi>reason</hi> not 
nothing, so the <hi>custom</hi> of our cuntrie will try mastries for hir 
interest, which she must haue at his hand who so entendeth to handle this 
argument with liking, as who so douteth to write a word in English, must 
seke out the like sound in proportion.

euerie one being limited by <hi>proportion</hi>, the next point in naturall 
method is to examin, whether the words, whose force is this, and roum is 
thus, be simple but for pure syllabs, or compound of mo words. For the bare 
word, which is handled in <hi>proportion</hi>, is somtime set down by it self 
without further addition of anie either significant word, or not significant 
particle, as <hi>after, doom, kin</hi>. Somtime it hath one or mo significant 
words ioyned vnto it, which yet in dede make but <pb n="141"/>
one word, when theie ar so linked, howsoeuer theie signify in their seueral 
vses, as <hi>Afterdeal, whereabout, howsoeuer, doomsdaie, kinsman</hi>, 
somtime it hath som more put to it, tho that, which is put to, being set 
alone signify nothing, and yet in the addition alter the signification of the 
originall word, as <hi>Finenesse, thraldom, firerie, desirous, kings, woes, 
agreith, sees, witches</hi>. Of these thre kindes the first is dispatcht in 
<hi>proportion</hi>, the last hath a proper title of <hi>deriuation</hi>, the midle 
and <hi>compound</hi> is to be handled is this place. 


</p>
               <p>Therefor that word is called <hi>compound</hi>, which is made of two or mo 
simple words, whereof euerie one signifyeth somwhat agreable to the 
composition, euen when theie ar vsed alone, if theie be euer vsed all alone. 
For, as <hi>catchpoll, chirchyard, outlaw</hi>, signify by their particular 
words vsed alone, so <hi>beched, gainstand, awry, vnbind</hi>, be made of two 
words, whereof the former thre <hi>be, gain, a</hi>, be neuer vsed alone in 
anie such such sense, as theie imply in their composition, the last, 
<hi>vn</hi>, is neuer vsed at all alone and answereth the Latin priuation, 
<hi>in</hi>as <hi>indoctus</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Now these <hi>compound</hi> words be either mere English, or clear strangers: 
mere English as when theie &amp; theie &amp; their parcells be altogither 
English words, as <hi>comecase, headstall, headman, cupbord</hi>. Clear 
strangers, when their substance is mere foren, tho their liuerie be English 
for som maner of their writing and vtterance, squared to our sounds in the 
like <hi>proportion</hi>, as <hi>presuppose, infringe, circumstance, ortografie, 
filosofie</hi>. Ye shall somtime haue a word mungrell <hi>compound</hi>, half 
foren, half English. <hi>Headlong, wharfage, princelike</hi>. The knowledge of 
composition is verie necessarie for the right writing of our tung manie 
waies. 


</p>
               <p>First bycause the <hi>compound</hi> lightie bringeth in his single partes with 
all their letters, as <hi>fearefull, neuerehelesse, harebraine, carefull, 
carfull</hi>. Saue where some necessarie cause either putteth in som letter, 
or putteth out som, or changeth som, or misplaceth som, as in <hi>kinsman, 
kingstand</hi>, s, is added to bewraie som qualitie possessionlike. In 
<hi>wilfull, husband, partaker, pastime</hi>. The single, l, and, s, in <hi>will, 
&amp; passe</hi>, do serue before a consonant in <hi>composition</hi> and 
<hi>sound</hi>, as strong as the duble doth in the simple word. Again in 
<hi>husband</hi>, the verie smoothnesse of the word, putteth out, o, in 
<hi>ow</hi>, and the, e, after, s, and <pb n="142"/>
changeth the duble, w, into the single: In <hi>partaker</hi>, one, t, is common 
to both the simples in <hi>composition, part</hi>, and <hi>taker</hi>, and is 
spelled with the latter, a point of great vse in our right writing, for not 
dubling common letters. Generallie here is to be noted, that there is no 
figur lakking in our words, which is receiued in the learned tungs, and ar by 
them called <hi>metaplasms</hi>, or alterations of the words form and fauor. 
Bycause the finer English peple vse to pronounce their words with a 
delicacie euen comparable to the gallant speches, which delicacie being set 
down in writing, sheweth the vse of those <hi>metaplasms</hi>, to be no lesse 
in ours, then it was in theirs. 


</p>
               <p>Secondlie we ar oftimes enforced to break our words in the latter end of our 
lines, and to write out that in the beginning of the next line, which we left 
vnwritten in the former. For tho it be said of <hi>Augustus Cæsar</hi>, that 
he vsed to write the remnant of his word in the end, vnder the same line 
with a croked stroke about it, yet it is handsomer to write it in the next 
line, bycause we vse not <hi>Augustus Cæsar</hi>, for an example in learning 
tho we do it in gouernment. Wherefor it is good to know not onelie how 
manie letters go to a syllab in euerie simple and vncompound word, but also 
which be the full partes of euerie <hi>compound</hi>, that the hole words in 
<hi>composition</hi>maie be deuided togither, as all the letters of one syllab 
ar to go togither, as in <hi>cramp-ring</hi>, not <hi>cram-pring</hi>, in 
<hi>dis-honest</hi>, like <hi>dish-clout</hi>, in <hi>as-well</hi>, not <hi>a-swell</hi>, in 
<hi>as-much</hi>, not <hi>a-smuch</hi>, Which consideration tucheth not onelie 
such as write, but also such as spell out of writing, bycause those letters ar 
to be spelled togither which ar to be writen togither. 


</p>
               <p>Thirdlie the knowledge of composition is good to discern the difference of 
meaning, which is to be expressed in writing. For when the same words be 
so placed, as theie maie be constrewed simply or ioyntly theie brede the 
fallax, which is called the error by deuiding those words, which ar to be 
vnited, or by vniting those which ar to be deuided, as <hi>a-wry, a-waie, 
be-long, begin</hi>, &amp; such other, haue great diuersitie in their force being 
<hi>compound</hi> from that which theie haue when theie be single. Fourthlie 
the composition verie oftentimes altereth the quantitie &amp; tuning of the 
words as <hi>showmăker &amp; partāker</hi>, be not of the 
same tuning <pb n="143"/>
and yet <hi>māker</hi>, and <hi>tāker</hi> be. Likewise 
<hi>soothsăier, neuerth&amp;ebrevelesse, forăsmuch</hi>. 
Wherefor so necessarie a point deserueth the knowledge. 


</p>
               <p>Fiftlie <hi>composition</hi> must be well considered for two other speciall 
points, both in writing and spelling, besides these, bycause it shaketh two 
generall rules in spelling and so consequentlie in breaking of the syllabs. 
Whereof the first is, that if a consonant com betwene two vowells, it is to 
be spelled with the latter, as in <hi>me-mo-rie, se-di-ti-ous</hi>. The second 
is, that those consonants must be spelled togither, which maie begin a word 
in the same combination, as <hi>be-smear</hi>, bycause we saie <hi>smart, 
smatch</hi>. Now <hi>composition</hi>, breaketh both these rules, for against 
the first it will saie, <hi>red-olent, ab-olish</hi>. And against the second it 
will saie. <hi>Trans-pose</hi>, not <hi>tran-spose</hi>, tho we saie <hi>spent, 
spoun</hi>, bycause in distribution, which spelling doth imply, euerie parcell 
must haue his own letter. 


</p>
               <p>Now as the knowledge of composition, is verie necessarie for the right 
writing of our tung, vpon these and such other considerations, so it is no 
hard thing to com by, bycause neither the naturall English compounds, nor 
yet the enfranchised stranger do offer anie difficultie in their knowing. For 
the generall table which followeth conteining all our simple words either 
there named, or by their proportion to be easilie reclamed to the same 
cadence, when soeuer two or mo of those simples go into one, it will saie it 
self, that this word is a compound, which maie easilie be proued by 
comparing the compound with the simples, if anie be so simple, that he 
cannot discern a compound which bringeth all his simples with their own 
letters, without the help of a table. <hi>Farewell, warfare, waiward, 
toward</hi>, be compounds, whose simples be, <hi>fare, war, well, waie,</hi>
or <hi>awaie, ward, to</hi>, and ar to be found in the table. 


</p>
               <p>As for the foren compositions theie be enfranchised hole, &amp; be also 
most of them in the table, tho with som English hew, yet so as their 
strangership maie appear. And such as be compounded with the latin 
prepositions, haue them also clear most what. Which latin prepositions 
when we vse before our words, we fashion them to clasp with our letters 
following, as the Latins do in the like cause, as <hi>displease, disease, 
disworship, complain, <pb n="144"/>
contein. Affaires, afford. Incom</hi>. Howbeit we vse their pewfellowes, 
which answer to them in our tung commonlie after the words: As <hi>go 
before, com behind, sit beneath, speak of, run from , stand betwene</hi>. The 
foren prepositions be generallie known to euerie childe in euerie Accidence. 
Our chefe prepositions, and those not significant, but in <hi>composition</hi>
be these. A, as, <hi>ago, agre, ado, abide, aswash</hi>. Be, as <hi>besmutched, 
bespit, bethump, behead, betake</hi>. For, as <hi>forthink, forfet, forshow, 
forsake</hi>. Fore, as <hi>forecast, forestall, foretell</hi>. Gain, as 
<hi>gainsaie, gainstand</hi>. Mis, as <hi>misdemeanor, misuse, mishap</hi>. Vn, 
as <hi>unkinde, unfrind, untrew, unpleasant, unthrift</hi>. Thus much 
concerning <hi>composition</hi>, which I take to be a verie necessarie 
instrument for vs to vse, in the finding out of our right writing, bycause it 
bringeth in the simple English words hole, without anie either losse or 
increase, or other metamorphosis, then vpon such allowable causes, as I 
haue alledged: &amp; as for strangers enfranchised, it bringeth them in so 
hole, as the originall is soon bewraied, tho theie lean somwhat to the 
English shore for their denisonship.

               <head>Of Deriuation.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deriuation</hi> naturally succedeth composition. For as composition 
handleth the coplements of seuerall hole words which by their vniting make 
a new one: so <hi>deriuation</hi> handleth the coplements of one hole word, 
and som addition put to it, which addition of it selfe, signifieth nothing 
alone, but being put to the hole word qualifyeth it to som other vse, then the 
primitiue was put to, as <hi>frind</hi>, being a primitiue receiueth manie 
additions, which yet signify nothing in the sense of their addition, tho theie 
change the force of <hi>frind</hi>, as <hi>frindship, frindlie, frindlinesse, 
frinds, frindeth, frinded, frinding, frindedst</hi>, &amp;c. For I do not entend 
to deall with anie point of <hi>deriuation</hi> in this place, but where the 
right writing maie com in question, which is in addition onelie, either 
direct, or contract, which contraction shorteneth the word vpon cause, that 
is to be resolued to the originall, as <hi>monthlie</hi>, for <hi>monethlie, 
cifring,</hi> for <hi>cifering, learnd</hi>, for <hi>learned, children</hi>, for 
<hi>childeren, past</hi>, for <hi>passed</hi>. A figur <pb n="145"/>
of great and common vse in our tung, euen where it is not perceiued but 
to the verie curious obseruer. 


</p>
               <p>The <hi>diminutiues</hi>, with vs enlarg not, but as in sense theie lessen the 
thing, so in speche theie shorten the word, and cut of the primitiue length; 
&amp; therefor I hold them among primitiues for their first term, tho for 
som accidentarie points, which shalbe noted hereafter, theie fall within 
compasse of this title, as by <hi>diminution</hi> we call <hi>Iohn, Iak, Richard, 
Dic, Ione, Iug, Barptholomew, Bat, Christofer, Kit, Elisabeth, Besse, 
Catherin, Cate</hi>. Which <hi>deriuations</hi> in respect of som plurall 
numbers &amp; possessiues, ar subiect to the rule of such words, as be of 
like cadence. <hi>Pak, pik, dug, rat, fit, chesse, pate</hi>, but of themselues 
theie be proportionate originalls. 


</p>
               <p>Wherefor I define that word to be a <hi>deriuatiue</hi> in this place which 
altereth from the primitiue or first head, by som addition, which addition of 
it self signifieth nothing alone, tho in addition it qualify the primitiue to 
som other vse, then it is of it self, as <hi>God, godlie, godhead, good, goodlie, 
goodnesse, wasp, waspish, fellow, fellowship, fine, finenesse, win, winning, 
pine, pineth</hi>, &amp;c. All <hi>deriuatiues</hi> be either English, as 
<hi>heauinesse, woddish, wisest, wittie</hi>: or theie be strangers 
enfranchised, as <hi>temperance, continencie, argument, admonition</hi>. As 
for the stranger enfranchised <hi>deriuatiues</hi>, the tide of enfranchisment 
will examin them, besides that the generall table will set them furth plane, 
bycause theie be transported vnto vs holelie, tho with som English habit, as 
the conusance of their enfranchising. 


</p>
               <p>The English <hi>deriuatiues</hi> be either perfit, when the vowell of the 
primitiue is not clipt awaie by the addition, as in <hi>holelie, worthienesse, 
cosinage, singlelie, simplelie</hi>: or vnperfit, when it is, as in <hi>fine, 
fining, dare, daring, carie, carying</hi>. Again, all our English 
<hi>deriuatiues</hi> be either <hi>substantiarie</hi>, or <hi>accidentarie</hi>. I 
call those <hi>deriuatiues</hi> sustantiarie, which tho theie do com of som 
other, yet thei themselues serue again for heads to other, such as the 
grammarians in our learned tungs cal <hi>possessiues, localls, materialls, 
aduerbialls</hi>, &amp;c. As <hi>tré, treén, upland, uplandish, war, 
warrious, warlike, martiall, martialist, vertew, vertewous, vertewouslie, 
England, English</hi>, &amp;c. I call those accidentarie <hi>deriuatiues</hi>, 
which concern numbers tenses, persons, and such properties as <pb n="146"/>
we call accidents in the learned handling of such words, as <hi>wo, woes, cry, 
cryes, word, words, fish, fishes, tre, trees, agré, agrees, write, 
writen, wrate, wrote, writeth, wrotest, writest, scrible, scriblest</hi>, 
contract for <hi>scribledest, hadst</hi>, contract for <hi>haueddest</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>I shall not nede to stand much vpon prouf, that <hi>deriuation</hi> is a verie 
nedefull instrument, for the furtherance of our right writing, considering 
the thing it self, being set down doth infer the profit therewithall, euen to 
euerie mans sense, which is willing to se it. Wherefor leauing the 
profitablenesse thereof to their iudgement, which shall proue it, I will first 
handle the <hi>Sustantiarie</hi>, and then the <hi>accidentarie deriuations</hi>, 
which both ar much bound to the rule of proportion, bycause their 
<hi>deriuatiue</hi> addition claspeth with the cadence and end of the pure 
originall. For the better performance whereof this is to be noted that euerie 
deriuable word endeth either in a vowell or in a consonant. As for the 
consonant ending, the addition to it is allwaie one. In the vowellish ending, 
there is more varietie, bycause the end thereof is somtime in a single 
vowell, somtime in a diphthong, and the single vowell is somtime silent, 
somtime sounding, all which giue cause of obseruation in the putting to of 
the additions, as shall appear when the additions be known, which somtime 
bring furth adiectiues, somtime substantiues, somtime different numbers, 
somtime different persons. The <hi>deriuate</hi> substantiue terminations be 
commonlie these, nesse, as <hi>madnesse</hi>, shipe, as <hi>workmanship</hi>, 
age, as <hi>cosinage</hi>, dom, as <hi>fredom, kingdom</hi>, th, as <hi>length, 
strength, welth, helth, truth</hi>, let, as <hi>chaplet</hi>, hood, as 
<hi>womanhood,</hi> rie as <hi>knauerie</hi>, all, as <hi>refusall, denyall</hi>, 
ance, as <hi>defiance</hi>, ing, as <hi>chambring</hi>, tie, as <hi>frailtie</hi>, 
onelesse that com of the enfranchised substantiues, ment, as 
<hi>punishment</hi>, yer, as <hi>lawyer</hi>, er, as <hi>writer</hi>, our, as 
<hi>demeanour</hi>. The <hi>deriuate</hi> adiectiue terminations be commonlie 
these, lie, as <hi>fatherlie, monthlie, wiselie</hi>, an, as <hi>Italian, Grecian, 
Roman</hi>, ish, as <hi>Scotish, campish, kentish</hi>, where the single 
possessiues, s, as <hi>Kings, Quenes, mothers</hi>. Neither do I se anie cause 
were to vse <hi>his</hi>, sauing after words which end in s, as <hi>Socrates his 
councell was this, Platoes that, Aristotels this,</hi> er, as <hi>wiser</hi>, <pb n="147"/>
est, as <hi>wisest</hi>, ing, as <hi>louing</hi>, ed, as <hi>loued</hi>, ght, 
as <hi>taught, thought</hi>, en, as <hi>writen, threaten, slain</hi>, contract for 
<hi>slaien, ashen, oken, birchen</hi>, the first participalls,the second 
materialls, ous, as <hi>vertewous</hi>. The <hi>deriuatiue</hi> number 
terminations, <hi>es, s, n,</hi> as <hi>muses, wiues, words, tops, oxen, 
howsen</hi>. The <hi>deriuatiue</hi> person terminations, est, as <hi>louest</hi>, 
eth, as <hi>loueth</hi>, ith, as <hi>seith</hi>. Which is when the simple endeth 
in the sharp, e, which maie not be extinguished, as the silent is in <hi>thriue, 
thriueth, wiueth</hi>, edst, as <hi>louedst</hi>. Now all these additions ar to 
be measured according to the ending of those words whereunto theie clasp, 
&amp; be allwaie one, but where contraction shortneth them, and allwaie 
hole but for the silent, e, which is somtime drouned, when the addition 
beginneth with a vowell. The sustantiue and adiectiue terminations serue 
for those <hi>deriuations</hi>, which I call <hi>substantiarie</hi>, the number 
and person, terminations for the <hi>accidentarie</hi>. In both which these 
notes take place, first if it maie be that the primitiue be write hole, &amp; 
then the addition put to it, nothing being like to let it, saue contraction 
which shortneth, and the beginning vowell in the addition defacing the 
ending, e, silent in the simple. Second, that where the addition is but a 
simple, s, after consonants, we maie vse either of the small esses, s, or 
<note>curly s</note>, as the pen shall require, <hi>wrings</hi>, or 
<hi>wring<note>curly s</note>
                  </hi>, <hi>trips</hi> or <hi>trip <note>curly s </note>
                  </hi>. Thirdlie that vowells, diphthongs, and the ending, h, or, s, haue 
es in their <hi>deriuatiues</hi>, as <hi>daies, sees, pyes, varies, does, foes, 
trewes, newes, bowes, dawes, dishes, fetches, matches, howses, horses</hi>. 
Fourth that such plurall numbers as bear no additions, be no naturall 
<hi>deriuatiues</hi>, as <hi>lice, mice, fete, men</hi>, of <hi>lowse, mouse, foot, 
man</hi>. That foren <hi>deriuations</hi> haue respect allwaie to their own 
originalls, as <hi>construction, persecution, argument, abundance</hi>, com 
not of <hi>constrew, persew, argew, abound</hi>, but of their own latin 
primitiues. That the plurall, e, encreaseth no syllabs, but in the qualifyed, 
s, c, g, &amp; sh, as <hi>uses, cases, causes, graces, spaces, spices, scurges, 
surges, wishes, rishes, aches</hi>. Where the passant, e, still resembleth 
the quik, i. That for the right taking of our termination in <hi>shon</hi>, we ar 
to mark the naturall foren <hi>deriuation</hi> verie carefullie, as <hi>action, 
passion, reflexion, pronunciation</hi>, all which sound like to our <hi>shon</hi>. 
The <hi>deriuatiues</hi> of words ending in the qualifying, e, kepe their 
forevowells sound, as <hi>bake, baking, take, taking</hi>. A number <pb n="148"/>
of such notes ar there in our tung, which I cannot intend to dwell on, 
bycause, I shew but the waie herein to others, if theie list to beat the path, 
my self minding a further labor. In these and such like considerations doth 
<hi>deriuation</hi> shew it self verie seruiceable for the right writing of our 
English tung, which will appear more particularlie in the generall table.

               <head>Of Distinction.</head>
               <p>THis title of <hi>distinction</hi> reacheth verie far, bycause it conteineth all 
those characts, and their vses, which I called before signifying, but not 
sounding, which help verie much, naie all in all to the right and tunable 
vttering of our words and sentences, by help of those characts, which we 
set down, and se in writing. The number of them be thirtene, and their 
names be <hi>Comma, Colon, Period, Parenthesis, Interogation, long time, 
shorte time, sharp accent, flat accent, streight accent, the seuerer, the 
uniter, the breaker</hi>. Whose forces, &amp; vses I will run thorow in order 
as theie ar named. <hi>Coma</hi>, is a small crooked point, which in writing 
followeth som small branch of the sentence, &amp; in reading warneth vs to 
rest there, and to help our breth a litle, as <hi>Who so shall spare the rod, 
shall spill the childe</hi>. <hi>Colon</hi> is noted by two round points one 
aboue another, which in writing followeth som full branch, or half the 
sentence, as <hi>Tho the daie be long: yet at the last commeth euensong</hi>. 
<hi>Period</hi> is a small round point, which in writing followeth a perfit 
sentence, and in reading warneth vs to rest there, and to help our breth at 
full, as <hi>The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.</hi>
                  <hi>Parenthesis</hi> is expressed by two half circles, which in writing 
enclose som perfit branch, as not mere impertinent, so not fullie concident 
to the sentence, which it breaketh, and in reading warneth vs, that the 
words inclosed by them, ar to be pronounced with a lower &amp; quikker 
voice, then the words either before or after them, as <hi>Bycause we ar not 
able to withstand the assalt of tentation (such is the frailtie of our natur) 
therefor we praie God, that our infirmitie be not put to the hasard of that 
triall</hi>. <hi>Interogation</hi> is expressed by two points one aboue another, 
wherof the vpper is somtimes <pb n="149"/>
croked which both in writing &amp; reading teacheth vs, that a 
question is asked there, where it is set, as <hi>Who taught the popiniaye to 
speak? the bellie</hi>: These fiue characts, that I haue allredie named, ar 
helps to our breathing, &amp; the distinct vtterance of our speche, not ruling 
within the word, as al those do which follow, but by the word, &amp; 
therefor com here in note, bycause theie ar creaturs to the pen, &amp; 
distinctions to pronoune by, &amp; therefor, as theie ar to be set down with 
iudgement in writing, so theie ar to be vsed with diligence in the right 
framing of the tender childes mouth. The two next concern the time, that is, 
the long or short pronouncing of syllabs, and ar not allwaie to be marked 
ouer that syllab, whereon theie shew their force, but with discretion &amp; 
vpon great cause for som manifest <hi>distinction</hi>, which rule we haue of 
the <hi>Latins</hi>, who vse their accents in that sort, and truble not their 
writing therewith, so much as the <hi>Grekes</hi> do, much lesse so much as 
the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>. <hi>The long time</hi>, is expressed by a streight 
outright line, which being set ouer anie vowell or diphthong, telleth vs, that 
the same vowell or diphthong, must be pronounced long, as 
<hi>repīning, perūsing, repēnting. The short 
time</hi>, is expressed by an half circle opening vpward, which standing 
aboue anie vowell or consonant, signifieth that the same is to be pronounced 
short and quik, as <hi>perf&amp;ibreveting, natŭrall, periŭrie, 
torm&amp;ebreventer, carp&amp;ebreventer</hi>. In the other fiue I gaue no further 
note then that theie were to be well markt, euen for that theie were writen 
to such an end, bycause the matter of their periods and branching, whereof 
manie learned men haue writen hole treatises, belongeth not to this place, 
but onelie their form to the eie, and their vse to the ear, which tendeth to 
the qualifying of our voice. For these two <hi>distinctions</hi> of time, which 
shew their force in words of two or mo syllabs, as the accents do in 
monosyllabs, I haue at this time to giue onlie som certain rules gathered 
vpon the dubling of our consonants, &amp; the qualifying, e, which 
qualifying, e, is a great leader in the certaining of our tung, for manie vses, 
but chefelie for the time: My first rule is, that a number of our deriuatiues 
ar short in their last syllab saue one, euen where the vowell cummeth befor 
two consonants whether the same or other, as <hi>perf&amp;ibrevetnesse, 
trau&amp;ebrevelling, peu&amp;ibreveshnesse</hi>, which argweth that their simples 
be such in natur as we call <hi>trochees</hi>, hauing <pb n="150"/>
the first syllab long and the latter short, or rather primitiues hauing both 
short, <hi>perf&amp;ibrevet, peu&amp;ibrevesh, trau&amp;ebrevell, rec&amp;obreverd</hi>, 
which differeth much from <hi>recōrding</hi>, and 
<hi>recōrder</hi>, of <hi>recōrde</hi>, the sponde. Again those 
primitiues which end in a quik diphthong do shorten the same diphthong in 
their deriuatiues as <hi>f&amp;ebrevell&amp;obrevew, f&amp;obrevell&amp;obrevew, 
hăll&amp;obrevew, fell&amp;obrevewship, foll&amp;obrevewer, 
hall&amp;obrevewed</hi>, whereas <hi>allow, endow, delaie, enioy,</hi> bring furth, 
<hi>endewed, allowance, anoyance</hi>. Again if the primitiue simple word 
haue the qualifying, e, in the end, as the vowell before it is sharp and long, 
so is it in the deriuatiue, as <hi>prescribe, prescribing, endure enduring</hi>. 
If the primitiue or simple word haue not, e, in the end, the vowell before the 
last consonant is short &amp; quik in both the primitiue &amp; the 
deriuatiue, as <hi>perfit, perf&amp;ibreveting, fortun, fortŭnat, natur, 
natŭrall</hi>, onelesse the primitiues single ending consonant be 
dubled in the deriuatiue, as <hi>concur, concurring</hi>. In which case either 
of dubling the same consonant, or of position by diuerse, the syllab is 
somtime long, as <hi>forbid, forbīdding, transport, 
transpōrting</hi>, somtime short, as <hi>gospell, gosp&amp;ebreveller, 
cons&amp;obrevert, cons&amp;obreverting</hi>. This shortnesse or length of time in 
the deriuatiues is a great leader, where to write or not to write the 
qualifying, e, in the end of simple words. For who will write, <hi>natur, 
perfit, measur, treasur</hi>, with an, e, in the end knowing their deriuatiues 
to be short, <hi>natŭrall, perf&amp;ibrevetlie, measŭred, 
treasŭrers</hi>? &amp; who will not write <hi>procure, endure, allure, 
endite, require</hi>, with an, e, finding their deriuatiues, 
<hi>procūrer, endūrance, allūrement, 
endīting, requītall</hi>, to haue the last saue one long? 
whereby the vse of the qualifying, e, is more the most euident. Whence also 
this generall rule for the writing thereof is to be gathered, that if ye desire 
to know whether the qualifying, e, be to be writen in the end of anie word or 
no, ye must vse the help of som deriuatiue, whether of two or of mo syllabs, 
whereby the time and tune of the deriuatiue, the, e, or not, e, in the originall 
is perceiued. For if the deriuatiue be long and shrill, the primitiue hath, e, 
as <hi>presuppose, conclude, remoue, prepare</hi> must be writen with, e, 
bycause the last syllab saue one in <hi>presuppōsing 
conclūding, remōuing, prepāred</hi>, is long. And 
again, <hi>fortun profit, consort</hi>, must haue no, e, bycause 
<hi>fortŭnat, prof&amp;ibreveting, comf&amp;obreverter</hi>, haue the last 
saue one short. So likwise in bisyllabs <hi>pine, pining, pin, pinning, mate, 
mating, mat matting</hi>. The like rule by conuersion <pb n="151"/>
will serue for time, that where the last saue one in the deriuatiue is short, 
the last in the primitiue is also short, as <hi>comf&amp;obreverting, 
ran&amp;sbreveking, comf&amp;obrevert, ransăk</hi>, and the contraries long. 
The other syllabs besides these for both time and tune in natur, follow the 
direction of the last syllab, as theie do also for the force of euerie vowell, 
diphthong, consonant or combination. Thus much concerning time at this 
time. The <hi>sharp accent</hi> is a streight line rising toward the right hand, 
which sheweth that the vowell or diphthong, ouer which it is, must be 
sounded sharp and high, as <hi>ráge, crépe, míne, hóme, 
púre</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>The <hi>flat accent</hi>, is a streight line rising towards the left hand, which 
sheweth that the vowell or diphthong ouer which it is must be sounded flat 
and quik, as <hi>ràg, stèp, thìn, fòr fiùr</hi>. The 
<hi>streight accent</hi>, is an vpright perpendicular line falling vpon som 
letter of duble force to shew in whether kinde it is to be vsed, as charact, 
thin, giue. For euerie of these thré accents, these rules ar to be 
obserued. That for cumbring of the lines and shew of difficultie, no accent 
is to be vsed but where nede is, and therefor where the accent is sene, the 
place is to be noted. That the sharp &amp; flat accents ar onelie to be set 
vpon the last syllab, where the sharp hath manie causes to present it self: 
the flat onlie vpon som rare difference, as <hi>refùse, refúse, 
prèsent, presént, recòrd, recórd, diffèr, 
différ, seuèr, seuére</hi>, and certain other of that sort, 
which ar noted in the generall table. The streight perpendicular accent, 
serueth onelie for those letters, diphthongs and coplements which be of 
duble forces, and is set vpon them in their lesse vsuall force: bycause their 
common and vsuall is more then their half naturall, and therefor not to be 
distinguished with anie accent. 


</p>
               <p>The duble forced letters be these, i, o, ou, ow, c, f, g, s, ch, th. Whereof c, f, 
and t, shall not nede anie expresse accent at all, bycause c, in hir weak 
force either goeth befoer i, or, c, or hath the qualifying, e, following hir, as 
<hi>hence, auance, once, pronounce</hi>, which wilbe sufficient notes for, c. 
F, soundeth vpon the consonantish u, onelie in, if, the abuerb conditionall, 
and of, the preposition. T, is cosen to, c, onelie in enfranchised words, 
where a vowell followeth after, t, as <hi>condition, faction, molestation</hi>. 
Neither is, s, to be noted with anie accent, after, l, m, n, r, <pb n="152"/>
or the silent, e, tho after them it sound still vpon the z, as <hi>hills, brims, 
guns, cars, times lines</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Therefor the chefe residence of the streight accent is ouer, i, in 
terminations in iue, as <hi>gíue, alíue, thríue</hi>. Where the 
contrarie sound cheks, as giue, <hi>liue, siue, shriuen</hi>. Ouer, o, in 
terminations in <hi>oue</hi>, where, o, soundeth strong, as <hi>loue, groue, 
throne</hi>, where the contrarie sound cheks, as <hi>loue, houe, aboue, 
moue</hi>. If, o, com in anie place not allredie noted for, u, and of anie 
difficultie for <hi>distinction</hi>, the streight accent is to be set ouer it, as 
<hi>móther</hi> for a girle in difference from <hi>mòther</hi>. Ou, 
and ow, sound most commonlie vpon the, u, and therefor if the streight 
accent be put vpon the, o, as in doubtfull cases it wold be, it is to be 
sounded full vpon the, o, and not, u. G, before, a, o, u, is out of controuersie 
strong, and therefor the difference is, when, g, cumming before, i, or, e, 
soundeth strong, which is contrarie to the naturall, or rather the 
<hi>Romane</hi> vse thereof, as in gig, begin, giue, geld, gird, gek, gilt and 
such other, where g, is somwhat mannish, and therefor is to be noted with 
the strong accent, and thereby expelleth the, u, which is made for hir strong 
supplement, in guy, guide, and yet hath another note of hir own, which must 
haue som accent, if this be vsed. For <hi>languish, anguish language</hi>, and 
such differ from guy, and guesse. But he that is acquainted with the 
<hi>Hebrew</hi> tung, will not meruell that a sillie point maketh a great 
<hi>distinction</hi> in the force of the same letters. S, betwene two vowells, 
is a maruellous deputie for, z, and therefor wold haue som handsom note, 
which will fall somwhat vnhandsomlie, the, s, being such a gangrell, 
onelesse the streight accent maie be conuenientlie set within the vpper 
bought, whereof, f, hath the like, thorow his verie hart. For in notes of 
<hi>distinction</hi> the most commodious charact is best currant. For ch, 
where it is strong the number is not manie, and therefor it maie well abide 
the perpendicular accent ouer the coplement, as charact, archangell. Th, is 
maruellous generall, and therefor in such generall words, as <hi>the, this, 
that, therefor, thence</hi>, and mo of that race, it nedeth not anie sensible 
distinction, where common vse will streight waie be the teacher. Howbeit 
in manie places it will proue nedefull to note the weak, th, with this 
streight accent, tho som generall rules maie <pb n="153"/>
oftimes ease it. As that when anie word, which is both a noun and a verb 
endeth in th, the noun soundeth strong, as <hi>breath, mouth</hi>, and the 
verbe weak, as sooth, breath, mouth. And again o, before, th, with, e, 
following next, soundeth vpon the weak side, as <hi>mother, other, 
brother</hi>. Therefor the perpendicular accent sitteth vpon the weak, s, 
and, th, vpon the strong, i, o, ou, ow, g, ch, where nede doth require. If anie 
wold haue two continent letters both to be noted with the streight accent, 
as giue, one betwene them both maie serue the turn by learned presidents in 
the like case. This rule of <hi>distinction</hi> must be som what curiouslie 
kept in the generall table, as the common master, &amp; in the elementarie 
reading, as the common introductorie. Thus much for the thre accents. The 
<hi>seuering note</hi>is expressed by two points, the one following the other, 
which being set ouer two vowells or the latter vowell in a diphthong declare 
that theie be to be referred to diuerse syllabs, whereas otherwise theie 
might belong to one, as <hi>going, varietie, allied, vowell following</hi>. The 
<hi>uniting line</hi> is expressed by a long stroke betwene two syllabs, 
whereby it is ment that those two syllabs ar parcells of one word, being 
seuered so either by change thorough the writers ouersight, or vpon som 
particular consideration, as <hi>for-think, fare-think</hi>. The <hi>breaker</hi>
is expressed by two outright strokes one vnder another in the end of a line, 
and giueth vs to wit, that the word which it so breaketh is parted by full 
syllabs, whereof som be writen in the line before: som in that which 
followeth, as <hi>contrarie, magistrate</hi>. Here is the rule of 
<hi>composition</hi> and right spelling to be considered. These points be 
theie, which I think most worthie the consideration in the matter of 
<hi>distinction</hi>, tho the particular argument maie sprede further.

               <head>Of Enfranchisment</head>
               <p>ALL the words which we do vse in our tung be either naturall English, and 
most of one syllab, or borowed of the fore, and most of manie syllabs. 
Whereby our tung semeth to haue two heds, the one homeborn, the other a 
stranger whereof either hath a great train following it. The causes of either <pb n="154"/>
be these. While the inhabitants of our cuntrie neither encumbred their 
braines with much studie, neither bissied their heds with great trafik, 
neither pleased their fantsies with far trauell, theie vsed no other terms, 
then such as their own nede enforced them vnto, which being allwaie fed 
with home occasions desired no help of foren tungs, to vtter those things 
with their words which were deuised without their wits. But after that the 
desire of learning enflamed studie, the longing for gain brought in great 
traffik, the delight to range, did cause men trauell, new occasions brought 
furth new words, as either more cunning made waie to more terms, or as 
strange deuises did seke strange deliueries. For when the minde is fraught 
with matter to deliuer, it is still in pain vntill it haue deliuered, and 
therefor to haue the deliuerie such, as maie discharge the thing well, and 
content all parties, both by whom and to whom the matter is deliuered, it 
seketh both home helps, where theie be sufficient, and significant, and 
where the own home yeildeth nothing at all, or not pithie enough, it craueth 
help of that tung, from whence it receiued the matter of deliuerie. Hence 
commeth it that we haue our tung commonlie both stored and enlarged with 
our neighbours speches, and the old learned tungs. A thing not proper to vs 
alone, but common to all those, which vse anie speche in matters more then 
ordinarie, naie in matters aboue the brutish. The necessitie of these foren 
words must nedes be verie great bycause the number of them is so verie 
manie, as it doth appear most plainlie by the generall table, where hole 
ranks of <hi>enfranchised</hi> terms do match togither in one front. To whom 
we ar much beholden, for that theie vouchsafe to becom English to serue our 
nede, as their peple ar to thank our tung, for returning the like help, in cases 
of like nede, tho their occasions to vse ours be nothing so often, as ours to 
vse theirs. 


</p>
               <p>This benefit of the foren tung, which we vse in making their termes to 
becom ours, with som alteration in form, according to the frame of our 
speche, tho with the continewing in substance of those words, which ar so 
vsed, that it maie apear both whence theie com, and to whom theie com, I 
call <hi>enfranchisment</hi>, by which verie name the words <pb n="155"/>
that ar so <hi>enfranchised</hi>, becom bond to the rules of our writing, which 
I haue named before, as the stranger denisons be to the lawes of our cuntrie. 
And tho the learned <hi>enfranchiser</hi> maie somtime yeild to much to the 
foren, either for shew of learning, or by persuasions that it is best so, yet 
he doth not well, considering that the verie natur of <hi>enfranchisment</hi>
doth enforce obedience to the <hi>enfranchisers</hi> lawes, not to be 
measured by his bare person, but by the <hi>custom, reason &amp; sound</hi>, 
of his cuntries speche. And as vnaduised cunning, or not sufficientlie 
aduised, doth plaie to much vpon the foren string, being verie loth to leaue 
out anie one letter, as <hi>eleemosinarie</hi>, for <hi>amner, hospitall</hi> and 
<hi>victuall</hi> for <hi>spitle vitle</hi> and such other. So mere ignorance and 
not willing to learn, but presuming vpon it self writeth so vnwarilie, as 
<hi>whole</hi>, for <hi>hole</hi>, which is manifest <hi>greke</hi>, &amp; to begin 
with h, &amp;c. And as it is verie good for our English man to know the 
force of his own naturall words, so it cannot be but good to know the foren, 
if the right in writing, be anie right worth waing, <hi>signet,</hi> for a litle 
<hi>signe</hi>, or <hi>seall</hi>, and <hi>cygnet</hi>, for a young <hi>swan</hi>, ar 
descried that waie, In <hi>signe</hi>, g, soundes not, in <hi>signify</hi> it doth. 
Wherefor I think it best for the strange words to yeild to our lawes, bycause 
we ar both their vsuaries &amp; fructuaries, both to enioy their frutes, and 
to vse themselues, and that as near as we can, we make them mere English, 
as <hi>Iustinian</hi> did make the incorporate peple, mere <hi>Romanes</hi>, and 
banished the terms, of both <hi>latins</hi> &amp; <hi>yeildlings</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>The vse of this <hi>enfranchisement</hi> is as large in our tung, as our nede is 
in deliuerie, which being capable of all arguments, makes vs subiect to all 
words. I know no other diuision of <hi>enfranchised</hi>, words, then after 
the tungs fom <note>sic</note> whence we borow them, as <hi>Latin, Greke, 
Hebrew, Italian, French, Spanish, Dutch, Scottish</hi>, &amp;c. Which ar 
freid amongst vs, as the present nede of either them with vs, or vs with 
them, doth sew to be incorporate. 


</p>
               <p>Which we haue from which, it is not here so nedefull to declare, where the 
question is not of the substance &amp; sense of the word, but of the right 
writing. And yet the generall table will shew that I haue not bene verie 
negligent that waie. But concerning the writing, me think the common men 
ought to yeild therein <pb n="156"/>
to the vse of those that be learned, least if theie will not, theie misse as 
foullie in the writing of them, as theie vse them madlie, in mistaking their 
meaning. And again the learned in their <hi>enfranchising</hi> them must 
nedes haue their eie, vpon our <hi>proportion</hi> our <hi>accent</hi>, our 
<hi>deriuation</hi> and such other, according to the <hi>reason , custom</hi>, and 
<hi>sound</hi> of our speche, reseruing that to the stranger which our tung 
cannot rule, as if ye once passe the third syllab, our tung is husht. To proue 
anie of these things by examples, which be euerie where so common, it shall 
not nede. In this verie chapter of <hi>enfranchisment</hi>, tho I do not affect 
anie extraordinarie forenism, yet how manie foreners am I constraned to 
vse? <hi>Verie, chapter, enfranchisment, affect, extraordinarie, foren, 
forenism, constrained, use</hi>, in this last sentence do easilie proue, that it 
were to foren from the matter, to seke examples of foren words. Wherefor 
to knit vp this note of <hi>enfranchisment</hi> in few words, the English rule 
for writing, must be the right thereof, tho it kepe still manie signes of a 
stranger, tho yet incorporat with vs, which rule the <hi>Italian</hi> semeth to 
obserue both wiselie and well. If ye write <hi>philosophie</hi>, ye do write to 
much vpon the foren, if <hi>filosohie</hi>, not to much vpon the English. If ye 
will nedelie kepe the clear foren, it were good to vse the ordinarie 
premunition, (that it is so writen in the primitiue tung.) And whereas the 
learnedder sort, as <hi>Tullie</hi> him self, allow not the interlacing of 
<hi>Greke</hi> words in <hi>Latin</hi>, the meaning of that their saing tendeth 
to this my conclusion. For if we haue of our own, as significant and as 
proper, what nede a rich man to be a thefe? If we haue either none or not so 
toward, why in our own nede, shall we not <hi>enfranchis</hi> forenners? If 
we mean to vse them but for a time, or to som end the premunition will be 
our warrant. If we mean to make them ours, then let them take an other to 
be trew to our tung, and the ordinances thereof. If this point be not agreid 
on, great inconueniences will follow, and all the rules, which be kept in our 
tung, must take exception against the foren, or the foren aginst them, when 
theie com to the writing. 


</p>
               <p>Wherefor it will proue best for all parts, that our tung, &amp; the rules of 
hir right writing be made the generall right. For the naturall words, the 
propertie is hir own, for the foren the vse <pb n="157"/>
is hirs, and therefor the handling of them to hir own best. 


</p>
               <p>Neither must anie learned man think it strange to write foren Englished 
terms after an English ear, seing it is not contrarie to the custom of his 
cuntrie. Neither is it anie embasing to learning, to lend the common man the 
vse of his learning, tho he kepe the substance: neither yet both to se, and 
suffer the learneddest terms that he hath, to com vnder an English hand, 
seing there is no dishonor ment them, where theie be made peres to our own. 
Thus much at this time concerning the right writing of foren words, when 
theie becom ours to vse, and attire themselues to the English complexion, 
which we our selues think reasonable well of, and I as well as anie, what 
account soeuer my thinking maie be of, in such an argument, as I haue 
thought thus much of.

            <div xml:id="c1.23" type="chapter">
               <head>Of Prerogatiue</head>
               <p>I Said before, that those men, which will giue anie certain direction for the 
writing of anie tung, or for anie thing else, which concerneth anie tung, 
must take som period in the tung, or else their rules will proue vnrulie. For 
euerie tung hath a certain ascent from the meanest to the height, and a 
discent again from the height to the meanest, the one in the remouing kinde, 
as the other was in mounting. And as in the ascent it is not yet com to the 
assurance of note, bycause it is not thoroughlie artificiall, so in the discent 
it growes not worth the noting, bycause it becoms rude again, and in a maner 
withered. Hence commeth it, that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his age is the prince 
of <hi>Grece, Tullies</hi> age the flour of <hi>Rome</hi>, whose tungs if learned 
writing had not commended to the tuition of books, theie had ben of small 
worth, naie of no remembrance, long before this daie: as the spoken tungs of 
the same soils beginning in their daies to change, be now quite altered, or at 
the least nothing like that, where the carnation grew, tho full of good 
flowers in an other kinde. So that kooks giue life where bodies bring but 
death. Mark the <hi>Greke</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> writers before, and <pb n="158"/>
after those mens ages, and by comparing them with these, ye shall se the 
ods that I speak of, and the one to rude to be ruled, the other departing from 
their rule, and yeilding to a change. This period of mine, and these risings 
to mount, as the dismounting again, till decaie ensew, do giue vs to wit, 
that as all things else, which belong to man be subiect to change, so the 
tung also is, which changeth with the most, and yet contineweth with the 
best. Whereupon it must nedes be that there is some soulish substance in 
euerie spoken tung, which fedeth this change, euen with perceptible means, 
that pretend alteration. For if anie tung be absolute, and fre from motion, it 
is shrined vp in books, and not ordinarie in vse, but made immortall by the 
register of memorie. 


</p>
               <p>This secret misterie, or rather quikning spirit in euerie spoken tung, and 
therefor in ours, call I <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, bycause when <hi>sound</hi> hath 
don his best, when <hi>reason</hi> hath said his best, when <hi>custom</hi> hath 
effected, what is best in both, this <hi>prerogatiue</hi> will except against 
anie of them all, and all their rules, be theie neuer so generall, be theie 
neuer so certain. Whereby it maketh a waie to a new change that will 
follow in som degre of the tung, if the writers period be chosen at the best. 
I cannot compare this customarie <hi>prerogatiue</hi> in speche to anie thing 
better, then vnto those, which deuise new garments, and by law ar left to 
the libertie of deuise. Hence cummeth it in apparell, that we be not like 
ourselues anie long time, tho the best &amp; most semelie (like an artificial 
rule) do bets please the wisest peple. But by the waie is it not a maruell, 
that the period of a tung, being so quik an instrument, shall continew longer, 
then the fashion of apparell, being a thing so thought on, &amp; sadlie 
misformd? Vpon the like libertie in speche, to be hir own caruer, com our 
exceptions against our generall rules. Hence coms the writing of 
<hi>com</hi>, the simple with, o, the compound with, u, <hi>cumfort 
cumpasse</hi>. Hence, <hi>whom, &amp; most</hi> sound lik, <hi>rom &amp; 
roste</hi>, tho not qualifyed with, e. Hence cometh it that, <hi>enough, bough, 
tough</hi> &amp; such other primitiues be so stranglie writen, and more 
strangelie sounded. Whereby <hi>prerogatiue</hi> semeth to be a quiksiluer in 
<hi>custom</hi>, euer stirring, and neuer stated tho the generall 
<hi>custom</hi>, as a thing of good staie do still offer it self to be ordered by 
<hi>rule</hi>, as a nere frind to <hi>reason</hi>. This stirring <pb n="159"/>
quintessence the leader to change in a thing that is naturallie 
changeable, and yet not blamed for the change, som not verie well aduised 
peple, esteme as an error, and a priuat misuse contrarie to <hi>custom</hi>, 
bycause it semes to be a verie imperious controller, but theie ar deceiued. 
For in dede this <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, tho it check generall conclusions, 
thorough priuat oppositions, yet that opposition came not of priuat men, but 
it is a priuat thing it self, and the verie life blood, which preserueth tungs 
in their naturall best from the first time that theie grew to account, till 
theie com to decaie, &amp; a new period growen, different from the old, tho 
excellent in the altered kinde, and yet it self to depart, and make roum for 
another, when the circular turn shall haue ripened alteration. 


</p>
               <p>I take this present period of our English tung to be the verie height thereof, 
bycause I find it so excellentlie well fined, both for the bodie of the tung it 
self, and for the customarie writing thereof, as either foren workmanship 
can giue it glosse, or as homewrought hanling can giue it grace. When the 
age of our peple, which now vse the tung so well, is dead and departed there 
will another succede, and with the peple the tung will alter and change. 
Which change in the full haurest thereof maie proue comparable to this, but 
sure for this which we now vse, it semeth euen now to be at the best for 
substance, and the brauest for circumstance, and whatsoeuer shall becom of 
the English state, the English tung cannot proue fairer, then it is at this 
daie, if it maie please our learned sort to esteme so of it, and to bestow 
their trauell vpon such a subiect, so capable of ornament, so proper to 
themselues, and the more to be honored, bycause it is their own. The force 
of <hi>prerogatiue</hi> is such as maie not be disobeied tho it seme to 
disorder som well ordered rule, and cause som peple wonder which weie not 
the cause. 


</p>
               <p>Wherefor when anie note shall com in place quite contrarie to the common 
not <hi>custom</hi>, but precept, then must we nedes think of 
<hi>prerogatiues</hi> power, a great princesse in proces, and a parent to 
corruption, but withall intending to rase another <hi>Phenix</hi> from the 
former ashes. Which <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, who soeuer he be, that will not 
graunt to anie tung, denyeth it to haue life, onelesse his meaning be, by 
registring som period in it of most <pb n="160"/>
excellent note to restraine <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, and to preserue the tung, 
which he enrolleth by writing from the peples prophaning, by making of it 
learned, and exempting from corruption, as our book languages be, whose 
rule is so certain, as theie dream of no change. This <hi>prerogatiue</hi> and 
libertie, which the peple hath to vse both speche and pen at will, is the 
case, and yet not blamed therefor, why the English writers be now finer, 
then theie were som hundreth yeares ago, tho som antiquarie, will take the 
old writing to be finer. But the question is wherein finenesse standeth. So 
was <hi>Salust</hi> deceiued among the <hi>Romans</hi>, liuing with eloquent 
<hi>Tullie</hi>, and writing like ancient <hi>Cato</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>But in one generall word to tuch both this <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, and my other 
six rules, with the verie generall method, wherewith I haue traced the right 
of our writing, I do take them all to be verie well grounded, neither is there 
anie thing at all, set down by me in waie of obseruation concerning the tung, 
be it neuer so strange, or rather seme it neuer so strange, but it is as 
artificiall, and of as sure note, as the best language is. Which I shall not 
nede in this so petie a principle to proue by particulars, neither to raise vp 
again a sort of horie heded writers, both grammarians and greater in the 
verie best speches, from out of their graues to subscribe to my rules. It is 
enough for me that the learned find this trew in their own trauell, and that 
the vnlearned be content to beleue the learned, that I vtter a truth, tho I 
bring not in a <hi>Priscian</hi>, or anie <hi>Priscianlike</hi> ortografer or anie 
of the twelue old grammarians likned to the nine muses and the thre graces 
in the <hi>Latin</hi> tung. Which tung I rest still on, as commonlie best known 
to our bookish peple. That my cuntrie <hi>custom</hi> doth fight stoutlie for 
me, that euen <hi>sound</hi>it self is found of my side, and that the best 
<hi>reason</hi>, is my greatest frind, naie my verie good ladie, no man I hope 
will deny me, being so redie to content him, but more redie to procede, and 
perform mine enterprise. 


</p>
               <p>In this writing <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, the verie pen it self is a great doer and of 
maruellous autoritie, which bycause it is the secretarie alone, and 
executeth all, that the wit can deliuer, presumeth therefor much, &amp; will 
venter as far, as anie counseller else, of what soeuer calling, tho neuer 
against <hi>reason</hi>, whose instrument it is <pb n="161"/>
to satisfe the sight, as the tung doth the ear. <hi>Custom</hi>, (whose charge 
<hi>prerogatiue</hi> is, as the pen is his conueier) fauoreth the pen 
excedinglie much, and will not stik to stand to it, that a dash with a pen 
maie hold for a warrant, where both dispatch for spede, and grace for fair 
letter bid the pen be bold. Hence cummeth it that so manie zeds in our tung 
ar herd, &amp; so few sene, for dexteritie and spede in the currantnesse of 
writing. And as the pen can do this, so I do take it that our verie tung vpon 
<hi>prerogatiue</hi> for smoothnesse, vseth the z, so much for, s, &amp; the 
weak, th, the v wish, o, and such others of the duble sounds. 


</p>
               <p>But it maie be said that all our exceptions of most reasonable 
<hi>prerogatiue</hi>, maie be well reduced to the general form, as why not 
<hi>whome, moste, whear, thear, hear</hi>, and a number such, as well as, 
<hi>home, coste, fear</hi>, and such, which I contrarie not at all, tho I se som 
difficultie in altering that, which our <hi>custom</hi> hath so grasped. And it 
were to much almost to require that of anie wise and learned man, so to 
arrest exceptions, chefelie in such a thing, as will not proue a standard, tho 
he that wisheth this, seme to conceiue such a thing, which tho it were 
granted, yet wold it break out again furthwith som other waie, and cause a 
greater gap. Bycause no banks can kepe it in so strait, bycause no strength 
can withstand such a stream, bycause no vessell can hold such a liquor, but 
onelie those banks which in flowing ar content to be somtimes ouerrun, 
onelie those staies which in furie of water will bend like a bulrush, onelie 
that vessell which in holding of the humor, will receiue som it self, as 
allowing of the relice. If anie ignorant pen, either ignorantlie, or vpon 
ignorant ground, tho pretending knowledge and good resolution, do offend 
against <hi>reason</hi>, and intrude vpon <hi>prerogatiue</hi>, that is no right 
quill, neither auowed by me, as neither that currant is to be called 
<hi>custom</hi>, which holdeth by vsurpation, neither that cause to be counted 
<hi>reason</hi>, which hath other beginning, then right knowledge, or other 
ending, then the natur of that thing, wil seme to admit, for whom that 
<hi>reason</hi> speaketh. And certainlie when I consider the thing depelie, as 
my thoughts in this case haue not bene slight, neither mere superficiall, I 
cannot se, when these imperfections be remoued, which stil companie 
perfection, and by eaise notes maie easlie be remoued, <pb n="162"/>
with contentment of the wise, tho with the wonder of som, which ar blinded 
with their own, but that our tungs <hi>prerogatiue</hi> maie full well take 
place, &amp; the pen also his, considering our <hi>custom</hi> is becom so 
orderlie, as it maie well be ruled, without either chopping or changing of 
anie letter at all, or otherwise praing aid of anie foren inuention, more then 
I haue set down, &amp; said enough of. 


</p>
               <p>These be the notes which I promised to giue for the ordering of our tung, 
&amp; the right writing thereof, wherein if I haue hit right, the right will be 
my warrant, yea tho it seme not right to som, wherein I comfort my selfe 
tho I content not all. <hi>Aristides</hi> once made an oration to the peple of 
<hi>Athens</hi>, and was wonderfullie well like, euen with som clapping of 
hands, or som popular shout, which generall liking he so misliked, as he 
asked som frind, who stood next vnto him, what ill he had spoken, bycause it 
was so liked, as if it were not possible for anie good thing to win general 
liking, tho the right be rightlie honored of hir own children, as our greatest 
&amp; best orator in scripture speaketh. But as it shall please God, so shall 
my trauell take place if it please, I will be glad, if it please not I will not 
fear, so the displeased partie be no principall best. I wold neither be an 
<hi>Herod</hi> to be eaten with ice for the puf of great allowance, neither yet 
a <hi>Cicero</hi> to shrink in <hi>Miloes</hi> right, for either crashing of armor, 
or craking of speche, my argument being such, as wil bear it self out, &amp; 
my pacience such, as can abide time till either other men se me &amp; allow 
if I deserue, or my self se my self, and amend mine own misse. It is an 
easie thing to find falt, &amp; therefor much vsed, it is hard to iudge right, 
and therefor not ordinarie. If learned secretaries will hede their pen, &amp; 
skillfull correctors be charie of their print, neither will these things seme 
strange, neither <hi>prerogatiue</hi> be pointed at, but euerie right in writing 
be mesured by right in iudgement. And in verie dede as I said before, all my 
notes do more concern the pen, and the dispatch there, then the print and his 
statarie form. Now will I set down the generall table, which will supply all 
that by particular words, whatsoeuer is wanting in my generall precept. 

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="c1.24" type="chapter">
               <head>The use of the generall table.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163"/>AS I promised before, so now I will knit vp this argument of right writing 
with a generall table, wherein I haue gathered the most of those words, 
which we commonlie vse in our hole speche. Which table I take to be verie 
proper to this purpos, and vpon sundrie causes. First for the confirming of 
my rules, with multitude of examples, which I proued with som few naie oft 
with some one, when I set them first down: a thing both plane, to enstruct a 
reader, &amp; also pithie, to enforce a rule by vertew of number. 


</p>
               <p>Secondlie, for the perfiting of <hi>proportion</hi>, a great officer in directing 
the pen, as being chefe marshall to set words in araie, according to their 
sounds. Which sounds bewraing themselues best in the last syllabs, as being 
therefor best hard, bycause theie ar last said, recommend themselues 
therein to the rule of <hi>proportion</hi>, tho not without both nede, and hope 
of further help, for the first and midle syllabs, to haue their 
<hi>proportion</hi> thereby full and sutable in all. Which help this table 
promiseth, as preciselie examining the beginning of words by order of the 
letter, as <hi>proportion</hi> sought out the ending thereof, by likenesse in 
sound. Which two syllabs, the first and last being certainlie known, if there 
be mo, then all be known. But if there be mo, where the extremities be 
certain, the midle maie be sene. 


</p>
               <p>Thirdlie the <hi>enfranchised</hi> words, which we borow of the foren, being a 
great parcell of our ordinarie speche, bycause we deal so much with such 
matters, as enforce vs thereunto, while we vtter that which we learn, as 
theie do of whom we learn, not hauing of our selues to exprese that in 
speche, which we haue but of others to execute in dede: such a generall 
table is a conuenient gide to deliuer them to our eies. Wherewith to cloie 
the rule of <hi>enfranchisment</hi>, where som few maie serue by waie of 
example, were either to duble them, if theie be in both, or to lame the table 
if theie be but in the rule: both great ouersights. Wherefor contenting the 
rule with sufficient number, to make it plane, I haue vsed the table for a 
common treasurie where to laie vp all. 


</p>
               <p>Fourthlie the affinitie betwene the rule, which examineth the generall 
direction by particular proufs &amp; the particular poufs, which range 
themselues in order, by generall direction, is so near <pb n="164"/>
amp so great, as it cannot otherwise be, but that manie things will fall out 
in examining the table, which proues by particular, whereby the rules shalbe 
helpt: besides their confirming in natur of example: as the rules 
themselues, which direct in generall do offer that assurance, whereby the 
table shalbe staied, besides the sorting of particular words, into 
proportionat ranks. 


</p>
               <p>Fiftlie and last, the generall table is a mean to help ignorance, and a waie to 
ease cunning. For the ignorant man, which cannot iudge of sounds by 
finenesse of his ear, will soon discern forms by sharpnesse of his eie &amp; 
quicklie finde out the vse of a table, tho he seldom fele the sense of a rule. 
And the skilfull man also, which can iudge of a rule, if he haue time to read 
it, in want of leisure to read, maie haue recourse to his table, and so satisfy 
the sudain, till conuenient time will giue him leaue to studie. The table 
therefor being a thing of such commoditie, to confirm rules, to perfit 
<hi>proportion</hi>, to discouer <hi>enfranchisments</hi>, to supply all wants, 
to help ignorance, and to ease knowledge: I haue so framed it, I hope, both 
for store of words, and choice of notes, as it shall perform all this, 
whereunto it is said to be so profitable. 


</p>
               <p>For the words, which concern the substance thereof: I haue gathered 
togither so manie of them both enfranchised and naturall, as maie easilie 
direct our generall writing, either bycause theie be the verie most of those 
words which we commonlie vse, or bycause all other, whether not here 
expresesd or not yet inuented, will conform themselues, to the presidencie 
of these. If my leisur wold haue serued, I wold haue sought out mo, but 
these maie seme enough, which both serue the thing, &amp; discharge me. 
Who entending at the first to deal no lower, then the entrie to speche, vpon 
great occasion haue bene forced further to deuise an Elementarie, a thing as 
different from my first purpos, as it is verie pertinent to the common 
profit. 


</p>
               <p>For the notes, besides the beginning letter, which I haue curiouslie 
obserued, both to find out most words by that kinde of method, and withall 
to perform that, which is required in a table, to direct him that sekes by 
order of the letter, I haue had speciall regard to mine own rules, that both 
table &amp; rule agreing in one, my labour thereby maie sooner win 
allowance. <pb n="165"/>
Therefor when soeuer anie great cause of note doth offer it self, either in 
accent for <hi>distinction</hi>, or in change for <hi>proportion</hi>, or in 
strangenesse for <hi>deriuation</hi>, or in writing for <hi>enfranchisment</hi>, 
or in propertie for <hi>custom</hi>, either in penning or pronouncing, bycause 
it reigneth in both: the accents ar set ouer the consonants or vowells, 
which require <hi>distinction</hi>: the changing of <hi>proportion</hi>, the 
strangenesse of <hi>deriuation</hi>, the propertie of <hi>custom</hi> is 
presentlie noted: and the <hi>enfranchised</hi> words be first set down in 
their naked and naturall colros, and after writen so as our cuntrie doth 
clothe them, and our <hi>custom</hi> doth allow them. 


</p>
               <p>This haue I don, and thus, which whether it be the right waie, to direct our 
writing or no: that I leaue to other mens iudgement, contenting my self 
with these two reasons. First bycause I se those writers, which haue 
trauelled in other tungs, for the right writing thereof, whose labor also hath 
taken good effect, and euen at this daie doth gide all our studies, bycause 
their successe proueth the rightnesse of their waie, to haue cut this same 
course, and by examining ech syllab to haue certained all, not by rasing new 
characts, but by ruling old <hi>custom</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Second, bycause he which quite altereth the natur of such a thing, as is said 
to be corrupted, doth not amend the old falt but tendereth vs a new 
substance, as subiect to blame, as the former was, naie oftimes more, the 
deformitie thereof appearing in the face, and the infirmitie thereof not able 
to bear age, as the other did, in whose roum it cummeth. Whereas in dede in 
such a case, where the substance maie remain, tho som error be stript, a 
good director will first sift the certain right from the supposed wrong, and 
in ruling them both call <hi>custom</hi> to counsell, from whom the right 
came, as all men know, and by whom the wrong must be helpt, as theie that 
mark, maie se. 


</p>
               <p>But not to tary long in a matter so plane, and so examined before, this is 
most trew, that long and waking <hi>custom</hi>, in the matter of speche, 
wherein she commandeth without vsurpation, wherein she hath propertie 
without intrusion, and wherein she deals not without consideration, of force 
must haue hir <pb n="166"/>
imperiall voyce, when the question is, what currant were best, for directing 
of the pen. For that is no correction which wasteth the substance, but that 
washeth the accidents, and that in such sort, as the cuntrie <hi>custom</hi>
will best admit, vpon former acquaintance. 


</p>
               <p>Thus much haue I don for the right writing of our English tung, desiring my 
cuntrimen to think well of my labor, and themselues to trauell in furnishing 
out the rest, which I cannot deal with, if theie like of that which I haue 
hitherto don: if not, I wold be glad to be directed my self by som president 
of another, which shall taste of iudgement. 


</p>
               <p>Mine own course doth carie me quite another waie, from medling with such 
things, as this argument is: &amp; yet not altogither so, but that where 
good cause shall offer occasion, and fit circumstance shalbe answerable to 
such cause, I wilbe verie redie to pleasur mine own cuntrie, to the vtmost of 
my power, yea euen in the middest of anie foren learning: Tho my drift be 
such, as I maie sooner minister occasion of much matter to such as will 
dwell vpon particular discourse, then my self digresse from that plat, which 
is alredie laied, being more then enough, to occupy anie one. 


</p>
               <p>It were a thing verie praiseworthie in my opinion, and no lesse profitable 
then prasie worthie, if som one well learned and as laborious a man, wold 
gather all the words which we vse in our English tung, whether naturall or 
incorporate, out of all professions, as well learned as not, into one 
dictionarie, and besides the right writing, which is incident to the 
Alphabete, wold open vnto vs therein, both their naturall force, and their 
proper vse: that by his honest trauell we might be as able to iudge of our 
own tung, which we haue by rote, as we ar of others, which we learn by rule. 
The want whereof, is the onelie cause why, that verie manie men, being 
excellentlie well learned in foren speche, can hardlie discern what theie 
haue at home, still shooting fair, but oft missing far, hard censors ouer 
other, ill executors themselues. For easie obtaining is enemie to iudgement, 
not onelie in words, and naturall speche, but in greater matters, and verie 
important. Aduised &amp; <pb n="167"/>
considerat cumming by, as it proues by those tungs, which we learn by Art, 
where time and trauell be the compaassing means, emplanteth in wits, both 
certaintie to rest on, &amp; assurance to rise by. Our naturall tung cummeth 
on vs by hudle, and therefor hedelesse, foren language is labored, and 
therefor learned, the one still in vse and neuer will known, the other well 
known and verie seldom vsed. And yet continewall vse should enfer 
knowledge, in a thing of such vse, as the naturall deliuerie of our minde and 
meaning is. And to saie the truth what reason is it, to be acquainted abrode, 
and a stranger at home? to know foren tungs by rule, and our own but by 
rote? If all other men had ben so affected, to make much of the foren, and 
set light by their own, as we seme to do, we had neuer had these things, 
which we like of so much, we should neuer by comparing haue discerned the 
better. Theie proined their own speche, both to please themselues, and to 
set vs on edge: and why maie not we by following of their presidents be 
partakers of their praise? considering the thing which we ar to deal in, of 
it self is so good, &amp; the presidents, which to folow, to be so manie 
&amp; so plane: as we can neither alledge anie warnt for direction, ne yet 
basenesse of argument, to diliuer vs from trauell. For the matter of speche 
is a thing well thought of, whether ye waie the words and the forces which 
theie haue, or the vttering thereof by pen &amp; voyce. Naturall nede vpon 
mere vse, commendeth the voyce, delite in mere vse commendeth the pen, 
delite in more vse commendeth fair writing. Which both ar so well estemed 
of, as there be particular Arts, verie cunninglie deuised to beautify them 
both. We nede not to proue by <hi>Platoes Cratylus</hi>, or <hi>Aristotles</hi>
proposition as by best autorities, (tho men be sufficient to proue their own 
inuentions) that words be voluntarie, and appointed vpon cause, seing we 
haue better warrant. For euen God himself, who brought the creatures, 
which he had made, vnto that first man, whom he had also made, that he 
might name them, according to their properties, doth planelie declare by his 
so doing, what a cunning thing it is to giue right names, and how necessarie 
it is, to know their forces, which he allredie giuen, bycause the word being 
knowen, which implyeth the propertie <pb n="169"/>
the thing is half known, whose propertie is emplyed. Therefor the 
argument of words, speche, &amp; pen being so necessarie, &amp; the 
trauelling in them being no lesse commendable, he that will deal in that 
which I haue said, shall both help nede in others, &amp; heap praise to 
himself, &amp; yet do nothing without manifold president. For among the 
Hebrewes, <hi>Ionas, Iudas, Kimchi</hi>, among the Grekes, <hi>Eustathius, 
Fauorine, Pollux</hi>, among the Latins, <hi>Marcus Varro, Nonius Marcellus, 
Festus Pompeius</hi>, tho not these alone, nor in these tungs alone, 
endeuored themselues to do that in their tungs, which I wish for in ours, 
expounding their own words by their own language. The <hi>Italian</hi>, the 
<hi>Frenche</hi>, the <hi>Spanish</hi>, at this daie vse the like: naie theie go 
further, and make particualr dictionaries euen to particular books, as 
<hi>Iohn Boccace</hi> alone hath a dictionarie for himself in the Italian tung. 
Now if such like English wits, in whom both learning and labor do concur, 
wold do so much for our tung, as these and the like haue don for theirs, naie 
as euen learners haue don, for those same tungs, which theie haue gained by 
labor, as <hi>Staphanus, Perot, Calepine</hi>, for the latin and others for 
other: we should then know what we both write and speak: we should then 
discern the depth of their conceits, which either coined our own words, or 
incorporated the foren. Whereas at this daie: we be skillfull abode 
<note>sic</note> and ignorant at home, wondring at others not waing our 
own. Thus much at this time concerning these things, now must I to my 
table.

               <head>The conclusion of this treatis concerning the right writing of our English tung.</head>
               <pb n="226"/>
               <p>THis is that, which I had to saie concerning the right writing of our English 
tung, both for the rules, which I haue obserued in dailie experience, and for 
the table, which I haue collected to confirm that experience. As for the 
right of my rules, I maie not take vpon me anie more certaintie, then the 
naturall force of such probable directions doth ordinarilie infer, which is to 
hold commonlie trew, and euer most likelie, from which probabilitie I 
wander not far, if my self maie be iudge. As for the table I sought in it, to 
write all the words generallie after an English ear, neuer yeilding much to 
anie foren letter sauing onelie where som pretie occasion recommended vnto 
me, the duble writing of both the naturall English &amp; the incorporate 
stranger. And yet I haue diligentlie examined the originall grounds of our 
<hi>enfranchised</hi> terms, which be one third part of our hole speche, tho I 
hold altogeather with our own writing, &amp; follow not their primitiue. 
For if the word it self be english in dede, then is it best in the natural hew, 
if it be a stranger, &amp; incorporate among vs, let it wear our colors, sith 
it wilbe one of vs. In both the rules &amp; table, I haue rather sought, by 
such an induction to stir vp som other to perform the enterprise, then hoped 
my self to leaue it complet. For it maie so fallout, that I haue hit vpon som 
truth, tho not vpon all, &amp; again it maie so be, that I haue missed quite, 
&amp; cut a wrong course, &amp; yet by so doing, that I haue opened a waie 
vnto som other, by giuing such a light, either to amend my course if it like 
in part, or to shape a better by it, if it hollie mislike. Further, in both I haue 
bene verie carefull neuer to depart from the <hi>custom</hi> of my cuntrie, 
bycase I desire either to please with liking, or to mislike without 
displeasing. For where ane ordinarie <hi>custom</hi> doth seme of long time 
to haue made hir own choice, and that vpon good shew, she will either like 
him that cleaues to hir allowance, or not be displeased, where hir self is not 
misliked. And if there be anie hope to procure liking in such a thing as 
<hi>custom</hi> is to rule, it must nedes com by following, and not by forcing. 
He enforceth, which quite altereth the common currant <pb n="227"/>
allredie admitted in generall vse, both of ordinarie letter, and 
customarie writing, he foloweth, which marketh that waie wherein 
<hi>custom</hi> is most conuersant, and pleaseth it self best vpon likeliest 
presumptions: and withall obserueth wherein anie error intruding vpon 
<hi>custom</hi>, by ignorant hands, maie be easilie stript, and yet 
<hi>custom</hi> left clean to hir allowed direction. This following of 
<hi>custom</hi>, with considerate obseruing is a case of great hope, that the 
thing maie like, which is so laid down, bycause in like attempts it hath 
allwaie taken place, and bewraid hir successe by winning hir desire. 
Enforcing to the contrarie, or altering to far is almost desperate, if not 
altogither, bycause it hath alwaie mist, with losse of labor where it offered 
seruice. What my self haue won, by desiring to follow the custom of my 
cuntrie, &amp; no where to enforce it, it must appear in time, which while it 
do, I must craue relefe of curteous construction, &amp; submit my self to 
iudgement of those which can discern.

               <head>Of the natur of an Elementarie institution.</head>
               <p>AS in dealing with the ortografie of our English tung, I haue dwelt verie 
long, bycause the argument is new, tho the handling be old, so in all the rest, 
I purpose to be short, bycause the arguments be old, tho the handling be new. 
Wherein I will kepe that same course whereunto I am led by the natur of an 
institution, which is, to enter the learner so far, as he maie cumpas with 
ease all that which followeth in the same kinde, if his institution be 
perfited. Hence cummeth it that so manie boks in the latin tung bear the 
name of institutions bycause theie enter the young and vntrauelled student 
into that profession whereunto theie belong. Now in the framing of a good 
and proper institution, which must be both naturall to the profession 
wherevnto it entreth, and appropriate to the learner, which it must enter: 
there be two considerations chefelie to be had, the one is of what 
<hi>cumpas</hi> the profession maie be, whom the institution leadeth, the 
other of what <hi>kinde</hi>. In the <hi>cumpas</hi>, we consider the vse 
thereof to direct our life, whether it stretch far, or but som small waie. In 
the <hi>kinde</hi> we consider <pb n="228"/>
whether it be more in action, and lesse in contemplation, or contrariewise. 
For according to these two considerations the institution must be fashioned. 
Bycause the professions of <hi>diuinitie, law</hi> and <hi>physik</hi>, be of 
themselues verie large, for varietie of matter, and in vse verie nedefull, for 
their generall seruice, their institutions therefor ar commonlie great, as a 
fair gate doth best beseme a sumptuous pallace. The other faculties and 
Arts, as of argument vnder these, so of consequence lesse then these, nede 
but short institutions, as a litle dore doth best fit a pretie small bilding. 
Again, where the end of anie art, is hollie in doing, the institution wold be 
short, for hindering of that end, by holding the learner toto long in musing 
vpon rules, as in our <hi>grammer</hi>, which is the institution to speche, 
there wold be no such length as is commonlie vsed, bycause the end thereof 
is to write and speak, which when we do most, we learn our grammer best, 
being applyed to matter, and not clogd with rules. As for the vnderstanding 
of writers: that cums by years and ripenesse of wit, not by rule of 
grammer, anie otherwise then that grammer helpeth to the knowledge of 
tungs, whereby we vnderstand the arguments hid in them. But I will then 
handle these things, when I deal with grammer, next after mine elementarie. 
In the mean while that rule of <hi>Aristotle</hi> must be preciselie kept, 
whereby we ar taught, that the best waie to learn anie thing well, which 
must afterward be don, when it is learned, is still to be a doing, while we be 
a learning. In this last kinde, whose rule is, to be short in precept, and much 
in practis, is this hole Elementarie, and therefor, I am to deliuer som pretie 
and few rules, pikt out of the verie substance of ech principle, which to 
kepe in practis, and then to set down, som well chosen presidents, 
whereupon to practis, neither laing on to much, to passe an institution, 
neither leauing out to much, to com to short of it, neither vsing but the best, 
to work the best effect. For an institution ought to be in lineament like the 
hole, as the infant to his parent, tho not so full grown, in working forcible 
as a strong renet in ech part pithie to sprede full in all, without anie defect, 
when it is to perform, least it proue it self lame, for not preuenting that, 
where the lamenesse appeareth: which wold not appear <pb n="229"/>
if either the institution it self had bene perfit, or the following of it 
full. For the failing that waie is oft in the institution, being not perfitlie 
made, but either swelling to much, or spent in to small, or not properlie 
cast: but it is more oft in the trainer himself, which cannot perform that, 
that is periftlie set down. But least I proue long while I promis shortnesse, 
I will streight waie in hand with my first principle, which is that of 
<hi>Reading</hi>, wherein I will first appoint certain notes to direct the 
reader, and after som presidents, which seme fittest to be red. This treatis 
concerning the right writing of our English tung, tucheth the teacher and 
grown men more, out of the which I will still collect by waie of precept, and 
a short epitome so much as shalbe necessarie for the young reader, to help 
his spelling, or the young writer to direct his hand right, ear I deal with the 
two principles.

            <head>THE PERORATION</head>
            <p>To my gentle readers &amp; good cuntriemen WHEREIN MANIE THINGS 
AR HANDLED, CONCERNING LEARning in generall, and the natur of the 
english and foren tungs, besides som particularities concerning 
the penning of this and other books in English. 


</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MY good cuntriemen and gentle readers, you cannot possiblie haue anie 
more certain argument of the great desire, which I haue to please you, and 
the earnest care, which I haue to win your liking, then this verie speche 
directed vnto you, and that of set <pb n="230"/>
purpos. For if I had trusted vnto my self alone, and had thought mine own 
iudgement sufficient enough, to haue bene the rule of my right writing, 
which when I had pleased, I should nede no further care, to content anie 
other, I might haue spared this pains in requiring your frindship, and haue 
left curtesie to som hope, tho it were in som hasard, which seing I do not, 
but few for your fauor and frindlie construction, my earnest care in sewing 
therefor, as in me it voids contempt of your iudgement, and confidence in 
mine own, so in you it maie work curtesie, and a fauorable minde toward a 
man so affected, and so desirous to please you, as I dout not but it will, 
seing care is my sollicitor, and curtisie yours. If I feared not that 
inconuenience which commonlie enseweth, where two speak in an vnknown 
tung, and the third standing by thinks himself despised, bycause he 
vnderstands not, I wold haue sollicited my request in the latin tung, bycause 
the kinde of people, which I reuerence most, and whose frindlie opinion I do 
couet most, both desireth and deliteth to be dealt with in that tung, as being 
learned themselues. But the vnlearned stander by must help with a smile, 
and is therefor to vnderstand the matter which is handled. Wherefor to 
content both, by contemning neither, I will go on in that tung wherein I first 
began, and by a mean known to both, seke frindship of both: seing my desire 
is, as to profit the ignorant, so to please the cunning. But before I do moue 
anie particular request to anie or all of you my good cuntrimen, I must nedes 
enform you in the state of my cause, that perceiuing all circumstances you 
maie yeild with more fauor, when the motion shalbe made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The verie first cause, which moued me first to deal in this argument, and to 
venter vpon the print, whereof I stood in aw for a long time, and neuer durst 
com near it, till now of late, was to do som good in that trade onelie, 
wherein I haue trauelled these manie years, and by vttering my experience in 
the train to learned tungs, to lighten other mens labor, bycause I had espied 
som defects that waie, which craued som supply. But the consideration 
thereof being once entered my head, did sprede a great deal further then I 
dreamed on at the first, and wrought in me the like impression, for the right 
teaching of the learned tungs, that the inquirie for</hi> iustice <hi>in things 
of common life did somtime work in that renouned</hi> Plato. <hi>For</hi>
Plato <hi>seking to define</hi> Iustice, <hi>and <pb n="231"/>
what that is, which we call right in ciuill doing, could not deuise how to set 
them down in certain, by waie of definition, bycause theie were respectiue, 
and stood vpon circumstance in regard to other, before he had described a 
form of common gouernment, which when he had don, he streight waie found 
out, that that was iust, which was iump with ech state, as the state was 
appointed, whether perfit or vnperfit (tho the perfit were the best) and that 
procured in the state, &amp; proued to be an instrument of discord and 
decaie. The execution of the first, which preserueth the state, he 
termed</hi> iustice: <hi>the enormitie in the second, which seketh to vndo, he 
called iuiurie and wrong. The reason which moued him to take that course in 
finding out of</hi> iustice,<hi> and to make the anatomie of ane hole 
gouernment the mean, to know that rule, which leadeth ech gouernment, 
was, bycause the proportion, the vse, naie the verie substance of anie 
particular member, is neuer so known, as it maie be throughlie perceiued, 
and preciselie serueied vntill the hole it self, be exactlie known, whereunto 
the part answereth in proportion, in vse, naie in the verie substance.</hi>
Iustice <hi>concerneth euerie two, betwene whom there maie be 
entercourse, traffik, dealing, or doing anie kind of waie, whether prince and 
prince, prince and subiect, or subiect and subiect, whether one with one, or 
one with mo, or mo with mo. Naie it tucheth nearer. For where respects 
maie take place, there one maie do wrong to his own soul and bodie, as in 
pining the bodie, and entreating it euil, in tormenting the minde, and 
wringing it to the worst, contrarie to the rule of both religion and reason. 
Wherefor that hole bodie, which comprehendeth these circumstances, and 
respects in ech part, was nedelie to be described, before the particular 
effects, and the regiment thereof could possiblie be defined. This course 
took</hi> Plato <hi>and thereby found out that, which he desired to know.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My self entending at the first to deal but with the tungs, and the teaching 
thereof in the grammer school, (as he thought of his</hi> iustice <hi>in ciuill 
doings, ) was likewise enforced by swaie of meditation to enter in thought 
of the hole course of learning, and to consider how euerie particular thing 
did arise in degre, one after another. For without that consideration, how 
could <pb n="232"/>
I haue discerned where to begin, how to procede, and where to end, in anie 
one thinge, which dependeth vpon a sequele, and marcheth from a principle, 
seing the matter which I deal with, is a matter of ascent, wherein euerie 
particular, that goeth before hath continewall respect to that, which 
cummeth after, if the hole plat be artificiallie cast? As in this course of 
mine, the Elementarie principles maie resemble the first groundwork: the 
teaching of tungs the second stories: the after learning the vpper bildings. 
Now as in</hi> Architecture <hi>and artiviciall bilding, he were no good 
workman which wold not cast his frame so, as ech of the ascents might be 
conformable to other: so in the degrees of learning, it were no masterlie 
part not to obserue the like, which cannot be obserued, before the hole be 
thought on, and thoroughlie fashioned in the parties minde, which pretendeth 
the work.</hi>Plato <hi>in his platform for the finding out of iustice hath two 
great vantages of me. For both himself was so learned, as he is left to 
wonder, and his plat is in form, not fashioned for practis: whereby both his 
own autoritie giueth credit to his work, and his work kepes countenance, 
being not chekt by practis, which is able to ouerthrow euen the best 
meditations, being vnfit for perfomance tho bewtifull to behold by waie of 
contemplation. My knowledge being but of ordinarie compas is subiect to 
controllment of euerie better learned, naie it is not exempt from the round 
carping, euen of the verie meanest, from whose sting not euen</hi>Plato 
<hi>himself was able to escape. My labor is so laid, as it professeth practis, 
and is so to be reproued if it bide not the performance. Again his great 
sufficiencie laid all down at once, and gaue a full view of his hole platform, 
tho but in generall shew: this enterprise of mine cannot procede in that 
order, tho I could perform it as well as</hi> Plato <hi>could his bycause it 
mounteth still vp by waie of progression from one pece to another &amp; 
multiplieth infinite bycause of varietie in parts, which kinde of attempts 
abideth no one form aspectable at once, as</hi> Aristotle <hi>reasoneth, 
bycause of first &amp; last, which fal not in view togither at one time. 
Things of order be known by degrees, matters of staie ar to be sene at once, 
which cannot be in this argument, being in order of consequence, in number 
of multitude. For when ye ar once past the Elementarie train, be not tungs 
of som number, where the learner hath desire, not to rest vpon som certain? 
when ye ar past the tungs, is not the after learning of infinit <pb n="233"/>
branches, tho the main be within compas? Wherefor as in depenesse of 
meditation I drew like to</hi> Plato <hi>, tho in depth of iudgement but his 
fleting follower: So in order of deliuerie I depart from him and vtter my 
wares by retailing parcels, which he did ingrosse: when I had considered the 
generall ascending method of all learning, which while it is in getting, 
mounteth vp by degrees, but when it is gotten, doth sprede through out the 
state as sinews, veins, and arteries do through a naturall bodie, and withall 
maintains the state in full proportion of his best being, no lesse then the 
other do maintain the bodie, me thought I did perceiue some great blemish in 
the hole bodie of learning, as</hi> Plato <hi> no doubt, in the ripping vp, of 
right did find to be in gouernment. And as</hi> Plato <hi>himself by his own 
teaching did confirm his own precepts, whereby he brought forth a number 
of rare men, as euen the sharp</hi> Aristotle, <hi>&amp; the eloquent</hi>
Demosthenes, <hi>and by his singular plat of chosen gouernment, tho not all 
waie pleasing our religion and practis, did direct the best conceits of the 
most studious people: So for my simple skill in the same course, I haue 
armed my self, what so euer I shall set down by waie of precept, for the 
furtherance of learning, and hir recouerie from blemish, to practis it my 
self, with that successe in schooling which it shall please god to blesse in 
me and mine, for president to others, who will follow the plat, and with 
that allowance in writing, which my gentle reader shall bestow vpon it. For 
the plat of mine Elementarie, and what I haue vndertaken for the penning 
thereof, it is fullie declared in the eleuenth title of this same book: For the 
performance thereof in the bringing vp of children, I haue all the principles 
there named on foot, within mine own house, vnder excellent maisters. 
Wherein I do more then mine Elementarie requireth. For mine Elementarie 
course is to haue the principles perfited, before the childe deal with 
grammer: Mine execution now is by finding out of times, without losse of 
learning (which I maie easilie do hauing the hole train within mine own 
sight) to help those principles forward in such children, as wanted them 
before, or had som vnperfit, &amp; are willing to learn them by apointment 
of their parents, and my prouision. Which doing maie serue me for two 
proues, first, that all the principles maie be well learned singlelie, in their 
naturall order, when by waie of prouision theie maie be well compased 
iointlie with the tungs. Secondlie, that it is a great thing, <pb n="234"/>
which maie be performed in the Elementarie train, where, conuenient place 
contnueth all the doings within the masters sight, and the not chaunging of 
schols for diuers things, doth assure the profit without losse of time, or 
lingring by the waie. But to leaue speaking of the Elementarie execution and 
to return to the pen and the platting of this my writing course vpon this 
consideration, which caried me thus on after I had conceiued both where the 
blemishes laie: which disfigured learning, &amp; how to redresse them by 
waie of aduise to others, but in effect &amp; dede for mine own charge, I 
cam down to particulars: And began to examin, euen from the verie first, 
what went before the tungs in their orderlie trade of bringing vp children 
from there first schooling: which thing alone was my first impression in 
conceit, ear I fell to further thoughts: and my last resolution to the with 
more aduice, when I had thought vpon the most. This examining of the hole 
fore train I took vpon me so much the rather bycause I perceiued a great 
vntowardnesse in the learning of tungs, thorough som infirmities in the 
Elementarie grounding, which went before them. As what a toil it is to a 
grammer maister when the young infant which is brought him to teach, hath 
no Elementarie principle so grounded in him, as it maie bear a bilding? 
Wherefor considring the learned tungs do require a fundation, and carefull 
teachers som help of foretrain, I vndertook to rip vp all those things which 
concern the Elementarie, a degre in teaching before the grammer train, by 
mine own trauell to ease a multitude of masters. Which Elementarie degre, 
bycause it tucheth such learners as ar not entred into latin, &amp; wisheth 
well to such teachers, as be lightlie vnlearned, but in their own mediocritie: 
I thought it my best to publish it in that tung which is common to vs all, 
both before &amp; after that we learn the latin. Vpon which resolution I 
began with my first book, which I call</hi> Positions <hi>in the english tung, 
&amp; so procede in this next, which I term an Elementarie, as it is in dede, 
bycause it conteineth al those Elements or principles, which children ar to 
deal with ear theie passe to grammer, &amp; the learning of tungs, a book 
deuided into parcels, to lighten the price, tho but one in volum, distinct for 
execution of seuerall arguments. For these occasions, &amp; to this end I 
ventured vpon the print to help the course of learning, in this my cuntrie, by 
helping of the trade which is vsed in teaching &amp; to help the trade of 
teaching, by beginning at the Elementarie grounds, and to help the 
Elementarie by vttering it in English.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In which my attempts, these thre questions, I do not saie ar, <pb n="235"/>
but I suppose maie, peraduenture be demaunded: first, what those blemishes 
be, which I haue espied in the main bodie of learning ane argument at this 
daie so narrowlie sifted by so much varietie, and so great excellencie of 
learned wits, as euerie kinde of learning, is now thought to haue recouered 
that worship, which it was in, euen then whensoeuer it was highest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondlie, why in the trade of teaching I do not content my self, with the 
president of som other, which in great number haue writen learned treatises 
to the same end, but toil my self with a priuat trauell, whose euent is 
vncertain, whereas the writers of this argument be both learned 
themselues, and therefor to be followed, and their successe known, which 
maie warrant assurance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdlie, if it be my best to handle a learned argument in the english tung, 
why I take so great pains, naie so curious a care in the handling thereof as 
the weaker sort, whose profit I pretend, naie as oftimes som other also of 
reasonable studie, can hardlie vnderstand the couching of my sentence, and 
the depth of my conceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>While I answer vnto these thy motions, I must praie your pacience, good my 
masters, bycause the things maie not be slightlie past ouer, and the 
satisfying of them, maketh waie to that sute, which I haue vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First for my generall care to the hole course of learning, I haue thus much to 
saie. The end of euerie particular mans doings, for his own self: &amp; of 
the hole common weal for the good of vs all, is so like in consideration, and 
so the same in natur, as the one being sene, the other nedes small seking: 
Euerie priuat man traueleth in this world to win rest after toil, to haue ease 
after labor, and not to trauell still as being a thing exceding vncomfortable, 
if so be it were endlesse. The soldyer warreth in priuat conceit perhaps for 
ease by welth, which he maie win by spoil: in publik shew he trauelleth for 
the ease of his cuntrie by waie of defense, and pretending peace. The 
merchant traffiketh in priuat conceit, to purchas priuat ease by procuring 
priuat welth: in publik shew he trauelleth for the common ease, to satisfy 
som wants in necessarie ware for the common nede. Generallie all men of 
what profession soeuer, as theie seke there own rest by the priuat in their 
doings, so theie pretend the publik by the generall end, wherein theie all 
concur. Whereby it appeareth that ease after labor is the common end of 
both priuat and publik, of both all <pb n="246"/>
                  <note> error in page numbering</note>
and som bycause euerie one in the naturall currant of all his doings hath as 
well a generall respect to the common quiet, which maintaineth his (priuat 
as a strong bodie doth a febler person) as vnto himself for to work his own 
rest, which is parcell of the publik, and not to part from it, for fear of 
further harm. Naie is our hole life here in this miserable world, anie other 
thing, then a toilsom course, to com to som rest? or is the life after this in 
gods blessed kingdom anie other thing, then an endlesse rest, after ending 
trauell to such peple as seke for it by the right means to com by it? And as 
in that rest the hole assemblie of the chosen faithfull is all at rest, as 
euerie particular: so in this trauelling course, the generall end of anie hole 
state is a blessed peace, the great benefit of a mightie protectour, as in the 
same state the particular end of euerie priuat person is a blessed 
contentment, the great benefit of a mercifull god. Whereby I take it to be 
most euident both in</hi> Philosophie,<hi> whence the first ground is and 
in</hi> Diuinitie <hi>whence the second is, that honest contentment and rest, 
is the priuat mans hauen, as an honorable quiet peace is the publik harbour.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now as both the priuat and publik end doth pitch in quietnesse after stir, so 
theie both haue the like means to compas their own quietnesse, which 
meanes if theie vse right, theie obtain their right end, if theie vse them 
wrong, as they wring by the waie, so theie work their own worst, by missing 
of their end. And in good sooth, were he not vnwise, which seing the mark, 
whereat he is to shoot, will of set purpos, shoot another waie? Who hauing 
mean to com to heauen, which he dailie wisheth, will hedlong to hell, which 
he semeth to abhor? The right mean vsed right is the waie to this good, a 
wrong mean, or a wrong right work the contrarie effect. As to continew in 
my former particulars, the soldiers mean to com to his end &amp; right 
quietnesse, is to vse honest wisdom, &amp; pollicie, for the sauing of 
himself from danger and death, to vse honest and wise menas, such as law 
of arms doth admit, to better himself in bootie &amp; spoil, with 
continewall eie to defend for whom he fighteth, to driue to peace and ease, 
after war and blood. The merchants mean to com to his end and right 
quietnesse is to vse honest deuises and trades, for enriching himself 
without infamie to the world, or taint to his conscience: to rest content 
with so reasonable a gain, which is the hire of his trauell, as his countrie 
maie allow, and good conscience <pb n="247"/>
not condemn, with continewall eie, neither to afflict the peple, and 
surcharge the state with the bringing in, of anie nedelesse to much, nor to 
rob the poor, and to rak the state, with the carrying out of anie nedefull to 
much. Generallie all mens mean to com to their right and resting end is, to 
vse that profession and calling, whereof theie haue made choice, after that 
rule in priuat, which anie honest religious conscience leadeth, and after that 
direction in publik which in honest plaine truth procureth ech mans right 
ease, by helping to preserue the generall peace. If these means do not 
procede thus, neither hath the soldyer but rest in the end, but falls in blood 
or anguish, neither hath the merchant his end, but dwells in hatred or 
miserie, neither hath anie profession the hoped end, but such publik 
blemishes, and such priuat corrosiues, as vniust dealings in euerie kind 
deserue to receiue, and mete with in the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now as all these particulars by their priuat mismeaning, work their own 
mischiefe, so by the same means they be mortall enemies to the common 
peace, which is supported in dede, by priuat good demeanour. What the 
particular mean of euerie trade is, to com to the right end, I am not to shew 
at this time, for them look vnto it, whom it particularlie tucheth. My 
consideration is generall, &amp; the publik mean is my care, which must be 
measured by the proper end. The publik end is said to be peace, gods great 
benefit is his most mercie, and his chiefe, naie his onelie charge in his new 
and last commandement, to them that loue him. Then those means both first 
to com by this end, &amp; when it is com by, to maintain it in state, must 
nedes be such directions, as ar for peace, and the quietnesse of a state, for 
the keping of concord and agrement, without anie main publik breach, both 
priuatlie in houses, publiklie in cuntries, &amp; generallie throughout the 
hole gouernment. These peaceable directions I call, and not I alone, by the 
single name of generall learning, comprising vnder it all the arts of peace, 
and the ministerie of tranquillite, a matter of great moment, being the 
onelie right mean to so blessed a main, as fortunat peace is, imparting the 
benefit of publik quietnesse, to euerie particular, as a generall fountain 
seruing euerie mans cestern by priuat quills and pipes, whose bodie if it be 
blemished it hindreth not a litle, as the infected water of a primitiue 
fountain, is not holsom where it is vsed, naie as the corrupt blood passing 
from the liuer poisoneth the hole carcasse. By the benefit of learning euen 
war <pb n="248"/>
it self a professed enemie to learning, bycause it is in fede with peace, is 
handled verie iustlie, and worketh peace at home by vniting of mindes 
against a common fo. So much the more deadlie enemies, to all humanitie, 
naie verie diuells in dede to all common good ar theie to be estemed, which 
working sedition within the bowells of a state disioint it at home, &amp; 
make it to to feble, either against outward fo, by waie of resistence, or to 
recouer it self by reconcilement at home. By this learned mean in ech kinde, 
all princes gouern all states: the main and generall by considerat &amp; 
graue counsellours, by wise &amp; faithfull iusticiaries: &amp; the 
particular branches for relligion &amp; souls by diuines, for diseased 
bodies, by physicians, for maintenance of right, &amp; voiding of wrong, by 
lawyers, for euerie particular help, by euerie particular professour, from 
euerie greatest to euerie meanest thoroughout the hole gouernment. A most 
blessed mean to a most blessed end, a learned maintenance of an heauenlie 
happinesse, in ane earthlie state, of an heauenlie constitution. And 
therefore anie error in this mean is a maim in dede, and deserueth to be 
thought on, as an hindrer to peace, and a pernicious defeater of the best 
publik end, beginning perhaps at a small sparkle, but encroching still and 
gathering strength, by confluence of like infection in som other parts, till at 
the last, it set all on fire, and brust out in confusion, the more to be feared, 
bycause it festureth ear it flame, and shroudeth it self vnder shew of peace, 
and so consumeth without suspition, wheras it might be staid if it 
professed enemitie, and stood with vs in terms. The misses and blemishes 
herein, as in all other goods, which profit vs by vsing them, consist either in 
to much, or in to litle, or in to diuerse, or in to dissensious, if dissension be 
not the greatest diuersitie, tho for teaching sake theie be seruered in terms: 
Shall I saie in my thinking of this argument for the ascent in learning from 
the first Elementarie, that methought I found all these four imperfections in 
the hole bodie of learning somwhere to much, somwhere to litle, somwhere 
to different, somwhere to dissensious, four great enormities in a peaceable 
mean, to brede great disease, and defyance to quietnes, first, with in a state 
in the gouerning dirrection, and then without by euident inflammation, a 
thing therefore to be thought on, not onelie by particulars in waie of moning, 
but also by magistrates for mean to amendment.</hi>
               <pb n="249"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For to much thus I conceiue, that as in euerie naturall bodie, the number of 
sinewes veins and arteries, for the quikning and motiue vse thereof is 
definite and certain: so in a bodie politik, the distriubutiue vse of learning, 
which I compare to those parts, is euerie where certain. And what soeuer is 
more then natur requireth in either of them, as in the one it bredes disease, 
so in the other it doth destruction, by breach of proportion, and so 
consequentlie of peace. In naturall bodies this to much appeareth, when one 
or mo parts engrosse them selues to much, &amp; feble the remnant: In a 
common bodie this to much for learning, is then to be espied, when the 
priuat professions do smell to much, and so weaken the hole bodie either by 
multitude of the professors, which bite sore, where manie must be fed, and 
haue but litle to fede on: or by vnnecessarie professions, which choke vp the 
better, and fill the world with toies: or by infinitnesse of books, which 
cloie vp students and weaken with varietie: or by intolerable swelling in 
the verie handling, which fatteh the carcasse, and febleth the strength of 
pithie matter. Be not all these surfets at this daie in our state? Be there 
not enemies to the common end, being growen out of proportion? be theie 
not worth the weing, &amp; wish theie no redresse? I saie no more, where 
it is to much euen to saie so much in a sore of to much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For to litle thus I conceiue. In a naturall bodie there is then to litle, when 
either som necessarie thing wanteth, or when that which is not wanting is 
to weak to serue the turn: And be not the same defects diseases in learning, 
and disquieters to a state? when necessarie professours want, either for 
number as to few, or for valew, as to feble? when shew is shrined, where 
stuf should be enstalled? when sound learning is litle sought for, but onelie 
surface, sufficient to shift with? When som necessarie professions, ar 
quite contemned, and laid vnder foot, bycause the cursorie student is to 
passe awaie in post? When want of nedefull books, bycause theie be not to 
be had proues a forcible let to greater learning: when such as we haue, be as 
good not had for insufficiencie in handling, and lamenesse to learn by? This 
corruption in learning anie man maie se, who is desirous to seke both for the 
maladie and the amendment. A breach of proportion, and therefore of peace 
to a publik bodie, which ought to be proportionate, a pining euil, which 
consumeth by staruing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For diuersitie in matters of learning, thus I think, that as it <pb n="250"/>
self procedeth from diuersities in abilitie, for bringing vp, for wit, for 
iudgement, for perfection, bycause either all or som of these four be a great 
deal finer in som then in som: so it worketh verie much harm in the peace of 
anie state, chefelie where the leaders thereof, tho theie fall not out, and do 
but vtter thear opinions yet deuide studies according to their fauorites, 
which consider not so much the weight of the arguments, as the liking of the 
autors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If this duiersitie do break out in earnest, as it hath commonlie don in our 
time, while the verie print it self being the instrument of necessitie, and 
the deliuerer of learning in the naturall and best vse, becommeth verie often 
to fre a mean for ambition in brauerie, for malice in enuie, for reuenge in 
enimitie, for all passions in all purposes, what a sore blow doth the common 
quiet receiue, whose mean to quiet, is made an instrument to distemper? 
For will not he fight in his furie, which brauleth in his books? seme not 
those mindes armed, naie arm theie not others to, by egging enimitie 
forward, to an open conflict, which in priuat studies enter combats with 
papirs? which by to much eagernesse make to much a do, in a stir better 
quenched to dy, then quikned to liue? which whet their wits before, to be 
wranglers euer after, and as much as lyeth in them, disturb the common 
case? nedelesse combats in matters of learning, be those which I mislike, 
the nedefull maie go on &amp; yet with no more passion, then common 
ciuilitie will allow, and christian charitie not condemn. To much 
ouerburdeneth, to litle consumeth, to diuerse distracteth, but to dissensious 
destroies. Your selues know my learned readers, what a wonderfull stir 
there is dailie in your schools thorough the dissenting opinions of som in</hi>
logik, <hi>som in</hi> philosophie, <hi>som in the mathematiks, Physik is 
not fre, tho</hi> Paracelsus <hi>were not fo, to those his humorists. The 
lawyer generallie is most quiet for contradictorie writing, bycause he gains 
not by it the thing which he sekes for: contrarie pleading at common bars, 
is a better pastur for a lean purse then a bissie pen to publish controuersies. 
The dissension in diuinitie is fierce beyond Gods forbid, &amp; so much the 
more, bycause it falls out often, that the aduersarie parties entermingle 
their own passions with the matters, which theie deal in. For as our own 
arguments of controuersie in cases of relligion do somtimes require a 
necessarie defense, so theie be oftimes such, as maie be well compounded, 
if mens affections would abide as much water to coul, as these bring fire, 
to enflame. <pb n="251"/>
But in the mean while how is the common peace disturbed, by the 
dissensious writhing of a worthie mean, to maintain a wrong, and to becom 
slaue to som in ordinate passion? I enter not this argument, to stand long 
about it, but in natur of a passage to let my good reader vnderstand, how 
much my desire was encreased, to the furtherance of learning, after I had 
markt these inconueniences, whereas at the first I ment no more but onelie 
the help of teaching the learned tungs. The agrement of the learned 
generallie, is mother to contentment generallie: By carping or contrarying, 
theie trouble the world, and taint themselues, bearing the name of 
Christians, which verie title enioyneth a serch to avoyd contention, euen by 
submission of the wronged: neither chargeth it vs to defend our religion 
with passionat mindes, but with armor of pacience, and appointment of 
truth sufficient to confute, euen bycause it is trew, not neding our 
affections, wherewith it is trubled.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>These were the blemishes which I saw by the waie in the bodie of learning, 
which as I did moue, so I wished the amendment, which amendment resteth 
vpon two great pillers: The professurs of learning to giue intelligence of 
the error, and the principall magistrates, naie the verie souerain prince, to 
cause the redresse in so necessarie a pece, as the course of learning is, 
being Gods great instrument to work our quietnesse for souls, bodies, goods, 
and doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The prince maie take order to cut of that is to much, to make vp that is to 
litle, to vnite diuersities, to expell dissensions, whose lawfull autoritie is 
a great commander, and no where more then in a generall good, where euerie 
one will follow, bycause euerie one is bettered. If it com not from the 
prince the more maie continew, the amendment is consumed. Which 
proueth</hi> Platoes <hi>sentence, to haue kings</hi> filosofers, <hi> that is, all 
magistrates learned, to be maruellous requisite in anie good gouernment. It 
is a great corrosiue to the hole prouince of learning, which is the regiment 
of peace, where such as must direct, ar but experienced wise, tho that be 
verie much, but yet both experience, and learning togither make the better 
consent. It is an honorable conceit besides the incredible good, for a learned 
vertewous prince by the assistence of a like counsell, to reduce the 
professours of learning, by choice in euerie kinde to a certain number, to 
make choice in points of learning necessarie for the state, to appoint out 
books for learning, both in multitude not to manie, <pb n="252"/>
and in method of the best. The president is princelie, in euerie 
profession &amp; not onelie now moued. There hath bene stripping 
heretofore in all these kindes, both by consent of the learned and by 
commandement from good princes. Our cuntrie is small, the thing the more 
easie our liuings within compas, the thing the more nedfull: the enormitie 
great, the lesse able we to beare it: our prince learned, the liker to giue ear: 
our peple of vnderstanding, the better able to enform her. But neither doth 
the physician thriue so, by taking vp of contentions, nor the diuine prosper 
so in a heauen, where all is good, as he doth in earth where, all is euill tho 
the best in ech kinde do honor them most: And therefor profit wilbe 
followed, tho it be with confusion, redresse will not stir, bycause it iudgeth 
the world, to be in som falt, which it is loth to confesse. Howbeit to 
procure som redresse and help this waie, at the Princes hand, it standeth all 
them in hand, which make profession of learning, if theie do but consider the 
reputation of learning in these our daies, whether by insufficient 
professours, or contemned professions.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the professours of learning, to whose solliciting this point is 
recommended, there be two things chefelie required. First that theie studie 
soundlie themselues vpon stuf worth the studie, in order of right ascent, 
with mindes giuen to peace. For sound learning will not so soon be shaken at 
euerie eager point of controuersie, as the fleter will. Orderlie ascent 
groweth strong verie soon, &amp; a pacifik conceit is a furtherer to that 
end, which is both priuatlie minded, and publiklie intended. The consent of 
the learned, and their quiet inclination is a great blessing to anie common 
weal, but chefelie to ours in this contentious time, where the ouerwhetted 
mindes work verie small good to som worthie professions. The distraction 
of mindes, into sects and sorts of</hi> philosophie, <hi>did a mightie great 
displeasur to the quietnesse of that people, where the destraction fell as it 
did our religion more, which spreding in that cuntrie, where those sorts 
were nurished, was neuer in quiet sence.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second point required in a learned student is not so much to seke his 
own auancement, as the things, which he professeth, which if it take place, 
himself coms forward, bycause he hath the things. If he seke his own 
auancement, and either forget the thing, if he haue it, or care not for it, if 
he haue it not, the want of the thing <pb n="253"/>
will weaken his credit, tho it encrease hir own, as where the ignorant is 
blamed, there knowledge is allowed, tho the allower be not learned. He that 
studieth soundlie recommendeth good letters, by his own example: he that 
solliciteth other, who haue autoritie to further aduanceth them by 
aduiertisment, he that exerciseth his pen to help the best currant, 
confirmeth his desire by the doing thereof. In this last kinde mine own 
labor trauelleth to seke for vniformitie, to strip awaie the nedelesse, to 
supply som defects, to do mine endeuor to help euerie one in as quiet a 
course, as I can temper my stile vnto. And tho somtimes I do sprede vpon 
cause in length of discourse, yet for the matter it self, which I will 
commend to the learner, I wilbe short and sound enough, and leaue more to 
practis, then I will laie in precept. Thus much for the generalitie of 
learning, and the learned, to whose considerations I commit the sollicting, 
as to the magistrates the amendment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second question, which I said might be demanded of me, why I do not 
allow som learned president of those writers, which haue delt this waie 
with great admiration, maie be answered verie soon. I confesse the number 
of them, which haue writen of the training vp of children, to be so manie in 
number, as either priuat cuntrie or priuate cause might moue to deal in it. I 
confesse the excellencie of manie in that kinde, as</hi> Bembus, Sturmius, 
Erasmus, <hi>and diuerse other. But we differ in circumstance. A fre citie, a 
priuat frind, and an hole monarchie, haue diuersities in respect, tho theie 
agre in som generalls, wherein those writers dissent not from me. Neither 
do I but follow good writers, fetching my first patern from such writers, as 
taught all those to write so well, a thing alredie proued in the second 
chapter of this book. I am seruant to my cuntrie. For hir sake I trauell, hir 
circumstances I must consider, and whatsoeuer I shall pen, I will se it 
executed by the grace of God, mine own self, to persuade other the better by 
a tried prouf.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third question for my writing in English, and my so carefull, (I will not 
saie so curious writing,) concerneth me somwhat, bycause it beareth 
matter. For som be of opinion, that we should neither write of anie 
philosophicall argument, nor philosophicallie of anie slight argument in our 
English tung, bycause the vnlearned vnderstand it not, the learned esteme it 
not, as a thing of difficultie to the one, and no delite to the other. For both 
the penning in English generallie, <pb n="253"/>
                  <note>error in page numbering</note>
and mine own penning in this order, I haue this to saie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No one tung is more fine then other naturallie, but by industrie of the 
speaker, which vpon occasion offered by the kinde of gouernment wherein he 
liueth, endeuoreth himself to garnish it with eloquence, &amp; to enrich it 
with learning. The vse of such a tung, so eloquent for speche, and so learned 
for matter, while it kepeth it self within the naturall soil, it both serues 
the own turn with great admiration, and kindleth in the foren, which com to 
knowledge of it, a great desire to resemble the like. Hence came it to passe, 
that the peple of</hi> Athens, <hi>both bewtified their speche by the vse of 
their pleading, &amp; enriched their tung with all kindes of knowledge, both 
bred within</hi> Grece, <hi>and borowed from without. Hence came it to 
passe, that peple of</hi> Rome <hi>hauing platted their gouernment, much what 
like the</hi> Athenian, <hi>for their common pleas, became enamored with 
their eloquence, whose vse theie stood in nede of, and translated their 
learning, where with theie were in loue. Howbeit there was nothing somuch 
learning in the latin tung, while the</hi> Romane <hi>florished, as at this daie 
is in it by the industrie of students, thoroughout all</hi> Europe, <hi>who vse 
the latin tung, as a common mean, of their generall deliuerie, both in things 
of their own deuise, and in works translated by them. The</hi> Romane 
<hi>autoritie first planted the latin among vs here, by force of their 
conquest, the vse thereof for matters of learning, doth cause it continew, 
tho the conquest be expired. And therefor the learned tungs so termd of 
their store, maie thank their own people, both for their fining at home, and 
their fauor abrode. Wherevpon it falleth out, that as we ar profited by the 
mean of those tungs, so we ar to honor them euen for profit sake, and yet 
not so but that we maie cherish our own, both in such cases, as the vse 
thereof is best: and in such places, as it maie be bettered, tho with 
imparing of them. For did not those tungs vse euen the same means to braue 
themseues ear theie proued so beawtifull? Did the peple strain curtesie to 
pen in their naturall, euen these same arguments which theie had from the 
foren? If theie had don so, we had neuer had their works, whereat we 
wonder so.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There be two speciall considerations, which kepe the</hi> Latin,<hi> &amp; 
other learned tungs, tho chefelie the</hi> Latin, <hi>in great countenance 
among vs, the one thereof is the knowledge, which is registred in them, the 
other is the conference, which the learned of</hi> Europe, <hi>do <pb n="254"/>
comonlie vse by them, both in speaking and writing. Which two 
considerations being fullie answered, that we seke them from</hi> profit 
<hi>&amp; kepe them for that conference, whatsoeuer else maie be don in our 
tung, either to serue priuat vses, or the beawtifying of our speche, I do not 
se, but it maie well be admitted, euen tho in the end it displaced the</hi>
Latin, <hi>as the</hi> Latin <hi>did others, &amp; furnished it self by the</hi>
Latin <hi> learning. For is it not in dede a meruellous bondage, to becom 
seruants to one tung for learning sake, the most of our time, with losse of 
most time, whereas we maie haue the verie same treasur in our own tung, 
with the gain of most time? our own bearing the ioyfull title of our libertie 
and fredom, the</hi> Latin <hi>tung remembring vs, of our thraldom &amp; 
bondage? I loue</hi> Rome, <hi>but</hi> London <hi>better, I fauor</hi>Italie, 
<hi>but</hi> England <hi>more, I honor the</hi> Latin, <hi>but I worship the</hi>
English. <hi>I wish all were in ours, which theie had from others, neither 
offer I them wrong, which did the like to others, and by their own president 
do let vs vnderstand, how boldlie we maie ventur, not withstanding the 
opinion of som such of our peple, as desire rather to please themselues with 
a foren tung, wherewith theie ar acquainted, then to profit their cuntrie, in 
hir naturall language, where their acquaintance should be. It is no obiection 
to saie, well ye rob those tungs of their honor, which haue honored you? or 
which if theie had not bene to make you learned, you had not bene to strip 
them of from learning? For I honor them still, &amp; that so much as who 
so doth most, euen in wishing mine own tung partaker of their honor. For if 
I had them not in great admiration, bycause I know their valew, I wold not 
think it to be anie honor for my cuntrie tung to resemble their grace. I 
confesse their furnitur and wish it were in ours, which was taken from 
other, to furnish out them. For the tungs which we studie, were not the 
first getters, tho by leerned trauell the proue good kepers, and yet readie to 
return and discharge their trust, when it shalbe demanded in such a sort, as 
it was committed for term of years, and not for inheritance. And therefor 
no disgrace where theie did receiue with condition to deliuer, if theie do 
deliuer, when theie ar desired. But a dishonor to that tung, which hath a 
deliuerie both deuised and tendered, and will not receiue it. From which 
dishonor I wold</hi> English <hi>were fre, and that learning receiued, which is 
redie to be deliuered. I confesse their good fortun, which had so great a 
forestart, before other tungs as theie be most <pb n="255"/>
welcom, wheresoeuer theie set foot, &amp; allwaie in wonder aboue anie 
other for their rare worthinesse: which haue all mens opinions concerning 
other speches, in such a captiuate preiudice of their own excellencie, as 
none is thought anie, but when it is like to them, and yet the most like to be 
maruellouslie behind.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The diligent labor of learned cuntrimen did so enrich these tungs, and not 
the tungs them selues, tho theie proued verie pliable, as our tung will proue, 
I dare assure it of knowledge, if our learned cuntriemen will put to their 
labor. And why not I praie you, as well in</hi> English, <hi>as either in</hi>
Latin <hi>or anie tung else?</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will ye saie it is nedelesse? sure that will not hold. If losse of time while 
ye be pilgrims to learning by lingring about tungs, be my argument of nede: 
if lak of sound skill, while the tung distracteth sense, more then half to it 
self, and that most of all in a simple student or a sillie wit, be no argument 
of nede, then saie you somwhat, which pretend no nede. But bycause we 
neded not, to lease anie time onelesse we lifted, if we had such a vantage, 
in the course of studie, as we now lease, while we trauell in tungs: and 
bycause our vnderstanding also, were most full in our naturall speche, tho 
we know the foren excedinglie well, methink</hi> necessitie <hi>it self doth 
call for</hi> English, <hi>where by all that gaietie maie be had at home, which 
makes vs gase so much at the fine stranger.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ye will saie it is vncouth. In dede being vnused. And so was it in</hi>
Latin, <hi>and so is it in ech language, &amp;</hi> Tullie <hi>himself the</hi>
Romane <hi>paragon, while he was aliue, &amp; our best patern now, tho he be 
dead, had verie much ado, and verie great wrastling against such wranglers, 
and their nice lothing of their naturall speche, ear he wan that opinion, 
which either we our selues haue now of him, or the best of his frinds did 
them conceiue by him. Is not euerie his preface before all his philosofie 
still thwakt full of such conflicts, had against those cauillers? our</hi>
English <hi>wits be verie wel able, thanks be to God, if their wils were as 
good, to make those vncouth &amp; vnknown learnings verie familiar to our 
peple, euen in our own tung, &amp; that both by president &amp; protection 
of those same writers, whom we esteme so much of, who doing that for 
others, which I do wish for ours, in the like case must nedes allow of vs, 
onelesse theie wil auouch that which theie cannot auow, that the praise of 
that labor to conueie cunning from a foren tung into a mans own, did dy with 
them, not to reuiue in vs. <pb n="256"/>
But whatsoeuer theie saie, or whatsoeuer theie can saie to continew their 
own credit, our cuntriemen maie not think, but that it is our praise to com 
by that thorough purchace, and planting in our tung, which theie were so 
desirous to place in theirs, and ar now so loth to forgo again, as the farest 
flour of their hole garland, which wold wither soon, or else decaie quite, if 
their great cunning, were not cause of their continewance: and if our people 
also, were not more willing to wonder at their workmanship, then to work 
their own tung, to be worth the like wonder. Our English is our own, our</hi>
Sparta <hi>must be spunged, by the inhabitants that haue it, as well as those 
tungs were by the industrie of their people, which be braued with the most, 
and brag as the best.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it maie be replyed again, that our English tung doth nede no such 
proining, it is of small reatch, it stretcheth no further then this Iland of 
ours, naie not there ouer all. What tho? Yet it raigneth there, and it serues 
vs there, and it wold be clean brusht for the wearing there. Tho it go not 
beyond sea, it will serue on this side. And be not our English folks finish, as 
well as the foren I praie you? And why not our tung for spaking, &amp; our 
pen for writing, as well as our bodies for apparell, or our tastes for diet? 
But our state is no</hi> Empire <hi>to hope to elarge it by commanding ouer 
cuntries. What tho? tho it be neither large in possession, nor in present 
hope of great encrease, yet where it rules, it can make good lawes, and as 
fit for our state, as the biggest can for theirs, and oftimes better to, 
bycause of confusion in greatest gouernments, as most vnwildinesse in 
grossest bodies.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we haue no rare cunning proper to our soil to cause forenners studie it, 
as a treasur of such store. What tho? yet ar we not ignorant by the mean 
thereof to turn to our vse all the great treasur, of either foren soil, or foren 
language. And why maie not the English wits, if they will bend their wills, 
either for matter or for method in their own tung be in time as well sought 
to, by foren students for increase of their knowledge, as our soil is sought 
to at this same time, by foren merchants, for encrease of their welth? As 
the soil is fertile, bycause it is applyed, so the wits be not barren if theie 
list to brede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But tho all this be trew, yet we ar in dispare, euer to se ours so fined, as 
those tungs were, where publik orations were in ordinarie trade, and the 
verie tung alone made a chariot to honor. Our state <pb n="257"/>
is a</hi> Moanarchie, <hi>which mastereth language, &amp; teacheth it to 
please: our religion is</hi> Christian, <hi>which half repines at eloquence, and 
liketh rather the naked truth, then the neated term. What tho? Tho no 
English man for want of that exercise, which the</hi> Roman <hi>had, &amp; 
the</hi> Athenian <hi>vsed in their spacious and great courts, do proue a</hi>
Tullie <hi>or like to</hi> Demosthenes, <hi>yet for sooth he maie proue verie 
comparable to them in his own common weal and the eloquence there. And 
why not in dede comparable vnto them in all points thorough out for his 
naturall tung? Our brains can bring furth, our conceits will bear life: our 
tungs be not tyed, and our labor is our own. And eloquence it self is neither 
limited to language, nor restrained to soil, whose measur the hole world is, 
whose iudge the wise ear is, not in greatnesse of state, but in sharpnesse of 
peple. And tho foren excellencie were half in dispare, must our own best be 
therefor vnbeautified? It should not sure, it should pearch to the height, if I 
could help it. We maie aspire to a pitch, tho we passe no further. The 
qualitie of our</hi> monarchie <hi>wil admit trew speaking, wil allow trew 
writing, in both with the brauest, so that it do please, and be worthie 
praise, so that it preach peace, and preserue the state. Our religion 
condemns not anie ornament of tung, which doth serue the truth, and 
presumeth not aboue. Naie is not</hi> eloquence, <hi>which commonlie is 
caried from weight of matter, to folie in words, the great blessing of god, 
and the trumpet of his honor, as</hi> Chrysostom <hi>calleth</hi> S. Paule, <hi>if 
it be religiouslie bent? Theie that haue red the old church storie, do find 
that</hi> eloquence <hi>in the primitiue church, ouerthrew great forces, bent 
against our faith, &amp; enflamed numbers to embrace the same, when 
strength from the truth, ioyned with force in the word. Seke it to serue God, 
shun it to serue thy self, but where it serues thine own turn, with warrant 
from him.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But will ye thus break of the common conference with the learned foren, by 
banishing the</hi> Latin, <hi>and setting ouer her learning to your own tung. 
The conference will not cease, while the peple haue cause to enterchange 
dealings, &amp; without the</hi> Latin, <hi>it maie well be continewed: as in 
som cuntries the learnedder sort, &amp; som near cosens to the latin it self 
do alreadie wean their pens and tungs from the vse of</hi> Latin, <hi>both in 
writen discourse, &amp; spoken disputation, into their own naturall, and yet 
no dry nurse, being so well appointed by the milch nurses help. The question 
is not to disgrace the</hi> Latin, <hi>but to grace <pb n="258"/>
our own. And why more a stranger in honor with vs, then our own peple, all 
circumstances serued? And tho no stranger, nor foren nation, bycause of the 
bounder &amp; shortnesse of our language, wold deal so with vs, as to 
transport from vs as we do from other, bycause we deuise no new, tho we 
denison the old, yet we our selues gain verie much thereby, in the course of 
studie, to be set at the first in the priuie chamber or closet of knowledge, 
by the mere frindship of our cuntrie tung: as</hi>Iustinian <hi>the Emperour 
saith to the students in</hi> law, <hi>when he made his</hi> institutions <hi>to 
be of imperial force, that theie were most happie for hauing such a foredeal, 
as at the verie first to hear the Emperours voice, which those of elder time, 
did not attain vnto so soon, by the full term least of four hole years. And 
doth not our languaging hold vs bak four years, &amp; that full think you? If 
it hindered vs no more, tho it help vs verie much, the losse were the lesse. 
For the time it is most certain, that we ar hindered by tungs, tho we must 
harken vnto them, till we haue help at home. And that our best 
vnderstanding is in our naturall tung, if we minde &amp; mark it, who can 
deny, which is able to se, that all our foren learning is applyed vnto vse 
thorough the mean of our own &amp; without the application to particular 
vse, wherfor serues learning.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is pitie to deface such honorable antiquitie. No pitie forsooth to 
honor our own, doing no worse to them, then theie did to vs, by either 
spoiling our cuntrie, as all histories witnesse, or defacing our learning if 
the</hi> Celtopadie <hi>saie trew. O spare</hi> Babilon <hi> it is a fair town, 
saue</hi> Dianæs <hi>chirch, it is a fair temple, worship foren speche, for 
that ye maie take from it. Then be bond still to</hi> Babilon, <hi>then be</hi>
paganes <hi>still with</hi> Ephesus: <hi>then be still borrowers of the 
boroweres themselues. If this opinion had bene allwaie maintained, we had 
allwaie worn old</hi> Adams <hi>pelts, we must still haue eaten, the poets 
akecorns, &amp; neuer haue sought corn, we must cleue to the eldest and not 
to the best.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why not all in</hi> English, <hi>a tung of it self both depe in conceit, 
&amp; frank in deliuerie? I do not think that anie language, be it 
whatsoeuer, is better able to vtter all arguments, either with more pith, or 
greater planesse, then our</hi> English <hi>tung is, if the</hi> English 
<hi>vtterer be as skilfull in the matter, which he is to vtter: as the foren 
vtterer is. Which methink I durst proue in anie most strange argument, euen 
mine own self, tho no great clark, but a great welwiller to my naturall 
cuntrie. And tho we vse &amp; must vse manie foren terms, when we deal 
with such arguments, we do not anie more then the brauest tungs do <pb n="259"/>
&amp; euen verie those, which crake of their cunning. The necessitie is one 
betwene cuntrie &amp; cuntrie, for communicating of words, for vttering of 
strange matter, &amp; the rules be limited how to square them to the vse of 
those which will borow them. It is our accident which restrains our tung, 
&amp; not the tung it self, which will strain with the strongest, &amp; 
stretch to the furthest, for either gouernment if we were conquerers, or for 
cunning, if we were treasurers, not anie whit behind either the subtile</hi>
Greke <hi>for couching close, or the statelie</hi> Latin <hi>for spreding fair. 
Our tung is capable, if our peple wold be painfull. The verie</hi> Grekish 
<hi>soil, as it is noted by som, did fine</hi> Philelphus <hi>beyond all account, 
being an</hi> Italian <hi>born. The same <hi>Italie</hi> saith</hi> Erasmus, 
<hi>wold haue don the like in our</hi> Sr. Thomas More, <hi>if he had bene 
trained there. and maie not labor &amp; emploiment, work as great wonders 
in the English wits at home, as the air can do abrode? Is the alteration of 
soil, the best mean of growing, &amp; onelie the best? Naie sure, wits be 
sharp enough euerie where, tho where the trading is lesse, &amp; the air 
more grosse, the labor must be greater, to supply that with pains, which is 
wanting in natur. Which when ye haue don, then maie you be bold to take 
that two worded &amp; thriseworthie question,</hi> Quid non? <hi>to be your 
posie. but grant it were an heresie, seing our training vp is in the foren 
tungs, euen to wish all in</hi> English. <hi>Certainlie it is no falt to handle 
that in</hi> English, <hi>which is proper to</hi> England <hi>tho the same 
argument well handled in</hi> Latin <hi>were like to please</hi> Latinists 
<hi>pleasur, which is not for studies to plaie with, but for students to 
practis, &amp; there the better where euerie once can iudge: the principal 
benefit of our</hi> English <hi>penning. Besides all this to confirm a trew 
ground with a triall as trew, how manie sklender things, as oftimes vttered 
in the</hi> Latin <hi>tung, &amp; other foren speches, which vnder the bare 
vail of a strange couert do seme to be somwhat for to countenance studie, 
which if theie were</hi> Englished, <hi>&amp; the mask puld of, that euerie 
man might se them, wold seme verie miserable, &amp; make a storie shew 
of simple substance, &amp; be soon disclamed in of the parties themselues, 
with som thought at the least, of the old sauing.</hi> Had I wist, I wold not. 
<hi>and were it not then better to gain iudgement thoroughout in our own</hi>
english, <hi>then either to lease it, or to lame in the foren</hi> Latin, <hi>or 
anie tung else? To be led on a long time with the opinion of somthing which 
in the end will proue plane nothing, or but a simple somthing? These and 
such considerations concerning the foren &amp; our</hi> English <hi>tung make 
me thank the foren for my furtherance in <pb n="260"/>
points, but withall to think how to further my naturall. And therefor when 
occasion doth offer, as in these Elementarie points, I am verie well content 
to deal in English, not renouncing either</hi> Latin <hi>or other learned tung, 
when my ascent in writing shall require their vse.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now as this penning in English maie seme not impertinent to the vse of my 
cuntrie, vpon these and such grounds, so my to carefull penning maie perhaps 
offend som, as seming to obscure, and hindring my pretence by either 
writing to hard matters, for the ignorant to perceiue, or in to close a stile 
for mean heads to enter, or into rare terms, for plane folks to reach at. All 
which difficulties be verie great foes to the common mans perceiuing, who 
canst vnderstand but where he hath bene traned, and no good frinds to my 
purpos, who pretend that I write to profit the most, which is that of the 
vntraned and vnskilfull multitude. But tho these obiections make a verie 
probable shew, yet theie must giue me leaue to plead mine own cause, for 
both matter, maner, and term, bycause the thre difficulties be grounded vpon 
these three, and yet in all these, the answer is half made, bycause I mean 
my cuntrie tung well, and therefor tho I did try som conclusions, to work 
that in the hardest, which is easie in the softest, euen som insufficiences 
might seme pardonable, for that all which I do, concerneth my cuntrie youth 
and tung, it entertaineth hir profit, and enuieth not hir pleasur, and desireth 
to se hir enriched so in euerie kinde of argument, and honored so with euerie 
ornament of eloquence, as she maie vy with the foren, if I maie work it with 
wishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But first to examin that of hardnesse in matter, which the reader is said 
somwhat hardlie to vnderstand, and so after to the other, for the maner and 
word. Wherein I praie you doth that hardnesse consist, which is fathered 
vpon matter? Or rather doth not all hardnesse procede from the person, and 
none from the thing, not onelie in this case, but eueriewhere else? If that 
person which vndertaketh to teach, do not know the matter well, which he is 
to teach, to laie it so open, as it maie well be vnderstood, seing the best and 
first mean to plane opening, is perfit vnderstanding, is the thing therefor 
hard, which is not thoroughlie had? Or if that person, which should 
vnderstand, either do not in dede thorough mere ignorance, or cannot in dede 
through small knowledge, or will not of a will thorough som corrupt 
affection, is the thing therefor hard, which is so <pb n="261"/>
strangelie crost by infirmitie in the partie? Sure there is not. Sure there 
is no hardnesse in anie thing at all, which is to be deliuered by a learned 
pen, be it neuer so strange from the common vse, howsoeuer it be vnrightlie 
charged, to sheild negligence, if the partie deliuerer do know it 
sufficientlie, &amp; the partie receiuer be willing, &amp; not weiward. For 
what be those things, which we handle in learning? Ar theie not of our own 
choice? Ar theie not our own inuentions? Ar theie not the supplyes of our 
own nede? And was not the first inuentour, verie well able to open the 
thing, which he did inuent, before he did persuade it? Or did those men, 
which admitted the thing being inuented, make choice thereof before theie 
were instructed, wherefor it wold serue? Or could blunt ignorance haue won 
such a credit in a doutfull case, tho it pretended profit, to haue bene 
beleued, before it had perswaded by plane euidence? To haue the thing 
proued, ear it were perceiued, that it wold be profitable, not onelie for the 
present, but in time to com also, and that in euerie mans eie, which had anie 
foresight? If the first could do so both in finding and perswading, both in 
first admitting, and still continewing, his follower must do so, or be in falt 
himself, being not well appointed for sufficient deliuerie. If the partie 
which readeth do not conceiue the thing well, bycause he is ignorant, he is 
to be pardoned, the disease proceding from more infirmitie: But if he do not, 
bycause he will not, hauing abilitie to do, tho not with the most, he is 
punished enough by being peuish ignorant: if he can do with the best, &amp; 
will deal with the worst, blinded vnderstanding is the greatest darknesse, 
&amp; punisheth the ill humor with deprauing of reason, which should iudge 
right. If the partie deliuerer be himself weak, where mine own part coms 
in, being a deliuerer my self, he is either vnaduised, if he write ear that he 
know, or not well aduised if he mend not, where he misseth so he know 
wherein, and can tell how. Yet the readers curtesie is som couert against 
error, for him that writeth, as his pardon is protection for him, that 
readeth, if simple ignorance be their onelie falt, without further want or 
defect in good will. It fareth oftimes with readers in the iudging of books, 
as it doth with beholders in iudging of fauor, as it doth with tasters in 
iudging of relice. In the matter of fauor where louing is, all things be 
amiable, where lothing is, there nothing is liked, no not beawtie it self. But 
where affection is <pb n="262"/>
voided and reason in place, being able to iudge, there beawtie is beawtie, 
and deformitie is ill fauored, and euerie thing so weighted, as it is worth in 
dede. The like varietie is in matters of diet, a sikkish humor can relice 
nothing well, an ouergiuen delite likes nothing at all, but his own choice: 
and healthfull humor, and a right taste neither ouerlothes with siknesse, nor 
ouerloues with fantsie, but measureth what he tasteth with a right sense. 
And therefor in iudgement of fauor the corrupt opinion must be freid from 
passion: in discerning of iuyces the corruption of taste must be cleared 
from distemper: &amp; in matters of reason right information must be mean 
to right iudgement, or else that passion is to imperious, whom information 
cannot rule. Howbeit I fear not anie so strong a passion in anie my reader, 
and therefor I will on with my argument of hardnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Admit this diuision to be trew, that the hardnesse about matter either 
riseth of the thing it self, or of the handling. Is the thing hard saie you? 
Then is it such as is strange to the reader, either for difference of trade 
betwene the readers profession and the thing which he readeth, or for want 
of full studie, which marreth that in handling, that was neuer so studied, as 
it could be well handled. For the first, what affinitie is there in respect of 
their profession, betwene a simple plowman, a warie merchant, and a subtill 
lawyer? betwene manuarie trades, and metaphysicall discourses, either for 
the mathematiks, for physik, or for diuinitie? Again can anie thing at all be 
easie euen to students, who professe allyance, with the thing which theie 
studie, as the other do not, whose trades be mere fraud, if theie haue not 
trauelled sufficientlie therein? I nede saie no more but onelie this, that 
where there is no acquaintance in profession, there is no ease to help 
vnderstanding, where no familiaritie, there no facilitie where no 
conference, there no knowledge. If the man delue the earth, &amp; the 
matter dwell in heauen, there is no mean to vnite, where the distance is so 
great without compatibilitie. And whereas the vnderstanding in affinitie of 
trade is clear insufficient, there is far more hardnesse then in difference of 
profession, bycause vain persuation in such imperfitnesse brings much more 
error, then weak knowledge can work vnderstanding. In the ignorant 
vnacquainted there maie som good folow, if he begin to like, but the 
lukewarm learned doth mar his own waie by preiudicat opinion. But all this 
while, if there be anie difficultie about the matter, the mean is cause of 
hardnesse, which is in the man, and not <pb n="263"/>
the propertie, which is in the matter, and maie easilie be had, if it be 
carefullie sought. I am quik in teaching, and so hard to vnderstand, but to 
whom and why? To him forsoth that is not acquainted with such a currant, 
neither yet familiar to the matter so coursed. Well then, if want of 
acquaintance be the cause of difficultie, and supposed hardnesse, 
acquaintance once made and frindlie continewed will remedie that 
complaint, if the matter seme worthie the mans acquaintance in his naturall 
tung, for that is a question in a conceit blinded with the foren fauor, or if 
the partie be desirous to be rid of such a gest, as ignorance is, for that is 
another question, in a vain opinion ouerweining it self. For ane hole book 
being writen in</hi> English, <hi>and so manie</hi> Englishmen <hi> being so well 
able to satisfy euen at full the most ignorant reader in anie case of a book 
in that tung, it were to great discourtesie, not to lighten a mans labor with 
a short question, and as long an answer, but to pretend difficultie as a 
shadow not to seke, where the matter it self being no pleasant tale, nor anie 
amorous deuise, but an earnest argument concerning sober &amp; aduised 
learning, not acquainted with all readers, nor yet with all writers, doth 
protest no ease before it be sought, and deseruing to be sought, either for 
knowledge sake to instruct our selues, or for cuntries sake to enlarge hir 
speche, if it be not sought at all, and thereby not found, it doth bewraie an 
vnnaturall idlenesse, which desireth rather to find falt then ease. For what 
reason is it for one to labor to help all &amp;, none to list to help that one? 
naie for anie to list not to help himself from the danger &amp; bondage of 
blind ignorance? If the book were all</hi> Latin, <hi>&amp; no one word of the 
readers acquaintance, then the thing were desperate for a mere</hi>
Englishman <hi>to compas. Where as now anie man maie do it with verie 
small enquirie of his skilfull neighbour. Wherefor if anie thing seme hard to 
such an ignorant, as desireth to know, &amp; doth not know thorough the 
argument it self, being mere strang to his kinde of life he must handle the 
thing often, and so make it soft, where it semeth to be hard: and in 
questions of dowt confer with those, which ar cunning allredie. He must 
take acquaintance &amp; make the thing familiar if it seme to be strange. 
For all strange things seme great nouelties, &amp; hard of entertainment at 
their first arriuall, till theie be acquainted: but after acquaintance theie be 
verie familiar, and easie to entreat. And words likewise, which either 
conueie strange matters, or be strangers themselues, either in name or in 
vse, be no wilde beasts, <pb n="264"/>
tho theie be vnwont, neither is a term a</hi> Tiger <hi>to proue vntractable. 
Familiaritie &amp; acquaintance will cause facilitie, both in matter and in 
words.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the handling do seme to make the hardnesse, &amp; that doth procede from 
him which deliuereth &amp; penneth the argument, not onelie by opinion of 
the mistaking reader, but in verie plane truth also &amp; the soundest 
iudgmenets in that, whereof theie iudge, he is worthie to be blamed, which 
seketh to deliuer withowt sufficient studie: as again if it be not in him for 
insufficient handling, but in the corrupt reader for the plane 
misconstrewing, it deserueth small praise in him, that misconstreweth 
without either regard to curtesie, or reuerence to truth, or his own credit, 
if it proue contrarie, the partie misconstrewed being verie well able to be 
his own orator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning the maner, which I vse in writing, bycause the maner and the 
handling be so near cosens, as theie both be the pencills to deliuerie, if 
there be anie falt for hardnesse therein, that also procedeth of choice, being 
carefull to shew from whence I com, that is from the students forge, who 
being still acquainted with strong stele, and pithie stuf in reading of god 
writers, cannot but resemble that metle in my stile. In pening to proue 
close and allwaie with cause, and to cause that, which followeth to be 
sutable to that, which went before, to seke more for sinewes and sound 
strength, then for waste flesh, is semelie for a student, and chefelie there, 
where he penneth for perpetuitie, where the reader maie at leasur, either 
look vpon the book or laie it down by him, neither is so straited, as to read 
all at once, or to forgo the book: or to hear all at once, or to hear it no more, 
which is commonlie so in things but once handled in speche, &amp; in books 
that be vnwilling to bewraie their writer. Such discourses as be altogether 
popular, or vpon present dispatch, &amp; soon after to dy, maie well abide 
slight, bycause their life is short. And where theie ar to passe streight 
waie from the pen to present vse, and make no longer tariance then for such 
and such a feat, or when thei salute but the ear, and so to execution, without 
further delaie, then the more plane at sodain, the more plausible in dede, and 
therefor in their kinde verie excellent perfit. Bycause the matters being 
such as serue to that end, the vtterance must be such as maie work to that 
end, without anie thing to muse on, where there is no time to muse in. But 
where musing must be, &amp; the matter is no currier to passe awaie <pb n="265"/>
in poste, another currant must be kept, &amp; yet the maner of 
deliuerie must not be thought hard, nor be compared with the other, which is 
of anie other kinde, considering it teacheth, &amp; with such planenesse, as 
the subiect doth permit. Doth anie man of iudgement in learning, &amp; the 
Latin tung, think that</hi> Tullies <hi>orations &amp; his discourses in 
philosofie, were of like known, or of like planesse to the peple of Rome, tho 
either in their kinde, were allwaie like plane, as theie be to vs, which, know 
the Latin tung better then our own, bycause we pore vpon it, and neuer mark 
our own? no sure. To them theie were not, as it doth appear by verie manie 
places in</hi> Tullie <hi>himself, where he noteth the difference, &amp; 
confesseth himself that the newnesse of those arguments, which he 
transported from Greke, were cause of som darknesse to his common reader, 
and of som contempt to them, that were cunning, bycause of the Greke which 
theie fantsied more. Yet neither ignorance in the common reader, nor 
contempt in the learned could discourage his pen from the benefit of his 
tung, by translating their learning, which the other wished still to continew 
in Greke, he was desirous to conueie it to Rome, &amp; passed thorough with 
all, &amp; gaue time the turn, which in time turned to him, &amp; gaue him 
that credit which he still enioyeth vntill this daie. And that this was not 
onelie for the matter, whiche he wrote of, but also for the maner, which he 
vsed in writing, naie euen for the words, which the common man knew not, 
being artificiall and strange, he himself witnesseth.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I could write of these things, (meaning the arguments of philosofie) saith he 
like to</hi> Amasanius, <hi>naming som obscure apophthegmatarie discourser, 
but then not like my self, and as plane as he, but not to please my self, nor 
to satisfie the argument, as I should handle it. I must define, deuide, 
distinguish, vse Art, vse terms of Art, vse iudgement. I must as well mark 
from whom I fet my transported learning, that theie maie saie theie ment 
so, as for whom I set it, that theie maie saie theie vnderstand it. Whereof 
he doth not anie, and is there for thought plane, and soon sene of them, 
which se nothing far. For if plane humors must still be pleased, and be delt 
withall, so daintilie, as theie be put to no pains, to learn and enquire, where 
theie find difficultie, thorough their own not knowing. If theie must be 
made a lure for learning to discend to, in euerie kinde, and rather to 
degenerate hir self, then to desire them, to learn to look vp, what state 
standeth skill in? He that made the earth made hills and dales, made <pb n="266"/>
heights and planes, made smouthes and roughs, and yet euerie one good in 
their seuerall kinde. Planenesse is good for a pleasant course, and a popular 
stile in ordinarie argument, where no Art nedeth, bycause the reader knowes 
none, neither the matter is such, but it maie be so vttered, as being then in 
hir best colors, when she is drest for the common. Likewise this pretended 
hardnesse, tho it be proper to the matter, and the man which writeth 
without hardnesse in dede, hath hir peculiar good, to whet a wit withall, and 
to print depe euen bycause it semes dark, and contains a matter, which must 
be thrise lookt on, ear it be once gotten. Trauell is the coin, which is 
currant in heauen, for which and by which almightie God doth sell his best 
wares, tho of his great goodnesse, he do somtime more for som kinde of 
wits, in quiknesse and cunning, euen without great labor, tho not without 
anie, then anie labor can work in som other, to giue vs to wit, that his 
mercie is the mistresse, when our labor learns best. But in our ordinarie, if 
carpetting be knighting, where is necessarie defence? If easie 
vnderstanding be the rediest learning, then wake not my Ladie, she learns as 
she lies. If all things be hard, which euerie one thinks hard, where is the 
prerogatiue and benefit of studie? What helps it vs to studie not. I will not 
alledge, that the old learned men vsed darknesse in deliuerie in matters of 
relligion to win reuerence to the argument, as of another world, &amp; not 
of ordinarie speche neither that the old wisedom, was expressed by ridles, 
prouerbs, fables, oracles, and oraclelike verses, to draw on studie, and set 
that sure in memorie, which was soundlie studie for, ear it was so vttered. 
Be anie of our best and eldest writers, which we studie at this daie, &amp; 
haue ben thought the best, eche in their kinde, euer since theie wrote first, 
vnderstood at once reading, and at the verie first, tho he that studieth them 
do know their tung as well, as we think we know English, naie and better to, 
bycause it is more labored? or is their manner of penning to be disallowed 
at dark, bycause the ignorant reader, or the nice student maie not streight 
waie rush into it. That theie fell into that short &amp; close kinde of 
writing, euen for verie pith to saie much, where theie speak least, the 
commenting of them declareth, which openeth that with great length, which 
theie set down in som short sentence, naie in som short cut of no verie long 
sentence. Be not all the chefe paragons &amp; principall leaders in euerie 
profession of <pb n="267"/>
this same sort, vnpearceable for the common, tho in their common tung, but 
reserued to learning, as to store them that will studie?</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But maie not this dark falt, be in him that finds it, &amp; not in the matter 
which is plane of it self, and is plainlie vttered, tho it be not so to him? 
Our daintinesse deceiues vs, our want of good will blinds vs, naie our want 
of skill is the verie witch, which bereueth vs of sense, tho we pretend 
cunning &amp; countenance for learning. For euerie one that bids a book good 
morrow, is not therefor a scholler, nor a sufficient iudge of the book 
arguments. What if he haue studied verie well, but neither much nor long? 
nor once medled or not soundlie medled, with the argument whereof he wilbe 
iudge? What if desire of preferment haue cut of his studie in the midst of 
his hope, &amp; greatest towardnesse? Naie what if what not, where the 
means be so manie to work infirmitie? not withstanding either countinance 
in the partie, or opinion in the peple, do muster verie fare, for som shew of 
learning? Euerie man maie iudge well of euerie thing, which he hath studied 
well, &amp; practised full, (if the studie require practis), with all the 
circumstances that belong thereto. Pretie skill som one waie, and in som 
one thing, will somtimes glance at further matter, and shew som smak of 
further cunning, but no more then a smak, no further then a glance. And 
therefor in my iudging of another mans writing, so much of my iudgement is 
trew, as I am able to proue soundlie, if I were sadlie apposed by those, that 
can iudge: and not so much as I maie carie vncontrolled, either by pleasing 
my self, or som as ignorant as my self.</hi> Apelles <hi>could allow the 
coblers opinion, where his clouting was his cunning, but not an inch further. 
For my maner of writing, if I misse in choice, I misse with warrant still, 
rather minding the matter with substance, then the person with surface. 
For howsoeuer it be in speche, in that kinde of penning, which wilbe like to 
speche plane for plane argument, where performance must be present, &amp; 
deliuerie without delaie, certainlie where the matter must bide the tuch, 
and be tryed by the hammer of a learned resolution there wold be 
precisenesse, there wold be ordinat method, and deliuerie well coucht, 
euerie word bearing weight, &amp; euerie sentence being well, &amp; euen 
that will well weighed, where both time doth lend weing, and the matter 
deserues weing. Which kinde of writing tho it want estimation in som one 
age, by sleightnesse of the time, yet maie win it in another, when weight 
shalbe in price, as som hundreth years be writen <pb n="268"/>
both to shrine saincts and to autorise books.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the generall penning in the</hi> English <hi>tung, I must nedes saie this 
much, that in som points of handling by the tung, there is none more 
excellent then ours is. As in the teaching kinde no work memorie with 
delite, like the old leonine verses, which run in rime, it doth admit such 
daliance, with the letter, as I know not anie. And in that kinde, where 
remembrance is the end, it is without blame, tho otherwise not, if it com in 
to often, and bewraie affectation not sound but followed. In the staie of 
speche, &amp; strong ending, it is verie forcible and stout, bycause of the 
monosyllab, which is the chefe ground &amp; ordinarie pitch of both our pen 
&amp; tung. For fine translating in pithie terms, either pere to, or passing 
the foren quiknesse, I find it wonderfull pliable, and redie to discharge a 
quik conceit, in verie few words. For close deliuerie of much matter in not 
manie words generallie, it will do as much in the primitiue vtterance, as in 
anie translation. Which close deliuerie in few words maie seme hard 
somtimes, but onelie there, where ignorance is harbored, or idlenesse is the 
idoll, which will not be entreated to crak the nut, tho he couet the kernell. I 
nede no example in anie of these, whereof mine own penning, is a generall 
patern. Neither shall anie man iudge so well of these points in our tung, as 
those shall, which haue matter flowing vpon their pen, that wilbe so 
vttered, or will vtterlie refuse him, which refuseth that vtterance. For as 
in other tungs there is a certain propertie in their own dialect, so is there 
in ours, for our deliuerie, both as pretie and as pithie, as anie is in theirs.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the force of words, which was the third note and pretence of obscuritie, 
there ar to be considered.</hi> Commonesse <hi>for euerie man,</hi> beawtie 
<hi>for the learned,</hi> brauerie <hi>to rauish,</hi> borowing <hi>to enlarge our 
naturall speche, &amp; rediest deliuerie. And therefor if anie reader find 
falt with anie word, which is not sutable to his ear, bycause it is not he, for 
whom that word serues, let him mark his own, which he knoweth, and make 
much of the other, which is worthie his knowing. Know you not som words? 
why? no maruell. It is a metaphor, a learned translation, remoued from 
where it is proper, into som such place where it is more properlie vsed, and 
most significant to, if it be wel vnderstood: take pains to know it, you haue 
of whom to learn. It is not commonlie so vsed, as I do vse it, but I trust not 
abused, naie peraduentur in a more statelie calling, then euer you herd it. 
Then mark <pb n="269"/>
that the place doth honor the parson, and think well of good words, which 
tho you handle but with ordinarie lips, &amp; those somtimes foul yet in a 
fairer mouth, or vnder a finer pen theie maie com to honor. Is it a stranger? 
but no Turk, &amp; tho it were an enemies word, yet good is worth the 
getting, tho it be from your fo, as well by speche of writers, as by spoill of 
soldiers. And when the foren word hath yeilded it self, &amp; is receiued 
into fauor, it is no more foren, tho of foren race, the propertie being altered. 
But he nede not lak words, that will speak of words. Howbeit in this place, 
there nedeth not anie further speaking of them, neither which be common, 
neither which be bewtifull, nor which be braue, nor which be borrowed, nor 
that for anie ornament therein we giue no place to anie other tung.</hi>


            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For mine own words and the terms, that I vse, theie be generallie</hi>
English. <hi>And if anie be either an incorporate stranger, or otherwise 
translated, or quite coind a new, I haue shaped it as fit for the place, where 
I vse it, as my cunning will giue me. And to be bold that waie for either 
enfranchising the foren, or translating our own, without to manifest 
insolence, &amp; to wanton affectation, or else to inuent new vpon euident 
note, which will bear witnesse, that it fitteth well, where it is to be vsed, 
the word following smoothlie, &amp; the circumstance about bewraing, what 
it meneth, till oft vsing do make it well known, we ar sufficientlie 
warranted both by president &amp; precept of them, that can iudge best. 
Wherefor to saie that in plane terms, which I mean as planelie, he that is 
soundlie learned, will streight waie found a scholer: he that is well 
acquainted with a strong pen, whether in autors or in vse, will soon sift a 
close stile; he that hath skill in language, whether learned &amp; old, or 
liked and new, will not wonder at words which he knoweth whence theie ar, 
neither yet maruell at a conceit quiklie deliuered, the like whereof he 
meteth oft abrode. And therefor such skilfull men, as I fear not their 
iudgement, bycause cunning is curteous, so I praie their frindship, bycause 
their countenance is credit. For those that want of this, and cannot iudge 
right, tho theie be sharp censors, and commonlie vttering their talking 
talent, I must craue their pardon, if I passe not for their censuring, which I 
take for no iudgement. And yet I am content to bear with such fellowes, and 
pardon them their errors in my behalf, so theie that can iudge will pardon 
me mine in their curtesie. Those that neither can iudge right for want of 
cunning, nor maie seme to iudge wrong, for bewraing their <pb n="270"/>
own weaknesse, if theie desire to learn in anie case of dout, theie haue the 
learned to counsell, as the smatterer to corrupt. If theie like and allow, the 
profit is theirs, but if theie do not, theie fraie me not from writing, wherein 
I hope at length either to win their fauor, by deseruing well, or at least 
their silence, by cumbring them to much, tho I win not their fauor. Here to 
conclude in generall for the maner of writing &amp; words in our</hi> English 
<hi>tung, this is my opinion, that as for choice of argument to proue with, 
som verie near to the substance it self of that, which is in question, som 
further of, tho of probable seruice, there is regard to be had by him that 
proueth, &amp; if he do his dewtie, the thing is discharged, howsoeuer it be 
charged: so in the handling &amp; maner thereof, the like respect being had 
for both perspicuitie &amp; propertie to the thing, tho som one point seme 
strange, to the man that will iudge, the deliuerer is discharged. For either 
inuention of matter or elocution in words, the learned knew well, in what 
writers theie ly: and those that be vnlearned must learn to think of them, 
before theie think to iudge, least by missing the leuell, which the writer 
vseth, theie misse of that right, whereby theie should iudge. For the matter 
it self, which shalbe the subiect of anie learned method, as I haue said 
allredie, acquaintance will make it easie, tho it seme to be hard, as the 
maner also, tho it seme to be strange, if the thing it self, maie deserue 
acquaintance, which wil not appear before acquaintance. And a litle 
hardnesse yea in the most obscure, &amp; most philosophicall conclusions, 
maie neuer seme tedious to a conquering mind, such as he must haue, which 
either sekes himself, or is desirous to se his cuntrie tung enlarged, &amp; 
the same made the instrument of all his knowledge, as it is of his nedes. 
But I haue bene to tedious, my good cuntrimen &amp; curteous readers, 
&amp; yet not so, where no hast is enioyned, but to read at leasur, &amp; not 
all at once: now am I to moue my request vnto you, which I mentioned at the 
first, or your frindlie construction &amp; cuntrimanlike fauor. The 
reuerence to learning, which allureth the good student to embrace hir in his 
youth, &amp; auanceth him to honor, by hir presence in his age, will entreat 
the learned in generall for me, for endeuoring my self to recouer hir right, 
by whose onelie autoritie themselues be of account. The samenesse in 
profession will work me more fauour among my fellow teachers, then found 
emulation can work me discountenance: the fauorable side discouering good 
natur, and learning in dede: the peuish detracting, a beggerlie spite, &amp; 
som want of <pb n="271"/>
skill. The consideration of mine own present profession &amp; this last 
conceiued hope of the learned teachers doth put me in minde, to aduertis 
them in generall, of one speciall point, which in dewtie must moue them no 
lesse then me, to the carefull thought of redresse in our schools, which 
maie abide the amendment. I pretend not here relligion, which chargeth in 
conscience, neither yet priuat maintenance, which enforceth trauell, but 
onelie the munificence and that extraordinarie of our princes and 
parlements, towards our hole order in our cuntries behalf: who partlie by 
suffring vs to enioy old immunities, partlie by graunting vs diuerse other 
exemptions from personall seruices &amp; ordinarie paiments, wherewith 
our fellow subiects ar commonlie charged, both encourage vs to labor, &amp; 
binde vs to require them. For the continuance whereof, &amp; the assured 
enioying, all the teachers in England haue great cause to honor the right 
honorable</hi> Sr. Walter Mildmaie <hi>knight chancellor of hir maiesties 
court of exchequor &amp; one of hir maiesties most honorable priuie 
counsell. The right honorable</hi> Sr. Roger Manwod <hi>knight Lord chefe 
baron of hir maiesties court of Exchequor, the right worshipfull master</hi>
Robert Sute, <hi>master</hi> Ioyn chlinch, <hi>master</hi> Iohn Sotherton, 
<hi>Esquiers &amp; barons of the same hir maiestes court, the two first</hi>
Sr. Walter &amp; Sr. Roger <hi>great founders to learning both within the 
vniuersites, &amp; in the cuntries about them: the other thre Esquires great 
fauorers to relligion &amp; learning eueriewhere. For the small 
consideration, or rather the ouersight of som to passionat sessors in the 
last subsidie making that a priuat question, which was a generall priuilege, 
&amp; scant charitablie seking the damage of a number, by quarell to som 
few, it pleased these honorable &amp; worshipfull personages vpon humble 
sute for the common benefit of a number of poor men, to take the cause to 
protection, and to conster the statut, both as the parlaments did mean it, 
and as we haue still enioyed it, to the common benefit of our hole companie. 
Which their great goodnesse to the fauor of our order, as it deserueth at our 
hands an honorable remembrance, so it bindeth vs further to the common 
care, for the which we were fauored. Whereunto as I find my self to be 
maruellouslie affectionate, so dout I not but there is the like affection in 
manie of the same liuerie, whose frindship I carue, for fauorable 
construction, whose conference I desire for help in experience: being 
thankfullie redie in this common course, either to persuade on to be 
persuaded. Of those that ar not learned I praie frindship also, euen <pb n="272"/>
more then half of right: bycause I labor for them, in whom 
vnthankfulnesse is a falt, if my good will be none. In generall I desire but to 
win so much of all men, as</hi> Dauus <hi>in</hi> Terence <hi>desireth of his 
master when his good counsell had no good successe. Bycause I am your 
bondman (saith the slaue to his master) my dewtie is, to trauell hand &amp; 
foot, night and daie, yea with danger of my life to do you good, as common 
curtesie on the other side binds you, to hold me excused, to pardon and 
forgiue me, if anie my good meaning haue contrarie ishew, that I do maie 
misse, but yet I do my best. I am bond to my cuntrie, and bound to hir peple, 
I will do my best endeuor, and craue pardon with poor</hi> Dauus, <hi>where 
my best is begiled. Common curtesie is naturall, where there is no desert: 
forgiuenesse is relligious, euen where there is a falt: but where good will 
deserueth well, tho it fortun to fail, if fauor be not shewed, will not 
curtesie condemn, will not relligion repine? God blesse vs all to the 
auancement of his glorie, the honor of our cuntrie, the furtherance of good 
learning, the good of all degrees, both prince and peple.</hi>
