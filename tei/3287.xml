                  <l>PREFACE BY SAMUEL JOHNSON</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi rend="italic">It is to be observed of this play that, though its plan is irregular, it has been made instrumental to the production
of many discriminate characters who deliver themselves with candour and propriety, as they approach towards, or recede from,
the operations of Justice. The juxtaposition of Hamlet and Falstaff may be questioned by the learned or the delicate, but
the conjectural critic of an author neither systematic nor consequential can affirm that those same forces of natural
genius, which expatiate in splendour and passion, demand for their refreshment and sanity an abruptness of release and a
lawlessness of invention, proportioned to precedent constrictions. He only who hath never toiled in the anfractuous mines of
Philosophy or Letters, nor subdued himself to the ignoble needs of the Stage, will dispute the proposition.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi rend="italic">There is a tradition that this play was composed after a drinking bout. I would prefer to credit that it owed its
birth to some such concatenation of circumstances as 1 have adumbrated. The more so since, amid much that is ill-considered,
or even depraved, our author has assigned to the crafty and careless Falstaff an awful, if fleeting, visitation of
self-knowledge. Let us now be told no more of the illegitimacy of this play</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here’s all at an end between us, or I’ll never taste sack again. Prince or no Prince, I’ll not ride with him to Coventry
on the hinder parts of a carbonadoed stink, not though he call her all the car in Christendom. Sack! Sack! Sack!</p>
                  <p>HOSTESS. I spied her out of the lattice. A’ fizzled and a’ groaned and a’ shook from the bones out, Sir John, and a’ ran
on her own impulsidges back and forth o’ Chepe, and I knew that there was but one way to it when I saw them fighting at the
handles. She died of a taking of pure wind on the heart, and they be about her body now with tongs. A marvellous searching
perfume, Sir John!</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. He hath called me ribs; he hath called me tallow. There is no name in the extremer oiliness of comparisons
which I have not borne meekly. But to go masked at midday; to wrap my belly in an horse-hide cloak of ten thousand buttons
till I looked like a mushroomed dunghill; to be smoked over burnt oils; to be enseamed, moreover, with intolerable greases;
and thus scented, thus habited, thus vizarded, to leap out-for I leaped, mark you . . . Another cup of sack! But there’s
vengeance for my case! These eyes have seen the Lord’s Anointed on his knees in Chepe, foining with the key of Shrewsbury
Castle, which Poins had bent to the very crook of Nym’s theftuous elbow, to wake the dumb devil in the guts of her. “Sweet
Hal,” said I, “are all horses sold out of England, that thou must kneel before the lieges to any petrol-piddling turnspit?”
Then he, Poins, and Bardolph whose nose blanched with sheer envy of her bodywork, begged a shoulder of me to thrust her into
some alley, the street being full of Ephesians of the old church. Whereat I . . .</p>
                  <p rend="center">
                     <hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> PRINCE <hi rend="italic">and</hi> FLUELLEN</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. Whereat thou, hearing her once or twice tenderly backfire —</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. Heaven forgive thee, Hal! She thundered and lightened a full half-hour, so that Jove Himself could not have
bettered the instruction. There’s a pit beneath her now, which she blew out of thy father’s highway the while I watched,
where Sackerson could stand to six dogs.</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. Hearing, I say, her gentle outcry against Poins’ mishandling, thou didst flee up Chepe, calling upon the
Sheriff’s Watch for a red flag.</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. I? Call me Jack if I were not jack to each of her wheels in turn till I am stamped like a butter-pat with the
imprint of her underpinnings. I seek a red flag?</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. Ay, roaring like a bull.</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. Groans, Hal, groans such as Atlas heaved. But she overbore me at. the last. Why hast thou left her?— Faugh,
that a King’s son should ever reek like a smutty-wicked lamp upon the wrong side of the morning!</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. There was Bardolph in the buckbasket behind, nosing fearfully overside like a full-wattled turkey-poult from
Norfolk. There was Poins upon his belly beneath her, thrice steeped in pure plumbago, most despairfully clanking of chains
like the devil in Brug’s Hall window; and there were some four thousand ’prentices at her tail, crying, “What ho!” and that
she bumped. Methought ’twas no place for my father’s son.</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. Take any man’s horses and hale her to bed! The laws of England are at thy commandment, that the Heir should not
be made a common stink in the nostrils of the lieges.</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. She’d not stir for all Apollo’s team — not though Phæton himself, drunk with nectar, lashed ’em stark mad. Poor
Phæton!</p>
                  <p>HOSTESS. A’ was a King’s son, was a’ not, and came to’s end by keeping of bad company?</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. No more than a little horseflesh. I tell thee, Hal, this England of ours has never looked up since the nobles
fell to puking over oil-buckets by the side of leather-jerkined Walloons.</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. He that drives me now is French as our princely cousin.</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. <anchor xml:id="back1"/>Dumain? Hang him for a pestilent, poke-eyed, chicken-chopping, hump-backed,
leather-hatted, muffle-gloved ape! He hath been fined as often as he hath broken down; and that is at every tavern ’twixt
here and York. Dumain! He’s the most notorious widow-maker on the Windsor road. His mother was a corn-cutter at Ypres, and
his father a barber at Rouen, by which beastly conjunction he rightly draws every infirmity that damns him in his trade.
Item: He cuts corners niggardly and upon the wrong side. Item: He’ll look behind him after a likely wench in the hottest
press of Holborn, though he skid into the kennel for it. Item: He depends upon his brake to save him at need — a death-bed
repentance, Hal, as hath been proved ere this, since grace is uncertain. Item: He is too proud to clean the body of her, but
leaves the care of that which should be the very cote-armour of his mechanic knighthood to an unheedful ostler. Thus, at
last, he comes to overlook even the oiling; and so it falls that she’s where she must be, and not where thou wouldst have
her. Ay, laugh if thou wilt, Hal, but a round worthy knight need not fire himself through three baronies in eight hours to
know the very essence of the petrol<hi rend="sup">
                        <ref target="#foot1">1</ref>
                     </hi> that fumes him. Domain will one day clutch thee into
Hell upon the first speed.</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. Strange that clear knowledge should so long outlive mere nerve! I’ll dub Domain knight when I come to the throne,
if he be not hanged first for murder on the highway. ’Twill save the state a pension.</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. So the lean vice goes ever before the solid virtue, (<hi rend="italic">Confused noise without</hi>.) What riot’s afoot
now?</p>
                  <p>FLUELLEN. Riots, look you, by my vizaments, make one noise, but murders another. There’s riots in Monmouth; but, by my
vizaments, look you, there’s murders in Chepe. Pabes and old ’oomen — they howl so tamnably.</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. Rebellion rather! Half London’s calling on thy name, Hal, and half on thy father’s. Well, if it be successful,
forget not who was promised the reversion of the Chief Justice-ship. Ha! Unquestioned rebellion, if broken crowns signify
aught.</p>

Risen refreshed from her supposed stand<lb/>

                  <p>HERALDS. The blood upon our boltered brow attests<lb/>
’Twas Bardolph’s art that waked her, whereat she<lb/>
Skipped thunderously before our mazèd eyes,<lb/>
Drew out o’er several lieges (all with God!),<lb/>
Battered a house or so to lathes, and now<lb/>
Fumes on her side in Holborn. Please you, come!</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. Anon! Seek each a physician according to his needs and revenues. I’ll be with you anon. (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> FALSTAFF.)
The third in three weeks! These whoreson German clockcases no sooner dint honest English paving-stone than they incontinent
lay their entrails on the street. Five hundred and seventy pounds! I’ll out and pawn the Duchy!</p>
                  <p>HERALDS. The Lord Chief Justice waits thy princely will,<lb/>
In thy dread father’s Court at Westminster.</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. A Star Chamber matter, Hal — a Star Chamber matter! Glasses, Doll! We’ll drink to his deliverance.</p>
                  <p>HERALDS. You, too, Sir John, as party to those broils<lb/>
And breakings-forth, in like attainder stand<lb/>
For judgment: wherein fail not at your peril!</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. I do remember now to have had some dealings with this same Chief Justice. An old feeble man, drawn abroad in a
cart by horses. We must enlighten — enlighten him, Hal. (<hi rend="italic">Exeunt.</hi>)</p>

                  <p>POINS. Shining over Southwark if he be not puffed out by now. He ran when the watch came. The Chief Justice looks sourly.
Is any appointed to speak for us, Hal?</p>
                  <p>PRINCE. Thy notorious innocence, my known virtue, and if these fail, Sir John’s big belly. I have fed my father’s
exchequer here twice since Easter.</p>
                  <p>CH. JUSTICE. Intemperate, rash, and ill-advisèd men —<lb/>
Yoke-fellows at unsavoury enterprise —<lb/>
Harry, and you, Sir John, stand forth for sentence!</p>
                  <p>FLUELLEN. Put — put there is no indictments discharged upon us yet. To pronounce sentences, look you, pefore the

                  <p>SHALLOW. My dagger? My ink-horn, la! I’ll sit further off. I told you how he’d talk, my lord. But I’ll sit further off.
My dagger, ’faith!</p>
                  <p>CH. JUSTICE. Sir John! Sir John! The licence of inveterate humour overstretched rends like an outworn garment — with like
shame to the enduer. Answer me roundly, what defence make you to the charge you have run through Chepe at ten leagues the
hour?</p>
                  <p>FALSTAFF. Roundly, my lord, my shape — my evident shape.</p>
                  <p>CH. JUSTICE. But ’tis so charged, and will be so witnessed.</p>
                  <p>DOGBERRY. Yes, and by one that hath a stopped watch and everything forsworn about him. Write it down fifteen leagues, my
lord.</p>
                  <p>PRINCE (<hi rend="italic">to</hi> CH. JUSTICE). We knights of the road have ever been fair quarry for your knights of the post to bind
to, but this passes endurance. We left our car, my lord, extinct and combust in the kennel, while we sought an engineer to
hoist her. In which stay she would have continued, but for the prying vulgar who found on her some handle to their
curiosity, which, doubtless, they turned. For in such a car as this ——</p>

to the eye of the initiated as the simplest anagram of “<hi rend="italic">scripsit</hi>” (the “k” being used, of course, for the
desiderated “c,” and the apparently superfluous “n,” for the initial of Nicholas, Bacon’s father). “Frail pretences” (taking
the first three letters of the first, and the last four of the second, word) reveals, beyond negation, the same “Frances”
who wrote to his King (Mar. 25, 1631) that he might be “frail and partake, etc.” The “<hi rend="italic">bald</hi>-pated ostler” who
“<hi rend="italic">con</hi>jures life into, etc.,” is even more palpable and needs not the addi tional “<hi rend="italic">con</hi>tinuance” which
follows. Nor does this exhaust the category. Miss Nessa Droenbergh acutely explains Hamlet’s opening remark to Prince Henry
as a well-bred man’s apology for phenomena due to liquor-excess — briefly a hiccough. But we must remember that Bacon, where
possible, always “doubles his clues,” on the principle of the British railroads’ “distant” and “home” signals. Thus after
“Your pardon too,” comes “’Tis the Rhenish,” a German wine long traded into Britain and the Baltic, and later known as
“hoc(k).” So we have, all but <hi rend="italic">en clair</hi>, the author of “Shakespeare’s” plays proclaiming, “<hi rend="italic">Hoc scripsit Frances
