            <note>
               <p>This text is created direct from the earliest printed
	     text — the small, cheap books in quarto format sold by
	     the booksellers of St Paul's Churchyard for around
	     sixpence. It has not been edited, and so you can
	     experience the idiosyncrasies of early modern print. In
	     an age when spelling was not standardised, a range of
	     ways of spelling even quite simple words was usual. Often
	     homophones — words such as <q>to</q> and
	     <q>too</q> which sound the same but are distinguished in
	     modern spelling — are not clear, and this is one
	     of the great sources of puns for early modern
	     writers. Speech prefixes and stage directions are also
	     not presented in the form readers of modern playtexts are
	     used to, and nor did these early texts include a list of
	     characters or an index of acts and scenes. Some features
	     of early modern printing may also be unfamiliar —
	     the interchangeability of the letters <q>u</q> and
	     <q>v</q>, for example, or <q>i</q> and <q>y</q>. There
	     was no letter <q>j</q> in the sets of type used by
	     printers, so that letter is signalled with the letter
	     <q>i</q> or <q>I</q>. </p>
               <p>To find out more about
	     early modern print and how and why plays were printed see
	     the Furness Collection, University of Pennsylvania's
	     multimedia online tutorials at <ptr target="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/sceti/furness/eric/teach/index.cfm"/>

               <l>I was a Courtier in the Spanish Court.</l>
               <l>My name was <hi>Don Andrea</hi>, my discent</l>
               <l>Though not ignoble, yet inferiour far</l>
               <l>To gratious fortunes of my tender youth;</l>
               <l>For there in prime and pride of all my yeeres,</l>
               <l>By duteous service and deserving love,</l>
               <l>In secret I possest a worrhy dame,</l>
               <l>Which hight sweet <hi>Bel-imperia</hi> by name.</l>
               <l>But in the harvest of my sommer ioyes,</l>
               <l>Deaths winter nipt the blossomes of my blisse,</l>
               <l>Forcing divorce betwixt my love and me.</l>
               <l>For in the late conflict with Portingale,</l>
               <l>My valour drew me into dangers mouth,</l>
               <l>Till life to death made passage through my wounds.</l>
               <l>When I was slaine, my soule descended straight,</l>
               <l>To passe the flowing streame of Acheron:</l>
               <l>But churlish <hi>Charon</hi> only boatman there,</l>
               <l>Said that my rites of buriall not performde,</l>

               <l>And slakte his smoaking Charriot in her floud:</l>
               <l>By <hi>Don Horatio</hi> our knight Marshals sonne,</l>

               <l>Then was the Feriman of hell content,</l>

               <l>There pleasing <hi>Cerberus</hi> with honied speech,</l>
               <l>I past the perils of the sormost porch,</l>
               <l>Not farre from hence amidst ten thousand soules,</l>
               <l>Sate <hi>Minors, Eacus,</hi> and <hi>Rhadamant,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To whome no sooner gan I make approch.</l>
               <l>To crave a pasport for my wandring Ghost:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Minos</hi> in graven leaves of Lotterie,</l>
               <l>Drew forth the manner of my life and death.</l>
               <l>This knight (quoth he) both liv'd and died in love:</l>
               <l>And for his love tried fortune of the warres,</l>
               <l>And by warres fortune lost both love and life.</l>
               <l>When then said <hi>Eacus,</hi> convay him hence,</l>
               <l>To walke with lovers in our fields of love:</l>
               <l>And spend the course of everlasting time,</l>
               <l>Under greene mirtle trees and Cipresse shades.</l>
               <l>No, no, said <hi>Rhadamant,</hi> it were not well,</l>
               <l>With loving soules to place a Martialist,</l>
               <l>He died in warre, and must to martiall fields:</l>
               <l>Where wounded <hi>Hector</hi> lives in lasting paine,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Achilles</hi> mermedons do scoure the plaine.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Minos</hi> mildest censor of the three,</l>
               <l>Made this device to end the difference.</l>
               <l>Send him (quoth he) to our infernall King.</l>
               <l>To dome him as best seemes his Maiestie:</l>
               <l>To this effect my pasport straight was drawne.</l>
               <l>In keeping on my was to <hi>Plutos</hi> Court,</l>
               <l>Through dreadfull shades of ever glooming night:</l>
               <l>I saw more sights then thousand tongues can tell,</l>
               <l>Or pennes write, or mortall harts can think.</l>
               <l>Three waies there were, that on the right hand side,</l>
               <l>Was ready way unto the foresaid fields,</l>
               <l>Where lovers live, and bloudie Martialists,</l>
               <l>But either sort containd within his bounds.</l>

               <l>Was ready downfall to the deepest hell.</l>
               <l>Where poore <hi>Ixion</hi> turnes an endles wheele.</l>
               <l>Where Usurers are choakt with melting golde,</l>
               <l>And wantons are imbraste with ougly snakes:</l>
               <l>And murderers grone with never killing wounds,</l>

               <l>And all soule sinnes with torments overwhelmd,</l>
               <l>Twixt these two waies, I trod the middle path,</l>
