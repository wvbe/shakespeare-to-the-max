Sir, to gratulate your safe return from Ireland, I had nothing 
so readie, nor thought any thing so meete, as these sweete conceited 
Sonets, the deede of that wel deseruing gentleman, maister Edmond 
Spenser: whose name sufficiently warranting the worthinesse of the 
work:  I do more confidently presume to publish it in his 
absence, vnder your name to whom (in my poore opinion) the patronage 
therof, doth in some respectes properly appertaine.  For, besides 
your iudgement and delighte in learned poesie: This gentle Muse 
for her former perfection long wished for in Englande, nowe at the 
length crossing the Seas in your happy companye, (though to your 
selfe vnknowne) seemeth to make choyse of you, as meetest to 
giue her deserued countenaunce, after her retourne: entertaine her, 
then, (Right worshipfull) in sorte best beseeming your gentle minde, 
and her merite, and take in worth my good will herein, who seeke no 
more, but to shew my selfe yours in all dutifull affection.<lb/>

               <l>Whereof when he was wakened with the noyse,</l>

               <l>Think now (quod she) my sonne how great the smart</l>

               <l>and wrapt him in her smock:</l>
               <l>She wrapt him softly, all the while repenting,</l>
               <l>that he the fly did mock.</l>
               <l>She drest his wound and it embaulmed wel</l>
               <l>with salue of soueraigne might:</l>

               <l>Who would not oft be stung as this,</l>
