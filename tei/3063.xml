            <p>My dear Brother
</p>
            <p>I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of profiting by your kind 
invitation, when we last parted, of spending some weeks with you at Churchill, 
&amp; therefore, if quite convenient to you &amp; Mrs. Vernon to receive me 
at present, I shall hope within a few days to be introduced to a Sister whom I 
have so long desired to be acquainted with.  My kind friends here are most 
affectionately urgent with me to prolong my stay, but their hospitable &amp; 
chearful dispositions lead them too much into society for my present situation 
&amp; state of mind; &amp; I impatiently look forward to the hour when I shall 
be admitted into your delightful retirement.  I long to be made known to your 
dear little children, in whose hearts I shall be very eager to secure an 
interest.  I shall soon have need for all my fortitude, as I am on the point of 
separation from my own daughter.  The long illness of her dear Father prevented 
my paying her that attention which Duty &amp; affection equally dictated, &amp; 
I have too much reason to fear that the Governess to whose care I consigned her 
was unequal to the charge.  I have therefore resolved on placing her at one of 
the best Private Schools in Town, where I shall have an opportunity of leaving 
her myself, in my way to you.  I am determined, you see, not to be denied 
admittance at Churchill.  It would indeed give me most painful sensations to 
know that it were not in your power to receive me.

            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson.</hi>
               </l>
               <l/>
               <l>                                            Langford. </l>
            </q>
            <p>You were mistaken, my dear Alicia, in supposing me fixed at this place for 
the rest of the winter.  It grieves me to say how greatly you were mistaken, 
for I have seldom spent three months more agreeably than those which have just 
flown away.  At present, nothing goes smoothly; the Females of the Family are 
united against me.  You foretold how it would be when I first came to Langford, 
&amp; Manwaring is so uncommonly pleasing that I was not without apprehensions 
for myself.  I remember saying to myself, as I drove to the House, "I like this 
Man; pray Heaven no harm come of it!"  But I was determined to be discreet, to 
bear in mind my being only four months a widow, &amp; to be as quiet as 
possible: &amp; I have been so, My dear Creature; I have admitted no one's 
attentions but Manwaring's. I have avoided all general flirtation whatever; I 
have distinguished no Creature besides, of all the Numbers resorting hither, 
except Sir James Martin, on whom I bestowed a little notice, in order to detach 
him from Miss Manwaring; but if the World could know my motive <hi>there</hi>, 
they would honour me.  I have been called an unkind Mother, but it was the 
sacred impulse of maternal affection, it was the advantage of my Daughter that 
led me on; &amp; if that Daughter were not the greatest simpleton on Earth, I 
might have been rewarded for my Exertions as I ought.
</p>
            <p>Sir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but Frederica, who was 
born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so violently against 
the match that I thought it better to lay aside the scheme for the present.  I 
have more than once repented that I did not marry him myself; &amp; were he but 
one degree less contemptibly weak, I certainly should, but I must own myself 
rather romantic in that respect, &amp; that Riches only will not satisfy me. 
The event of all this is very provoking: Sir James is gone, Maria highly 
incensed, &amp; Mrs. Manwaring insupportably jealous; so jealous, in short, 
&amp; so enraged against me, that, in the fury of her temper, I should not be 
surprised at her appealing to her Guardian, if she had the liberty of 
addressing him — but there your Husband stands my friend; &amp; the kindest, 
most amiable action of his Life was his throwing her off forever on her 
Marriage.  Keep up his resentment, therefore, I charge you.  We are now in a 
sad state; no house was ever more altered: the whole family are at war, &amp; 
Manwaring scarcely dares speak to me.  It is time for me to be gone; I have 
therefore determined on leaving them, &amp; shall spend, I hope, a comfortable 
day with you in Town within this week.  If I am as little in favour with 
Mr. Johnson as ever, you must come to me at No. 10 Wigmore Street; but I 
hope this may not be the case, for as Mr. Johnson, with all his faults, is 
a Man to whom that great word "Respectable" is always given, &amp; I am known 
to be so intimate with his wife, his slighting me has an awkward Look.
</p>
            <p>I take Town in my way to that insupportable spot, a Country Village; for I 
am really going to Churchill.  Forgive me, my dear friend, it is my last 
resource.  Were there another place in England open to me, I would prefer it. 
Charles Vernon is my aversion, &amp; I am afraid of his wife.  At Churchill, 
however, I must remain till I have something better in view.  My young Lady 
accompanies me to Town, where I shall deposit her under the care of Miss 
Summers, in Wigmore Street, till she becomes a little more reasonable.  She 
will make good connections there, as the Girls are all of the best Families. 
The price is immense, &amp; much beyond what I can ever attempt to pay.
</p>
            <p>Adieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in Town. — Yours 
Ever,
</p>

            <p>My dear Mother
</p>
            <p>I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in our power to keep our 
promise of spending our Christmas with you; &amp; we are prevented that 
happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to make us any amends.  Lady 
Susan, in a letter to her Brother, has declared her intention of visiting us 
almost immediately — &amp; as such a visit is in all probability merely an 
affair of convenience, it is impossible to conjecture its length.  I was by no 
means prepared for such an event, nor can I now account for her Ladyship's 
conduct; Langford appeared so exactly the place for her in every respect, as 
well from the elegant &amp; expensive stile of living there, as from her 
particular attachment to Mrs. Manwaring, that I was very far from expecting 
so speedy a distinction, tho' I always imagined from her increasing friendship 
for us since her Husband's death, that we should at some future period be 
obliged to receive her.  Mr. Vernon, I think, was a great deal too kind to 
her when he was in Staffordshire; her behaviour to him, independent of her 
general Character, has been so inexcusably artful and ungenerous since our 
Marriage was first in agitation that no one less amiable &amp; mild than 
himself could have overlooked it all; &amp; tho', as his Brother's widow, &amp; 
in narrow circumstances, it was proper to render her pecuniary assistance, I 
cannot help thinking his pressing invitation to her to visit us at Churchill 
perfectly unnecessary.  Disposed, however, as he always is to think the best of 
every one, her display of Greif, &amp; professions of regret, &amp; general 
resolutions of prudence were sufficient to soften his heart, &amp; make him 
really confide in her sincerity.  But as for myself, I am still unconvinced; 
&amp; plausibly as her Ladyship has now written, I cannot make up my mind till 
I better understand her real meaning in coming to us.  You may guess, 
therefore, my dear Madam, with what feelings I look forward to her arrival. 
She will have occasion for all those attractive Powers for which she is 
celebrated, to gain any share of my regard; &amp; I shall certainly endeavour 
to guard myself against their influence, if not accompanied by something more 
substantial.  She expresses a most eager desire of being acquainted with me, 
&amp; makes very gracious mention of my children, but I am not quite weak 
enough to suppose a woman who has behaved with inattention if not unkindness to 
her own child, should be attached to any of mine.  Miss Vernon is to be placed 
at a school in Town before her Mother comes to us, which I am glad of, for her 
sake &amp; my own.  It must be to her advantage to be separated from her 
Mother, &amp; a girl of sixteen who has received so wretched an education could 
not be a very desirable companion here.  Reginald has long wished, I know, to 
see the captivating Lady Susan, &amp; we shall depend on his joining our party 
soon.  I am glad to hear that my Father continues so well; &amp; am, with best 
Love, &amp;c.,

            </q>
            <p>My dear Sister
</p>
            <p>I congratulate you &amp; Mr. Vernon on being about to receive into your 
family the most accomplished Coquette in England.  As a very distinguished 
Flirt, I have always been taught to consider her; but it has lately fallen in 
my way to hear some particulars of her conduct at Langford, which proves that 
she does not confine herself to that sort of honest flirtation which satisfies 
most people, but aspires to the more delicious gratification of making a whole 
family miserable.  By her behaviour to Mr. Manwaring she gave jealousy 
&amp; wretchedness to his wife, &amp; by her attentions to a young man 
previously attached to Mr. Manwaring's sister deprived an amiable girl of 
her Lover.  I learnt all this from a Mr. Smith, now in this neighbourhood 
(I have dined with him, at Hurst &amp; Wilford), who is just come from 
Langford, where he was a fortnight in the house with her Ladyship, &amp; who is 
therefore well qualified to make the communication.
</p>
            <p>What a Woman she must be!  I long to see her, &amp; shall certainly accept 
your kind invitation, that I may form some idea of those bewitching powers 
which can do so much — engaging at the same time, &amp; in the same house, the 
affections of two Men, who were neither of them at liberty to bestow them — 
and all this without the charm of Youth!  I am glad to find Miss Vernon does 
not accompany her Mother to Churchill, as she has not even Manners to recommend 
her, &amp; according to Mr. Smith's account, is equally dull &amp; proud. 
Where Pride &amp; Stupidity unite there can be no dissimulation worthy notice, 
&amp; Miss Vernon shall be consigned to unrelenting contempt; but by all that I 
can gather, Lady Susan possesses a degree of captivating Deceit which it must 
be pleasing to witness &amp; detect.  I shall be with you very soon, &amp; 
am
</p>
            <p>                    your affec. Brother R. DE COURCY</p>

            <head>LETTER 5.</head>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson.</hi>
               </l>
               <l/>
               <l>                                          Churchill. </l>
            </q>
            <p>I received your note, my dear Alicia, just before I left Town, &amp; rejoice 
to be assured that Mr. Johnson suspected nothing of your engagement the 
evening before.  It is undoubtedly better to deceive him entirely; since he 
will be stubborn, he must be tricked.  I arrived here in safety, &amp; have no 
reason to complain of my reception from Mr. Vernon; but I confess myself 
not equally satisfied with the behaviour of his Lady.  She is perfectly 
well-bred, indeed, &amp; has the air of a woman of fashion, but her Manners are 
not such as can persuade me of her being prepossessed in my favour.  I wanted 
her to be delighted at seeing me — I was as amiable as possible on the 
occasion — but all in vain.  She does not like me.  To be sure, when we 
consider that I <hi>did</hi> take some pains to prevent my Brother-in-law's 
marrying her, this want of cordiality is not very surprising; &amp; yet it 
shews an illiberal &amp; vindictive spirit 
to resent a project which influenced me six years ago, &amp; which never 
succeeded at last.
</p>
            <p>I am sometimes half disposed to repent that I did not let Charles buy Vernon 
Castle, when we were obliged to sell it; but it was a trying circumstance, 
especially as the sale took place exactly at the time of his marriage; &amp; 
everybody ought to respect the delicacy of those feelings which could not 
endure that my Husband's Dignity should be lessened by his younger brother's 
having possession of the Family Estate.  Could Matters have been so arranged as 
to prevent the necessity of our leaving the Castle, could we have lived with 
Charles &amp; kept him single, I should have been very far from persuading my 
husband to dispose of it elsewhere; but Charles was then on the point of 
marrying Miss De Courcy, &amp; the event has justified me.  Here are Children 
in abundance, &amp; what benefit could have accrued to me from his purchasing 
Vernon?  My having prevented it may perhaps have given his wife an unfavourable 
impression — but where there is a disposition to dislike, a motive will never 
be wanting; &amp; as to money-matters it has not withheld him from being very 
useful to me.  I really have a regard for him, he is so easily imposed on!
</p>
            <p>The house is a good one, the Furniture fashionable, &amp; everything 
announces plenty &amp; elegance.  Charles is very rich, I am sure; when a Man 
has once got his name in a Banking House, he rolls in money.  But they do not 
know what to do with it, keep very little company, &amp; never go to Town but 
on business.  We shall be as stupid as possible.  I mean to win my 
Sister-in-law's heart through the children; I know all their names already, 
&amp; am going to attach myself with the greatest 
sensibility to one in particular, a young 
Frederic, whom I take on my lap &amp; sigh over for his dear Uncle's sake.
</p>
            <p>Poor Manwaring! — I need not tell you how much I miss him — how 
perpetually he is in my Thoughts.  I found a dismal letter from him on my 
arrival here, full of complaints of his wife &amp; sister, &amp; lamentations 
on the cruelty of his fate.  I passed off the letter as his wife's, to the 
Vernons, &amp; when I write to him, it must be under cover to you.
</p>
            <p>                             Yours Ever, S. V.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Well, my dear Reginald, I have seen this dangerous creature, &amp; must give 
you some description of her, tho' I hope you will soon be able to form your own 
judgement.  She is really excessively pretty.  However you may choose to 
question the allurements of a Lady no longer young, I must, for my own part, 
declare that I have seldom seen so lovely a Woman as Lady Susan.  She is 
delicately fair, with fine grey eyes &amp; dark eyelashes; &amp; from her 
appearance one would not suppose her more than five &amp; twenty, tho' she must 
in fact be ten years older.  I was certainly not disposed to admire her, tho' 
always hearing she was beautiful; but I cannot help feeling that she possesses 
an uncommon union of Symmetry, Brilliancy, &amp; Grace.  Her address to me was 
so gentle, frank, &amp; even affectionate, that, if I had not known how much 
she has always disliked me for marrying Mr. Vernon, &amp; that we had never 
met before, I should have imagined her an attached friend.  One is apt, I 
beleive, to connect assurance of manner with coquetry, &amp; to expect that an 
impudent address will naturally attend an impudent mind; at least I was myself 
prepared for an improper degree of confidence in Lady Susan; but her 
Countenance is absolutely sweet, &amp; her voice &amp; manner winningly mild. 
I am sorry it is so, for what is this but Deceit?  Unfortunately, one knows her 
too well.  She is clever &amp; agreable, has all that knowledge of the world 
which makes conversation easy, &amp; talks very well with a happy command of 
Language, which is too often used, I beleive, to make Black appear White.  She 
has already almost persuaded me of her being warmly attached to her daughter, 
tho' I have been so long convinced to the contrary.  She speaks of her with so 
much tenderness &amp; anxiety, lamenting so bitterly the neglect of her 
education, which she represents however as wholly unavoidable, that I am forced 
to recollect how many successive Springs her Ladyship spent in Town, while her 
Daughter was left in Staffordshire to the care of servants, or a Governess very 
little better, to prevent my believing what she says.
</p>
            <p>If her manners have so great an influence on my resentful heart, you may 
judge how much more strongly they operate on Mr. Vernon's generous temper. 
I wish I could be as well satisfied as he is, that it was really her choice to 
leave Langford for Churchill; &amp; if she had not stayed three months there 
before she discovered that her friends' manner of Living did not suit her 
situation or feelings, I might have beleived that concern for the loss of such 
a Husband as Mr. Vernon, to whom her own behaviour was far from 
unexceptionable, might for a time make her wish for retirement.  But I cannot 
forget the length of her visit to the Manwarings; &amp; when I reflect on the 
different mode of Life which she led with them, from that to which she must now 
submit, I can only suppose that the wish of establishing her reputation by 
following, tho' late, the path of propriety, occasioned her removal from a 
family where she must in reality have been particularly happy.  Your friend 
Mr. Smith's story, however, cannot be quite correct, as she corresponds 
regularly with Mrs. Manwaring.  At any rate it must be exaggerated; it is 
scarcely possible that two men should be so grossly deceived by her at 
once.

            <p>My dear Alicia
</p>
            <p>You are very good in taking notice of Frederica, &amp; I am grateful for it 
as a mark of your friendship; but as I cannot have any doubt of the warmth of 
that friendship, I am far from exacting so heavy a sacrifice.  She is a stupid 
girl, &amp; has nothing to recommend her.  I would not, therefore, on any 
account have you encumber one moment of your precious time by sending for her 
to Edward Street, especially as every visit is so many hours deducted from the 
grand affair of Education, which I really wish to be attended to while she 
remains with Miss Summers.  I want her to play &amp; sing with some portion of 
Taste &amp; a good deal of assurance, as she has <hi>my</hi> hand &amp; arm, 
&amp; a tolerable voice.  <hi>I</hi> was so much indulged in my infant years 
that I was never obliged to attend to anything, &amp; consequently am without 
the accomplishments which are now necessary to finish a pretty Woman.  Not that 
I am an advocate for the prevailing fashion of acquiring a perfect knowledge of 
all Languages, Arts, &amp; Sciences.  It is throwing time away; to be Mistress 
of French, Italian, &amp; German, Music, Singing, Drawing, &amp;c. will gain a 
Woman some applause, but will not add one Lover to her list.  Grace &amp; 
Manner, after all, are of the greatest importance.  I do not mean, therefore, 
that Frederica's acquirements should be more than superficial, &amp; I flatter 
myself that she will not remain long enough at School to understand anything 
thoroughly.  I hope to see her the wife of Sir James within a twelvemonth.  You 
know on what I ground my hope, &amp; it is certainly a good foundation, for 
school must be very humiliating to a girl of Frederica's age.  And by the by, 
you had better not invite her any more on that account, as I wish her to find 
her situation as unpleasant as possible.  I am sure of Sir James at any time, 
&amp; could make him renew his application by a Line.  I shall trouble you 
meanwhile to prevent his forming any other attachment when he comes to Town. 
Ask him to your house occasionally, &amp; talk to him of Frederica, that he may 
not forget her.
</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I commend my own conduct in this affair extremely, &amp; 
regard it as a very happy instance of circumspection &amp; tenderness.  Some 
Mothers would have insisted on their daughter's accepting so good an offer on 
the first overture, but I could not answer it to myself to force Frederica into 
a marriage from which her heart revolted; &amp; instead of adopting so harsh a 
measure, merely propose to make it her own choice, by rendering her thoroughly 
uncomfortable till she does accept him. — But enough of this tiresome 
girl.
</p>
            <p>You may well wonder how I contrive to pass my time here, &amp; for the first 
week it was most insufferably dull.  Now, however, we begin to mend; our party 
is enlarged by Mrs. Vernon's Brother, a handsome young Man, who promises me 
some amusement.  There is something about him which rather interests me, a sort 
of sauciness &amp; familiarity which I shall teach him to correct.  He is 
lively &amp; seems clever;, &amp; when I have inspired him with greater respect 
for me than his sister's kind offices have implanted, he may be an agreable 
Flirt.  There is exquisite pleasure in subduing an insolent spirit, in making a 
person predetermined to dislike, acknowledge one's superiority.  I have 
disconcerted him already by my calm reserve, &amp; it shall be my endeavour to 
humble the pride of these self-important De Courcys still lower, to convince 
Mrs. Vernon that her sisterly cautions have been bestowed in vain, &amp; to 
persuade Reginald that she has scandalously belied me.  This project will serve 
at least to amuse me, &amp; prevent my feeling so acutely this dreadful 
separation from You &amp; all whom I love.  Adieu.

               <l>
                  <hi>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>My dear Mother
</p>
            <p>You must not expect Reginald back again for some time.  He desires me to 
tell you that the present open weather induced him to accept Mr. Vernon's 
invitation to prolong his stay in Sussex, that they may have some hunting 
together.  He means to send for his Horses immediately, &amp; it is impossible 
to say when you may see him in Kent.  I will not disguise my sentiments on this 
change from you, my dear Madam, tho' I think you had better not communicate 
them to my father, whose excessive anxiety about Reginald would subject him to 
an alarm which might seriously affect his health &amp; spirits.  Lady Susan has 
certainly contrived, in the space of a fortnight, to make my Brother like her. 
In short, I am persuaded that his continuing here beyond the time originally 
fixed for his return is occasioned as much by a degree of fascination towards 
her, as by the wish of hunting with Mr. Vernon, &amp; of course I cannot 
receive that pleasure from the length of his visit which my Brother's company 
would otherwise give me.  I am, indeed, provoked at the artifice of this 
unprincipled Woman.  What stronger proof of her dangerous abilities can be 
given than this perversion of Reginald's judgement, which when he entered the 
house was so decidedly against her?  In his last letter he actually gave me 
some particulars of her behaviour at Langford, such as he received from a 
Gentleman who knew her perfectly well, which, if true, must raise abhorrence 
against her, &amp; which Reginald himself was entirely disposed to credit.  His 
opinion of her, I am sure, was as low as of any Woman in England; &amp; when he 
first came it was evident that he considered her as one entitled neither to 
Delicacy nor respect, &amp; that he felt she would be delighted with the 
attentions of any Man inclined to flirt with her.
</p>
            <p>Her behaviour, I confess, has been calculated to do away with such an idea; 
I have not detected the smallest impropriety in it — nothing of vanity, of 
pretension, of Levity; &amp; she is altogether so attractive that I should not 
wonder at his being delighted with her, had he known nothing of her previous to 
this personal acquaintance; but against reason, against conviction, to be so 
well pleased with her, as I am sure he is, does really astonish me.  His 
admiration was at first very strong, but no more than was natural, &amp; I did 
not wonder at his being much struck by the gentleness &amp; delicacy of her 
Manners; but when he has mentioned her of late it has been in terms of more 
extraordinary praise; &amp; yesterday he actually said that he could not be 
surprised at any effect produced on the heart of Man by such Loveliness &amp; 
such Abilities; &amp; when I lamented, in reply, the badness of her 
disposition, he observed that whatever might have been her errors, they were to 
be imputed to her neglected Education &amp; early Marriage, &amp; that she was 
altogether a wonderful Woman.
</p>
            <p>This tendency to excuse her conduct, or to forget it in the warmth of 
admiration, vexes me; &amp; if I did not know that Reginald is too much at home 
at Churchill to need an invitation for lengthening his visit, I should regret 
Mr. Vernon's giving him any.
</p>
            <p>Lady Susan's intentions are of course those of absolute coquetry, or a 
desire of universal admiration.  I cannot for a moment imagine that she has 
anything more serious in view; but it mortifies me to see a young Man of 
Reginald's sense duped by her at all.  I am, &amp;c.

            <p>My dearest Friend
</p>
            <p>I congratulate you on Mr. De Courcy's arrival, &amp; I advise you by all 
means to marry him; his Father's Estate is, we know, considerable, &amp; I 
beleive certainly entailed.  Sir Reginald is very 
infirm, &amp; not likely to stand in your way long.  I hear the young Man well 
spoken of; &amp; tho' no one can really deserve you, my dearest Susan, 
Mr. De Courcy may be worth having.  Manwaring will storm of course, but you 
may easily pacify him; besides, the most scrupulous point of honour could not 
require you to wait for <hi>his</hi> emancipation.  I have seen Sir James; he came 
to Town for a few days last week, &amp; called several times in Edward Street. 
I talked to him about you &amp; your Daughter, &amp; he is so far from having 
forgotten you, that I am sure he would marry either of you with pleasure.  I 
gave him hopes of Frederica's relenting, &amp; told him a great deal of her 
improvements.  I scolded him for making Love to Maria Manwaring; he protested 
that he had been only in joke, &amp; we both laughed heartily at her 
disappointment; and, in short, were very agreable.  He is as silly as ever. —

            </q>
            <p>I am obliged to you, my dear friend, for your advice respecting Mr. De 
Courcy, which I know was given with the full conviction of its expediency, tho' 
I am not quite determined on following it.  I cannot easily resolve on anything 
so serious as Marriage; especially as I am not at present in want of money, 
&amp; might perhaps, till the old Gentleman's death, be very little benefited 
by the match.  It is true that I am vain enough to beleive it within my reach. 
I have made him sensible of my power, &amp; can now enjoy the pleasure of 
triumphing over a Mind prepared to dislike me, &amp; prejudiced against all my 
past actions.  His sister, too, is, I hope, convinced how little the ungenerous 
representations of any one to the disadvantage of another will avail when 
opposed to the immediate influence of Intellect &amp; Manner.  I see plainly 
that she is uneasy at my progress in the good opinion of her Brother, &amp; 
conclude that nothing will be wanting on her part to counteract me; but having 
once made him doubt the justice of her opinion of me, I think I may defy her. 
It has been delightful to me to watch his advances towards intimacy, especially 
to observe his altered manner in consequence of my repressing by the calm 
dignity of my deportment his insolent approach to direct familiarity.  My 
conduct has been equally guarded from the first, &amp; I never behaved less 
like a Coquette in the whole course of my Life, tho' perhaps my desire of 
dominion was never more decided.  I have subdued him entirely by sentiment 
&amp; serious conversation, &amp; made him, I may venture to say, at least 
<hi>half</hi> in Love with me, without the semblance of the most commonplace 
flirtation.  Mrs. Vernon's consciousness of deserving every sort of revenge 
that it can be in my power to inflict for her ill-offices could alone enable 
her to perceive that I am actuated by any design in behaviour so gentle &amp; 
unpretending.  Let her think &amp; act as she chuses, however.  I have never 
yet found that the advice of a Sister could prevent a young Man's being in love 
if he chose it.  We are advancing now towards some kind of confidence, &amp; in 
short are likely to be engaged in a sort of platonic friendship.  On 
<hi>my</hi> side you may be sure of its never being more, for if I were not 
already as much attached to another person as I can be to any one, I should 
make a point of not bestowing my affection on a Man who had dared to think so 
meanly of me.
</p>
            <p>Reginald has a good figure, &amp; is not unworthy the praise you have heard 
given him, but is still greatly inferior to our friend at Langford.  He is less 
polished, less insinuating than Manwaring, &amp; is comparatively deficient in 
the power of saying those delightful things which put one in good humour with 
oneself &amp; all the world.  He is quite agreable enough, however, to afford 
me amusement, &amp; to make many of those hours pass very pleasantly which 
would otherwise be spent in endeavouring to overcome my sister-in-law's 
reserve, &amp; listening to her Husband's insipid talk.
</p>
            <p>Your account of Sir James is most satisfactory, &amp; I mean to give Miss 
Frederica a hint of my intentions very soon. — Yours, &amp;c.,

            <p>I really grow quite uneasy, my dearest Mother, about Reginald, from 
witnessing the very rapid increase of Lady Susan's influence.  They are now on 
terms of the most particular friendship, frequently engaged in long 
conversations together; &amp; she has contrived by the most artful coquetry to 
subdue his Judgement to her own purposes.  It is impossible to see the intimacy 
between them so very soon established without some alarm, tho' I can hardly 
suppose that Lady Susan's views extend to marriage.  I wish you could get 
Reginald home again under any plausible pretence; he is not at all disposed to 
leave us, &amp; I have given him as many hints of my Father's precarious state 
of health as common decency will allow me to do in my own house.  Her power 
over him must now be boundless, as she has entirely effaced all his former 
ill-opinion, &amp; persuaded him not merely to forget but to justify her 
conduct.  Mr. Smith's account of her proceedings at Langford, where he 
accused her of having made Mr. Manwaring &amp; a young Man engaged to Miss 
Manwaring distractedly in love with her, which Reginald firmly beleived when he 
came to Churchill, is now, he is persuaded, only a scandalous invention.  He 
has told me so in a warmth of manner which spoke his regret at having ever 
beleived the contrary himself.
</p>
            <p>How sincerely do I grieve that she ever entered this house!  I always looked 
forward to her coming with uneasiness; but very far was it from originating in 
anxiety for Reginald.  I expected a most disagreable companion for myself, but 
could not imagine that my Brother would be in the smallest danger of being 
captivated by a Woman with whose principles he was so well acquainted, &amp; 
whose character he so heartily despised.  If you can get him away, it will be a 
good thing.

            </q>
            <p>I know that young Men in general do not admit of any inquiry even from their 
nearest relations into affairs of the heart, but I hope, my dear Reginald, that 
you will be superior to such as allow nothing for a Father's anxiety, &amp; 
think themselves privileged to refuse him their confidence &amp; slight his 
advice.  You must be sensible that as an only son, &amp; the representative of 
an ancient Family, your conduct in Life is most interesting to your 
connections.  In the very important concern of Marriage especially, there is 
everything at stake — your own happiness, that of your Parents, &amp; the 
credit of your name.  I do not suppose that you would deliberately form an 
absolute engagement of that nature without acquainting your Mother &amp; 
myself, or at least without being convinced that we should approve of your 
choice; but I cannot help fearing that you may be drawn in, by the Lady who has 
lately attached you, to a Marriage which the whole of your Family, far &amp; 
near, must highly reprobate.
</p>
            <p>Lady Susan's age is itself a material objection, but her want of character 
is one so much more serious that the difference of even twelve years becomes in 
comparison of small amount.  Were you not blinded by a sort of fascination, it 
would be ridiculous in me to repeat the instances of great misconduct on her 
side, so very generally known.  Her neglect of her husband, her encouragement 
of other Men, her extravagance &amp; dissipation, were so gross &amp; notorious 
that no one could be ignorant of them at the time, nor can now have forgotten 
them.  To our Family she has always been represented in softened colours by the 
benevolence of Mr. Charles Vernon; &amp; yet, in spite of his generous 
endeavours to excuse her, we know that she did, from the most selfish motives, 
take all possible pains to prevent his marrying Catherine.
</p>
            <p>My Years &amp; increasing Infirmities make me very desirous, my dear 
Reginald, of seeing you settled in the world.  To the Fortune of your wife, the 
goodness of my own will make me indifferent; but her family &amp; character 
must be equally unexceptionable.  When your choice is so fixed as that no 
objection can be made to either, I can promise you a ready &amp; chearful 
consent; but it is my Duty to oppose a Match which deep 
Art only could render probable, &amp; must in the 
end make wretched.
</p>
            <p>It is possible her behaviour may arise only from Vanity, or the wish of 
gaining the admiration of a Man whom she must imagine to be particularly 
prejudiced against her; but it is more likely that she should aim at something 
farther.  She is poor, &amp; may naturally seek an alliance which may be 
advantageous to herself.  You know your own rights, 
&amp; that it is out of my power to prevent your 
inheriting the family Estate. My Ability of distressing you during my Life 
would be a species of revenge to which I should hardly stoop under any 
circumstances.  I honestly tell you my Sentiments &amp; Intentions: I do not 
wish to work on your Fears, but on your Sense &amp; Affection.  It would 
destroy every comfort of my Life to know that you were married to Lady Susan 
Vernon: it would be the death of that honest Pride with which I have hitherto 
considered my son; I should blush to see him, to hear of him, to think of 
him.
</p>
            <p>I may perhaps do no good but that of relieving my own mind by this Letter, 
but I felt it my Duty to tell you that your partiality for Lady Susan is no 
secret to your friends, &amp; to warn you against her.  I should be glad to 
hear your reasons for disbelieving Mr. Smith's intelligence; you had no 
doubt of its authenticity a month ago.
</p>
            <p>If you can give me your assurance of having no design beyond enjoying the 
conversation of a clever woman for a short period, &amp; of yielding 
admiration only to her Beauty &amp; Abilities, without being blinded by them 
to her faults, you will restore me to happiness; but if you cannot do this, 
explain to me, at least, what has occasioned so great an alteration in your 
opinion of her.

            <p>My dear Catherine
</p>
            <p>Unluckily I was confined to my room when your last letter came, by a cold 
which affected my eyes so much as to prevent my reading it myself; so I could 
not refuse your Father when he offered to read it to me, by which means he 
became acquainted, to my great vexation, with all your fears about your 
Brother.  I had intended to write to Reginald myself as soon as my eyes would 
let me, to point out as well as I could the danger of an intimate acquaintance 
with so artful a woman as Lady Susan, to a young Man of his age &amp; high 
expectations.  I meant, moreover, to have reminded him of our being quite alone 
now, &amp; very much in need of him to keep up our spirits these long winter 
evenings.  Whether it would have done any good can never be settled now, but I 
am excessively vexed that Sir Reginald should know anything of a matter which 
we foresaw would make him so uneasy.  He caught all your fears the moment he 
had read your Letter, and I am sure has not had the business out of his head 
since.  He wrote by the same post to Reginald a long letter full of it all, 
&amp; particularly asking an explanation of what he may have heard from Lady 
Susan to contradict the late shocking reports.  His answer came this morning, 
which I shall enclose to you, as I think you will like to see it.  I wish it 
was more satisfactory; but it seems written with such a determination to think 
well of Lady Susan, that his assurances as to Marriage, &amp;c., do not set my 
heart at ease.  I say all I can, however, to satisfy your Father, &amp; he is 
certainly less uneasy since Reginald's letter.  How provoking it is, my dear 
Catherine, that this unwelcome Guest of yours should not only prevent our 
meeting this Christmas, but be the occasion of so much vexation &amp; trouble! 
Kiss the dear Children for me.  Your affec: Mother,

</p>
            <p>I have this moment received your Letter, which has given me more 
astonishment than I ever felt before.  I am to thank my Sister, I suppose, for 
having represented me in such a light as to injure me in your opinion, &amp; 
give you all this alarm.  I know not why she should chuse to make herself 
&amp; her family uneasy by apprehending an Event which no one but herself, I 
can affirm, would ever have thought possible.  To impute such a design to Lady 
Susan would be taking from her every claim to that excellent understanding 
which her bitterest Enemies have never denied her; &amp; equally low must sink 
my pretensions to common sense if I am suspected of matrimonial views in my 
behaviour to her.  Our difference of age must be an insuperable objection, 
&amp; I entreat you, my dear Sir, to quiet your mind, &amp; no longer harbour a 
suspicion which cannot be more injurious to your own peace than to our 
Understandings.
</p>
            <p>I can have no other view in remaining with Lady Susan, than to enjoy for a 
short time (as you have yourself expressed it) the conversation of a Woman of 
high mental powers.  If Mrs. Vernon would allow something to my affection 
for herself &amp; her husband in the length of my visit, she would do more 
justice to us all; but my Sister is unhappily prejudiced beyond the hope of 
conviction against Lady Susan.  From an attachment to her husband, which in 
itself does honour to both, she cannot forgive the endeavours at preventing 
their union which have been attributed to selfishness in Lady Susan; but in 
this case, as well as in many others, the World has most grossly injured that 
Lady, by supposing the worst where the motives of her conduct have been 
doubtful.
</p>
            <p>Lady Susan had heard something so materially to the disadvantage of my 
Sister, as to persuade her that the happiness of Mr. Vernon, to whom she 
was always much attached, would be absolutely destroyed by the Marriage.  And 
this circumstance, while it explains the true motive of Lady Susan's conduct, 
&amp; removes all the blame which has been so lavished on her, may also 
convince us how little the general report of any one ought to be credited; 
since no character, however upright, can escape the malevolence of slander.  If 
my Sister, in the security of retirement, with as little opportunity as 
inclination to do Evil, could not avoid Censure, we must not rashly condemn 
those who, living in the World &amp; surrounded with temptation, should be 
accused of Errors which they are known to have the power of committing.
</p>
            <p>I blame myself severely for having so easily beleived the slanderous tales 
invented by Charles Smith to the prejudice of Lady Susan, as I am now convinced 
how greatly they have traduced her.  As to Mrs. Manwaring's jealousy, it 
was totally his own invention, &amp; his account of her attaching Miss 
Manwaring's Lover was scarcely better founded.  Sir James Martin had been drawn 
in by that young Lady to pay her some attention; &amp; as he is a Man of 
fortune, it was easy to see that <hi>her</hi> views extended to Marriage.  It 
is well known that Miss Manwaring is absolutely on the catch for a husband, 
&amp; no one therefore can pity her for losing, by the superior attractions of 
another woman, the chance of being able to make a worthy Man completely 
miserable.  Lady Susan was far from intending such a conquest, &amp; on finding 
how warmly Miss Manwaring resented her Lover's defection, determined, in spite 
of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Manwaring's most earnest entreaties, to leave the 
family.  I have reason to imagine that she did receive serious Proposals from 
Sir James, but her removing to Langford immediately on the discovery of his 
attachment, must acquit her on that article with any Mind of common candour. 
You will, I am sure, my dear Sir, feel the truth of this, &amp; will hereby 
learn to do justice to the character of a very injured Woman.
</p>
            <p>I know that Lady Susan in coming to Churchill was governed only by the most 
honourable &amp; amiable intentions; her prudence &amp; economy are exemplary, 
her regard for Mr. Vernon equal even to <hi>his</hi> deserts; &amp; her 
wish of obtaining my sister's good opinion merits a better return than it has 
received.  As a Mother she is unexceptionable; her solid affection for her 
Child is shewn by placing her in hands where her Education will be properly 
attended to; but because she has not the blind &amp; weak partiality of most 
Mothers, she is accused of wanting Maternal Tenderness.  Every person of Sense, 
however, will know how to value &amp; commend her well-directed affection, 
&amp; will join me in wishing that Frederica Vernon may prove more worthy than 
she has yet done of her Mother's tender care.
</p>
            <p>I have now, my dear Sir, written my real sentiments of Lady Susan; you will 
know from this Letter how highly I admire her Abilities, &amp; esteem her 
Character; but if you are not equally convinced by my full &amp; solemn 
assurance that your fears have been most idly created, you will deeply mortify 
&amp; distress me. — I am, &amp;c.

            </q>
            <p>My dear Mother
</p>
            <p>I return you Reginald's letter, &amp; rejoice with all my heart that my 
Father is made easy by it.  Tell him so, with my congratulations; but between 
ourselves, I must own it has only convinced <hi>me</hi> of my Brother's having 
no <hi>present</hi> intention of marrying Lady Susan — not that he is in no 
danger of doing so three months hence.  He gives a very plausible account of 
her behaviour at Langford; I wish it may be true, but his intelligence must 
come from herself, &amp; I am less disposed to beleive it than to lament the 
degree of intimacy subsisting between them implied by the discussion of such a 
subject.
</p>
            <p>I am sorry to have incurred his displeasure, but can expect nothing better 
while he is so very eager in Lady Susan's justification.  He is very severe 
against me indeed, &amp; yet I hope I have not been hasty in my judgement of 
her.  Poor Woman! tho' I have reasons enough for my dislike, I cannot help 
pitying her at present, as she is in real distress, &amp; with too much cause. 
She had this morning a letter from the Lady with whom she has placed her 
daughter, to request that Miss Vernon might be immediately removed, as she had 
been detected in an attempt to run away. 
Why, or whither she intended to go, does not appear; but as her situation seems 
to have been unexceptionable, it is a sad thing, &amp; of course highly 
afflicting to Lady Susan.
</p>
            <p>Frederica must be as much as sixteen, &amp; ought to know better; but from 
what her Mother insinuates, I am afraid she is a perverse girl.  She has been 
sadly neglected, however, &amp; her Mother ought to remember it.
</p>
            <p>Mr. Vernon set off for Town as soon as she had determined what should be 
done.  He is, if possible, to prevail on Miss Summers to let Frederica continue 
with her; &amp; if he cannot succeed, to bring her to Churchill for the 
present, till some other situation can be found for her.  Her Ladyship is 
comforting herself meanwhile by strolling along the Shrubbery with Reginald, 
calling forth all his tender feelings, I suppose, on this distressing occasion. 
She has been talking a great deal about it to me.  She talks vastly well; I am 
afraid of being ungenerous, or I should say <hi>too</hi> well to feel so very 
deeply.  But I will not look for Faults; she may be Reginald's Wife — Heaven 
forbid it! — but why should I be quicker-sighted than anybody else? 
Mr. Vernon declares that he never saw deeper distress than hers, on the 
receipt of the Letter — &amp; is his judgement inferior to mine?
</p>
            <p>She was very unwilling that Frederica should be allowed to come to 
Churchill, &amp; justly enough, as it seems a sort of reward to Behaviour 
deserving very differently; but it was impossible to take her anywhere else, 
&amp; she is not to remain here long.
</p>
            <p>"It will be absolutely necessary," said she, "as you, my dear Sister, must 
be sensible, to treat my daughter with some severity while she is here; — a 
most painful necessity, but I will endeavour to submit to it.  I am afraid I 
have often been too indulgent, but my poor Frederica's temper could never bear 
opposition well.  You must support &amp; encourage me — You must urge the 
necessity of reproof if you see me too lenient."
</p>
            <p>All this sounds very reasonably.  Reginald is so incensed against the poor 
silly Girl!  Surely it is not to Lady Susan's credit that he should be so 
bitter against her daughter; his idea of her must be drawn from the Mother's 
description.
</p>
            <p>Well, whatever may be his fate, we have the comfort of knowing that we have 
done our utmost to save him.  We must commit the event to an Higher Power. 
Yours Ever, &amp;c.

            </q>
            <p>Never, my dearest Alicia, was I so provoked in my life as by a Letter this 
morning from Miss Summers.  That horrid girl of mine has been trying to run 
away.  I had not a notion of her being such a little devil before, she seemed 
to have all the Vernon Milkiness; but on receiving the letter in which I 
declared my intention about Sir James, she actually attempted to elope; at 
least, I cannot otherwise account for her doing it.  She meant, I suppose, to 
go to the Clarkes in Staffordshire, for she has no other acquaintance.  But 
she <hi>shall</hi> be punished, she <hi>shall</hi> have him.  I have sent 
Charles to Town to make matters up if he can, for I do not by any means want 
her here.  If Miss Summers will not keep her, you must find me out another 
school, unless we can get her married immediately.  Miss S. writes word that 
she could not get the young Lady to assign any cause for her extraordinary 
conduct, which confirms me in my own private explanation of it.
</p>
            <p>Frederica is too shy, I think, &amp; too much in awe of me to tell tales; 
but if the mildness of her Uncle <hi>should</hi> get anything from her, I am 
not afraid.  I trust I shall be able to make my story as good as hers.  If I am 
vain of anything, it is of my eloquence.  Consideration &amp; Esteem as surely 
follow command of Language, as Admiration waits on Beauty.   And  here I have 
opportunity enough for the exercise of my Talent, as the cheif of my time is 
spent in Conversation.  Reginald is never easy unless we are by ourselves, 
&amp; when the weather is tolerable, we pace the shrubbery for hours together. 
I like him on the whole very well; he is clever &amp; has a good deal to say, 
but he is sometimes impertinent &amp; troublesome.  There is a sort of 
ridiculous delicacy about him which requires the fullest explanation of 
whatever he may have heard to my disadvantage, &amp; is never satisfied till he 
thinks he has ascertained the beginning &amp; end of everything.
</p>
            <p>This is <hi>one</hi> sort of Love, but I confess it does not particularly 
recommend itself to me.  I infinitely prefer the tender &amp; liberal spirit of 
Manwaring, which, impressed with the deepest conviction of my merit, is 
satisfied that whatever I do must be right; &amp; look with a degree of 
contempt on the inquisitive &amp; doubtful Fancies of that Heart which seems 
always debating on the reasonableness of its Emotions.  Manwaring is indeed, 
beyond compare, superior to Reginald — superior in everything but the 
power of being with me!  Poor fellow! he is quite distracted by Jealousy, which 
I am not sorry for, as I know no better support of Love.  He has been teizing 
me to allow of his coming into this country, &amp; lodging somewhere near 
<hi>incog.</hi> — but I forbid anything of the kind.  Those women are 
inexcusable who forget what is due to themselves &amp; the opinion of the 
World.

            </q>
            <p>My dear Mother
</p>
            <p>Mr. Vernon returned on Thursday night, bringing his neice with him. 
Lady Susan had received a line from him by that day's post, informing her that 
Miss Summers had absolutely refused to allow of Miss Vernon's continuance in 
her Academy; we were therefore prepared for her arrival, &amp; expected them 
impatiently the whole evening.  They came while we were at Tea, &amp; I never 
saw any creature look so frightened in my life as Frederica when she entered 
the room.
</p>
            <p>Lady Susan, who had been shedding tears before, &amp; shewing great 
agitation at the idea of the meeting, received her with perfect self-command, 
&amp; without betraying the least tenderness of spirit.  She hardly spoke to 
her, &amp; on Frederica's bursting into tears as soon as we were seated, took 
her out of the room, &amp; did not return for some time.  When she did, her 
eyes looked very red, &amp; she was as much agitated as before.  We saw no 
more of her daughter.
</p>
            <p>Poor Reginald was beyond measure concerned to see his 
fair friend in such distress, &amp; watched her 
with so much tender solicitude, that I, who occasionally caught her observing 
his countenance with exultation, was quite out of patience.  This pathetic 
representation lasted the whole evening, &amp; so ostentatious &amp; artful a 
display had entirely convinced me that she did in fact feel nothing.
</p>
            <p>I am more angry with her than ever since I have seen her daughter; the poor 
girl looks so unhappy that my heart aches for her.  Lady Susan is surely too 
severe, for Frederica does not seem to have the sort of temper to make 
severity necessary.  She looks perfectly timid, dejected, &amp; penitent.
</p>
            <p>She is very pretty, tho' not so handsome as her Mother, nor at all like 
her.  Her complexion is delicate, but neither so fair nor so blooming as Lady 
Susan's — &amp; she has quite the Vernon cast of countenance, the oval face 
&amp; mild dark eyes, &amp; there is peculiar sweetness in her look when she 
speaks either to her Uncle or me, for as we behave kindly to her we have of 
course engaged her gratitude.  Her Mother has insinuated that her temper is 
untractable, but I never saw a face less indicative of any evil disposition 
than hers; &amp; from what I now see of the behaviour of each to the other, 
the invariable severity of Lady Susan &amp; the silent dejection of Frederica, 
I am led to beleive as heretofore that the former has no real Love for her 
daughter, &amp; has never done her justice or treated her affectionately.
</p>
            <p>I have not yet been able to have any conversation with my neice; she is 
shy, &amp; I think I can see that some pains are taken to prevent her being 
much with me.  Nothing satisfactory transpires as to her reason for running 
away.  Her kind-hearted Uncle, you may be sure, was too fearful of distressing 
her to ask many questions as they travelled.  I wish it had been possible for 
me to fetch her instead of him; I think I should have discovered the truth in 
the course of a Thirty-mile Journey.
</p>
            <p>The small Pianoforté has been removed within these few days, at Lady 
Susan's request, into her Dressing room, &amp; Frederica spends great part of 
the day there; <hi>practising</hi>, it is called; but I seldom hear any noise 
when I pass that way.  What she does with herself there, I do not know; there 
are plenty of books in the room, but it is not every girl who has been running 
wild the first fifteen years of her life, that can or will read.  Poor 
Creature! the prospect from her window is not very instructive, for that room 
overlooks the Lawn, you know, with the Shrubbery on one side, where she may see 
her Mother walking for an hour together in earnest conversation with Reginald. 
A girl of Frederica's age must be childish indeed, if such things do not strike 
her.  Is it not inexcusable to give such an example to a daughter?  Yet 
Reginald still thinks Lady Susan the best of Mothers — still condemns 
Frederica as a worthless girl!  He is convinced that her attempt to run away 
proceeded from no justifiable cause, &amp; had no provocation.  I am sure I 
cannot say that it <hi>had</hi>, but while Miss Summers declares that Miss 
Vernon shewed no signs of Obstinacy or Perverseness during her whole stay in 
Wigmore Street, till she was detected in this scheme, I cannot so readily 
credit what Lady Susan has made him &amp; wants to make me beleive, that it was 
merely an impatience of restraint &amp; a desire of escaping from the tuition 
of Masters which brought on the plan of an 
elopement.  Oh! Reginald, how is your Judgement enslaved!  He scarcely dares 
even allow her to be handsome, &amp; when I speak of her beauty, replies only 
that her eyes have no Brilliancy!
</p>
            <p>Sometimes he is sure she is deficient in Understanding, &amp; at others that 
her temper only is in fault.  In short, when a person is always to deceive, it 
is impossible to be consistent.  Lady Susan finds it necessary for her own 
justification that Frederica should be to blame, &amp; probably has sometimes 
judged it expedient to accuse her of ill-nature &amp; sometimes to lament her 
want of sense.  Reginald is only repeating after her Ladyship.
</p>
            <p>                             I am &amp;c.

            <p>My dear Madam
</p>
            <p>I am very glad to find that my description of Frederica Vernon has 
interested you, for I do beleive her truly deserving of your regard; &amp; when 
I have communicated a notion which has recently struck me, your kind 
impressions in her favour will, I am sure, be heightened.  I cannot help 
fancying that she is growing partial to my Brother; I so very often see her 
eyes fixed on his face with a remarkable expression of pensive admiration!  He 
is certainly very handsome; &amp; yet more, there is an openness in his manner 
that must be highly prepossessing, &amp; I am sure she feels it so.  Thoughtful 
&amp; pensive in general, her countenance always brightens into a smile when 
Reginald says anything amusing; and, let the subject be ever so serious that he 
may be conversing on, I am much mistaken if a syllable of his uttering escapes 
her.
</p>
            <p>I want to make <hi>him</hi> sensible of all this, for we know the power of 
gratitude on such a heart as his; &amp; could Frederica's artless affection 
detach him from her Mother, we might bless the day which brought her to 
Churchill.  I think, my dear Madam, you would not disapprove of her as a 
Daughter.  She is extremely young, to be sure, has had a wretched Education, 
&amp; a dreadful example of Levity in her Mother; but yet I can pronounce her 
disposition to be excellent, &amp; her natural abilities very good.  Though 
totally without accomplishments, she 
is by no means so ignorant as one might expect to find her, being fond of books 
&amp; spending the cheif of her time in reading.  Her Mother leaves her more to 
herself now than she <hi>did</hi>, &amp; I have her with me as much as 
possible, &amp; have taken great pains to overcome her timidity.  We are very 
good friends, &amp; tho' she never opens her lips before her Mother, she talks 
enough when alone with me to make it clear that, if properly treated by Lady 
Susan, she would always appear to much greater advantage.  There cannot be a 
more gentle, affectionate heart; or more obliging manners, when acting without 
restraint.  Her little Cousins are all very fond of her.

            </q>
            <p>You will be eager, I know, to hear something farther of Frederica, &amp; 
perhaps may think me negligent for not writing before.  She arrived with her 
Uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of course, I lost no time in demanding the 
reason of her behaviour; &amp; soon found myself to have been perfectly right 
in attributing it to my own letter.  The purport of it frightened her so 
thoroughly that, with a mixture of true girlish perverseness &amp; folly, 
without considering that she could not escape from my authority by running away 
from Wigmore Street, she resolved on getting out of the house &amp; proceeding 
directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; &amp; had really got as far 
as the length of two streets in her journey when she was fortunately miss'd, 
pursued, &amp; overtaken.
</p>
            <p>Such was the first distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Susanna Vernon; 
&amp; if we consider that it was achieved at the tender age of sixteen, we 
shall have room for the most flattering prognostics of her future renown.  I am 
excessively provoked, however, at the parade of propriety which prevented Miss 
Summers from keeping the girl; &amp; it seems so extraordinary a piece of 
nicety, considering my daughter's family connections, that I can only suppose 
the Lady to be governed by the fear of never getting her money.  Be that as it 
may, however, Frederica is returned on my hands; and having now nothing else to 
employ her, is busy in pursuing the plan of Romance begun at Langford.  She is 
actually falling in love with Reginald De Courcy!  To disobey her Mother by 
refusing an unexceptionable offer is not enough; her affections must likewise 
be given without her Mother's approbation.  I never saw a girl of her age bid 
fairer to be the sport of Mankind.  Her feelings are tolerably acute, &amp; she 
is so charmingly artless in their display as to afford the most reasonable hope 
of her being ridiculed &amp; despised by every Man who sees her.
</p>
            <p>Artlessness will never do in Love matters; &amp; that girl is born a 
simpleton who has it either by nature or affectation.  I am not yet certain 
that Reginald sees what she is about; nor is it of much consequence.  She is 
now an object of indifference to him; she would be one of contempt were he to 
understand her Emotions.  Her beauty is much admired by the Vernons, but it has 
no effect on <hi>him</hi>.  She is in high favour with her Aunt altogether — 
because she is so little like myself, of course.  She is exactly the companion 
for Mrs. Vernon, who dearly loves to be first, &amp; to have all the sense 
&amp; all the wit of the Conversation to herself: Frederica will never eclipse 
her.  When she first came, I was at some pains to prevent her seeing much of 
her Aunt; but I have since relaxed, as I beleive I may depend on her observing 
the rules I have laid down for their discourse.
</p>
            <p>But do not imagine that with all this Lenity I have for a moment given up my 
plan of her marriage; No, I am unalterably fixed on this point, tho' I have not 
yet quite decided on the manner of bringing it about.  I should not chuse to 
have the business brought forward here, &amp; canvassed by the wise heads of 
Mr. &amp; Mrs. Vernon; &amp; I cannot just now afford to go to Town. 
Miss Frederica therefore must wait a little.
</p>

               <l>
                  <hi>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy.</hi>

               <l/>
               <l>                                          Churchill. </l>
            </q>
            <p>We have a very unexpected Guest with us at present, my dear Mother.  He 
arrived yesterday.  I heard a carriage at the door, as I was sitting with my 
children while they dined; &amp; supposing I should be wanted, left the Nursery 
soon afterwards, &amp; was half-way downstairs, when Frederica, as pale as 
ashes, came running up, &amp; rushed by me into her own room.  I instantly 
followed, &amp; asked her what was the matter.  "Oh!" cried she, "he is come, 
Sir James is come — &amp; what am I to do?"  This was no explanation; I begged 
her to tell me what she meant.  At that moment we were interrupted by a knock 
at the door: it was Reginald, who came, by Lady Susan's direction, to call 
Frederica down.  "It is Mr. De Courcy!" said she, colouring violently. 
"Mamma has sent for me, &amp; I must go."  We all three went down together; 
&amp; I saw my Brother examining the terrified face of Frederica with surprise. 
In the breakfast-room we found Lady Susan, &amp; a young Man of genteel 
appearance, whom she introduced to me by the name of Sir James Martin — the 
very person, as you may remember, whom it was said she had been at pains to 
detach from Miss Manwaring.  But the conquest, it seems, was not designed for 
herself, or she has since transferred it to her daughter; for Sir James is now 
desperately in love with Frederica, &amp; with full encouragement from Mama. 
The poor girl, however, I am sure, dislikes him; &amp; tho' his person &amp; 
address are very well, he appears, both to Mr. Vernon &amp; me, a very weak 
young Man.
</p>
            <p>Frederica looked so shy, so confused, when we entered the room, that I felt 
for her exceedingly.  Lady Susan behaved with great attention to her Visitor; 
&amp; yet I thought I could perceive that she had no particular pleasure in 
seeing him.  Sir James talked a great deal, &amp; made many civil excuses to me 
for the liberty he had taken in coming to Churchill — mixing more frequent 
laughter with his discourse than the subject required — said many things over 
&amp; over again, &amp; told Lady Susan three times that he had seen 
Mrs. Johnson a few Evenings before.  He now &amp; then addressed Frederica, 
but more frequently her Mother.  The poor girl sat all this time without 
opening her lips — her eyes cast down, &amp; her colour varying every instant; 
while Reginald observed all that passed in perfect silence.
</p>
            <p>At length Lady Susan, weary I beleive of her situation, proposed walking; 
&amp; we left the two gentlemen together, to put on our Pelisses.
</p>
            <p>As we went upstairs, Lady Susan begged permission to attend me for a few 
moments in my Dressing room, as she was anxious to speak with me in private.  I 
led her thither accordingly, &amp; as soon as the door was closed, she said, "I 
was never more surprised in my life than by Sir James's arrival, &amp; the 
suddenness of it requires some apology to <hi>You</hi>, my dear Sister; tho' to 
<hi>me</hi>, as a Mother, it is highly flattering.  He is so extremely attached 
to my Daughter that he could not exist longer without seeing her.  Sir James is 
a young man of an amiable disposition &amp; excellent character; a little too 
much of the <hi>Rattle</hi>, perhaps, but a year or two 
will rectify <hi>that</hi>; &amp; he is in other respects so very eligible a 
Match for Frederica, that I have always observed his attachment with the 
greatest pleasure, &amp; am persuaded that you &amp; my Brother will give the 
alliance your hearty approbation.  I have never before mentioned the likelihood 
of its taking place to any one, because I thought that while Frederica 
continued at school it had better not be known to exist; but now, as I am 
convinced that Frederica is too old ever to submit to school confinement, &amp; 
have therefore begun to consider her union with Sir James as not very distant, 
I had intended within a few days to acquaint yourself &amp; Mr. Vernon with 
the whole business.  I am sure, my dear Sister, you will excuse my remaining 
silent so long, &amp; agree with me that such circumstances, while they 
continue from any cause in suspense, cannot be too cautiously concealed.  When 
you have the happiness of bestowing your sweet little Catherine, some years 
hence, on a Man who in connection &amp; character is alike unexceptionable, you 
will know what I feel now; tho' Thank Heaven!  you cannot have all my reasons 
for rejoicing in such an Event.  Catherine will be amply provided for, &amp; 
not, like my Frederica, indebted to a fortunate Establishment for the comforts 
of Life."
</p>
            <p>She concluded by demanding my congratulations.  I gave them somewhat 
awkwardly, I beleive; for in fact, the sudden disclosure of so important a 
matter took from me the power of speaking with any clearness.  She thanked me, 
however, most affectionately, for my kind concern in the welfare of herself 
&amp; daughter; &amp; then said,
</p>
            <p>"I am not apt to deal in professions, my dear Mrs. Vernon, &amp; I never 
had the convenient talent of affecting sensations foreign to my heart; &amp; 
therefore I trust you will beleive me when I declare that, much as I had heard 
in your praise before I knew you, I had no idea that I should ever love you as 
I now do; &amp; I must further say that your friendship towards me is more 
particularly gratifying because I have reason to beleive that some attempts 
were made to prejudice you against me.  I only wish that They — whoever they 
are — to whom I am indebted for such kind intentions, could see the terms on 
which we now are together, &amp; understand the real affection we feel for each 
other!  But I will not detain you any longer.  God bless you for your goodness 
to me &amp; my girl, &amp; continue to you all your present happiness."
</p>
            <p>What can one say of such a Woman, my dear Mother?  Such earnestness, such 
solemnity of expression! &amp; yet I cannot help suspecting the truth of 
everything she said.
</p>
            <p>As for Reginald, I beleive he does not know what to make of the matter. 
When Sir James first came, he appeared all astonishment &amp; perplexity.  The 
folly of the young Man &amp; the confusion of Frederica entirely engrossed him; 
&amp; tho' a little private discourse with Lady Susan has since had its effect, 
he is still hurt, I am sure, at her allowing of such a Man's attentions to her 
daughter.
</p>
            <p>Sir James invited himself with great composure to remain here a few days — 
hoped we would not think it odd, was aware of its being very impertinent, but 
he took the liberty of a relation; &amp; concluded by wishing, with a laugh, 
that he might be really one soon.  Even Lady Susan seemed a little disconcerted 
by this forwardness; in her heart, I am persuaded, she sincerely wishes him 
gone.
</p>
            <p>But something must be done for this poor Girl, if her feelings are such as 
both her Uncle &amp; I beleive them to be.  She must not be sacrificed to 
Policy or Ambition; she must not be even left to suffer from the dread of it. 
The Girl whose heart can distinguish Reginald De Courcy deserves, however he 
may slight her, a better fate than to be Sir James Martin's wife.  As soon as I 
can get her alone, I will discover the real Truth; but she seems to wish to 
avoid me.  I hope this does not proceed from anything wrong, &amp; that I shall 
not find out I have thought too well of her.  Her behaviour to Sir James 
certainly speaks the greatest consciousness &amp; Embarrassment, but I see 
nothing in it more like Encouragement.
</p>
            <p>Adieu, my dear Madam.

            <p>Sir,
</p>
            <p>I hope you will excuse this liberty; I am forced upon it by the greatest 
distress, or I should be ashamed to trouble you.  I am very miserable about Sir 
James Martin, &amp; have no other way in the world of helping myself but by 
writing to you, for I am forbidden ever speaking to my Uncle or Aunt on the 
subject; &amp; this being the case, I am afraid my applying to you will appear 
no better than equivocation, &amp; as if I attended only to the letter &amp; 
not the spirit of Mama's commands.  But if <hi>you</hi> do not take my part 
&amp; persuade her to break it off, I shall be half distracted, for I cannot 
bear him.  No human Being but <hi>you</hi> could have any chance of prevailing 
with her.  If you will, therefore, have the unspeakable great kindness of 
taking my part with her, &amp; persuading her to send Sir James away, I shall 
be more obliged to you than it is possible for me to express.  I always 
disliked him from the first; it is not a sudden fancy, I assure you, Sir; I 
always thought him silly &amp; impertinent &amp; disagreable, &amp; now he is 
grown worse than ever.  I would rather work 
for my bread than marry him.  I do not know how to apologize enough for 
this Letter; I know it is taking so great a liberty; I am aware how dreadfully 
angry it will make Mama, but I must run the risk.  I am, Sir, your most Humble 
Servt.

               <l>                                            Churchill. </l>
            </q>
            <p>This is insufferable!  My dearest friend, I was never so enraged before, 
&amp; must relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will enter into all my 
feelings.  Who should come on Tuesday but Sir James Martin!  Guess my 
astonishment &amp; vexation — for, as you well know, I never wished him to be 
seen at Churchill.  What a pity that you should not have known his intentions! 
Not content with coming, he actually invited himself to remain here a few days. 
I could have poisoned him!  I made the best of it, however, &amp; told my story 
with great success to Mrs. Vernon, who, whatever might be her real 
sentiments, said nothing in opposition to mine.  I made a point also of 
Frederica's behaving civilly to Sir James, &amp; gave her to understand that I 
was absolutely determined on her marrying him.  She said something of her 
misery, but that was all.  I have for some time been more particularly resolved 
on the Match from seeing the rapid increase of her affection for Reginald, 
&amp; from not feeling perfectly secure that a knowledge of <hi>that</hi>
affection might not in the end awaken a return.  Contemptible as a regard 
founded only on compassion must make them both in my eyes, I felt by no means 
assured that such might not be the consequence.  It is true that Reginald had 
not in any degree grown cool towards me; but yet he had lately mentioned 
Frederica spontaneously &amp; unnecessarily, &amp; once had said something in 
praise of her person.
</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> was all astonishment at the appearance of my visitor, &amp; at 
first observed Sir James with an attention which I was pleased to see not 
unmixed with jealousy; but unluckily it was impossible for me really to torment 
him, as Sir James, tho' extremely gallant to me, very soon made the whole party 
understand that his heart was devoted to my daughter.
</p>
            <p>I had no great difficulty in convincing De Courcy, when we were alone, that 
I was perfectly justified, all things considered, in desiring the match; &amp; 
the whole business seemed most comfortably arranged.  They could none of them 
help perceiving that Sir James was no Solomon; but I had positively forbidden 
Frederica's complaining to Charles Vernon or his wife, &amp; they had therefore 
no pretence for Interference; tho' my impertinent Sister, I beleive, wanted 
only opportunity for doing so.
</p>
            <p>Everything, however, was going on calmly &amp; quietly; &amp; tho' I counted 
the hours of Sir James's stay, my mind was entirely satisfied with the posture 
of affairs.  Guess, then, what I must feel at the sudden disturbance of all my 
schemes; &amp; that, too, from a quarter whence I had least reason to apprehend 
it.  Reginald came this morning into my Dressing room with a very unusual 
solemnity of countenance, &amp; after some preface informed me in so many words 
that he wished to reason with me on the Impropriety &amp; Unkindness of 
allowing Sir James Martin to address my Daughter contrary to <hi>her</hi>
inclination.  I was all amazement.  When I found that he was not to be laughed 
out of his design, I calmly required an explanation, &amp; begged to know by 
what he was impelled, &amp; by whom commissioned to reprimand me.  He then told 
me, mixing in his speech a few insolent compliments, &amp; ill-timed 
expressions of Tenderness, to which I listened with perfect indifference, that 
my daughter had acquainted him with some circumstances concerning herself, Sir 
James, &amp; me, which gave him great uneasiness.
</p>
            <p>In short, I found that she had in the first place actually written to him 
to request his interference, &amp; that on receiving her Letter, he had 
conversed with her on the subject of it, in order to understand the 
particulars, &amp; assure himself of her real wishes!
</p>
            <p>I have not a doubt but that the girl took this opportunity of making 
downright Love to him.  I am convinced of it from the manner in which he spoke 
of her.  Much good may such Love do him!  I shall ever despise the Man who can 
be gratified by the Passion which he never wished to inspire, nor solicited the 
avowal of.  I shall always detest them both.  He can have no true regard for 
me, or he would not have listened to her; and she, with her little rebellious 
heart &amp; indelicate feelings, to throw herself into the protection of a 
young Man with whom she has scarcely ever exchanged two words before!  I am 
equally confounded at <hi>her</hi> Impudence &amp; <hi>his</hi> Credulity.  How 
dared he beleive what she told him in my disfavour!  Ought he not to have felt 
assured that I must have unanswerable Motives for all that I had done?  Where 
was his reliance on my Sense &amp; Goodness then?  Where the resentment which 
true Love would have dictated against the person defaming me — that person, 
too, a Chit, a Child, without Talent or Education, whom he had been always 
taught to despise?
</p>
            <p>I was calm for some time; but the greatest degree of Forbearance may be 
overcome, &amp; I hope I was afterwards sufficiently keen.  He endeavoured, 
long endeavoured, to soften my resentment; but that woman is a fool indeed who, 
while insulted by accusation, can be worked on by compliments.  At length he 
left me, as deeply provoked as myself; &amp; he shewed his anger <hi>more</hi>. 
I was quite cool, but he gave way to the most violent indignation.  I may 
therefore expect it will the sooner subside; &amp; perhaps his may be vanished 
forever, while mine will be found still fresh &amp; implacable.
</p>
            <p>He is now shut up in his apartment, whither I heard him go on leaving mine. 
How unpleasant, one would think, must his reflections be!  But some people's 
feelings are incomprehensible.  I have not yet tranquillized myself enough to 
see Frederica.  <hi>She</hi> shall not soon forget the occurrences of this day; 
she shall find that she has poured forth her tender Tale of Love in vain, &amp; 
exposed herself forever to the contempt of the whole world, &amp; the severest 
Resentment of her injured Mother.

            </q>
            <p>Let me congratulate you, my dearest Mother!  The affair which has given us 
so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion.  Our prospect is most 
delightful; &amp; since matters have now taken so favourable a turn, I am 
quite sorry that I ever imparted my apprehensions to you; for the pleasure of 
learning that the danger is over is perhaps dearly purchased by all that you 
have previously suffered.
</p>
            <p>I am so much agitated by Delight that I can scarcely hold a pen; but am 
determined to send you a few short lines by James, that you may have some 
explanation of what must so greatly astonish you, as that Reginald should be 
returning to Parklands.
</p>
            <p>I was sitting about half an hour ago with Sir James in the Breakfast 
parlour, when my Brother called me out of the room.  I instantly saw that 
something was the matter; his complexion was raised, &amp; he spoke with great 
emotion.  You know his eager manner, my dear Madam, when his mind is 
interested.
</p>
            <p>"Catherine," said he, "I am going home today; I am sorry to leave you, but I 
must go.  It is a great while since I have seen my Father &amp; Mother.  I am 
going to send James forward with my Hunters immediately; 
if you have any Letter, therefore, he can take it.  I shall not be at home 
myself till Wednesday or Thursday, as I shall go through London, where I have 
business.  But before I leave you," he continued, speaking in a lower voice, 
&amp; with still greater energy, "I must warn you of one thing — do not let 
Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that Martin.  He wants to marry her — her 
Mother promotes the Match — but <hi>she</hi> cannot endure the idea of it.  Be 
assured that I speak from the fullest conviction of the Truth of what I say; I 
<hi>know</hi> that Frederica is made wretched by Sir James' continuing here. 
She is a sweet girl, &amp; deserves a better fate.  Send him away immediately. 
<hi>He</hi> is only a fool — but what her Mother can mean, Heaven only knows! 
Good-bye," he added, shaking my hand with earnestness — "I do not know when 
you will see me again; but remember what I tell you of Frederica; you 
<hi>must</hi> make it your business to see justice done her.  She is an amiable 
girl, &amp; has a very superior Mind to what we have ever given her credit 
for."
</p>
            <p>He then left me, &amp; ran upstairs.  I would not try to stop him, for I 
know what his feelings must be; the nature of mine, as I listened to him, I 
need not attempt to describe.  For a minute or two, I remained in the same 
spot, overpowered by wonder — of a most agreable sort indeed; yet it required 
some consideration to be tranquilly happy.
</p>
            <p>In about ten minutes after my return to the parlour, Lady Susan entered the 
room.  I concluded, of course, that she &amp; Reginald had been quarrelling, 
&amp; looked with anxious curiosity for a confirmation of my beleif in her 
face.  Mistress of Deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, &amp; 
after chatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, "I find 
from Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy — is it true that he 
leaves Churchill this morning?"  I replied that it was.  "He told us nothing 
of all this last night," said she, laughing, "or even this morning at 
Breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it himself.  Young Men are often hasty 
in their resolutions — &amp; not more sudden in forming than unsteady in 
keeping them.  I should not be surprised if he were to change his mind at 
last, &amp; not go."  She soon afterwards left the room.  I trust, however, my 
dear Mother, that we have no reason to fear an alteration of his present plan; 
things have gone too far.  They must have quarrelled, &amp; about Frederica 
too.  Her calmness astonishes me.  What delight will be yours in seeing him 
again, in seeing him still worthy of your Esteem, still capable of forming 
your Happiness!
</p>
            <p>When I next write, I shall be able, I hope, to tell you that Sir James is 
gone, Lady Susan vanquished, &amp; Frederica at peace.  We have much to do, 
but it shall be done.  I am all impatience to hear how this astonishing change 
was effected.  I finish as I began, with the warmest congratulations.

            </q>
            <p>Little did I imagine, my dear Mother, when I sent off my last letter, that 
the delightful perturbation of spirits I was then in would undergo so speedy, 
so melancholy a reverse!  I never can sufficiently regret that I wrote to you 
at all.  Yet who could have foreseen what has happened?  My dear Mother, every 
hope which but two hours ago made me so happy is vanished.  The quarrel 
between Lady Susan &amp; Reginald is made up, &amp; we are all as we were 
before.  One point only is gained; Sir James Martin is dismissed.  What are we 
now to look forward to?  I am indeed disappointed.  Reginald was all but gone, 
his horse was ordered &amp; all but brought to the door!  Who would not have 
felt safe?
</p>
            <p>For half an hour, I was in momentary expectation of his departure.  After I 
had sent off my Letter to you, I went to Mr. Vernon, &amp; sat with him in 
his room talking over the whole matter.  I then determined to look for 
Frederica, whom I had not seen since breakfast.  I met her on the stairs, &amp; 
saw that she was crying.
</p>
            <p>"My dear Aunt," said she, "he is going — Mr. De Courcy is going, &amp; 
it is all my fault.  I am afraid you will be angry, but indeed I had no idea it 
would end so."
</p>
            <p>"My Love," replied I, "do not think it necessary to apologize to me on that 
account.  I shall feel myself under an obligation to any one who is the means 
of sending my brother home, because," recollecting myself, "I know my Father 
wants very much to see him.  But what is it that <hi>you</hi> have done to 
occasion all this?"
</p>
            <p>She blushed deeply as she answered, "I was so unhappy about Sir James that I 
could not help — I have done something very wrong I know — but you have not 
an idea of the misery I have been in, &amp; Mama had ordered me never to speak 
to you or my Uncle about it, — &amp; —" "You therefore spoke to my Brother, 
to engage <hi>his</hi> interference," said I, to save her the explanation. 
"No; but I wrote to him — I did indeed.  I got up this morning before it was 
light — I was two hours about it — &amp; when my Letter was done, I thought I 
never should have courage to give it.  After breakfast, however, as I was going 
to my room, I met him in the passage, &amp; then, as I knew that everything 
must depend on that moment, I forced myself to give it.  He was so good as to 
take it immediately.  I dared not look at him, &amp; ran away directly.  I was 
in such a fright that I could hardly breathe.  My dear Aunt, you do not know 
how miserable I have been."
</p>
            <p>"Frederica," said I, "you ought to have told <hi>me</hi> all your 
distresses.  You would have found in me a friend always ready to assist you. 
Do you think that your Uncle &amp; I should not have espoused your cause as 
warmly as my Brother?"
</p>
            <p>"Indeed, I did not doubt your goodness," said she, colouring again, "but I 
thought Mr. De Courcy could do anything with my Mother; but I was mistaken: 
they have had a dreadful quarrel about it, &amp; he is going.  Mama will never 
forgive me, &amp; I shall be worse off than ever."  "No, you shall not," 
replied I. — "In such a point as this, your Mother's prohibition ought not to 
have prevented your speaking to me on the subject.  She has no right to make 
you unhappy, &amp; she shall <hi>not</hi> do it.  Your applying, however, to 
Reginald can be productive only of Good to all parties.  I beleive it is best 
as it is.  Depend upon it that you shall not be made unhappy any longer."
</p>
            <p>At that moment, how great was my astonishment at seeing Reginald come out of 
Lady Susan's Dressing room.  My heart misgave me instantly.  His confusion on 
seeing me was very evident.  Frederica immediately disappeared.  "Are you 
going?" said I. "You will find Mr. Vernon in his own room."  "No, 
Catherine," replied he, "I am <hi>not</hi> going.  Will you let me speak to you 
a moment?"
</p>
            <p>We went into my room.  "I find," continued he, his confusion increasing as 
he spoke, "that I have been acting with my usual foolish impetuosity.  I have 
entirely misunderstood Lady Susan, &amp; was on the point of leaving the house 
under a false impression of her conduct.  There has been some very great 
mistake — we have been all mistaken, I fancy.  Frederica does not know her 
Mother — Lady Susan means nothing but her Good — but Frederica will not make 
a friend of her.  Lady Susan therefore does not always know what will make her 
daughter happy.  Besides, <hi>I</hi> could have no right to interfere — Miss 
Vernon was mistaken in applying to me.  In short, Catherine, everything has 
gone wrong — but it is now all happily settled.  Lady Susan, I beleive, wishes 
to speak to you about it, if you are at leisure."
</p>
            <p>"Certainly," replied I, deeply sighing at the recital of so lame a story.  I 
made no comments, however, for words would have been vain.
</p>
            <p>Reginald was glad to get away; &amp; I went to Lady Susan; curious, indeed, 
to hear her account of it.  "Did I not tell you," said she, with a smile, "that 
your Brother would not leave us after all?"  "You did, indeed," replied I, very 
gravely; "but I flattered myself that you would be mistaken."  "I should not 
have hazarded such an opinion," returned she, "if it had not at that moment 
occurred to me that his resolution of going might be occasioned by a 
Conversation in which we had been this morning engaged, &amp; which had ended 
very much to his Dissatisfaction, from our not rightly understanding each 
other's meaning.  This idea struck me at the moment, &amp; I instantly 
determined that an accidental dispute, in which I might probably be as much to 
blame as himself, should not deprive you of your Brother.  If you remember, I 
left the room almost immediately.  I was resolved to lose no time in clearing 
up those mistakes as far as I could.  The case was this: Frederica had set 
herself violently against marrying Sir James —" "And can your Ladyship wonder 
that she should?"  cried I, with some warmth; "Frederica has an excellent 
Understanding, &amp; Sir James has none."  "I am at least very far from 
regretting it, my dear sister," said she; "on the contrary, I am grateful for 
so favourable a sign of my Daughter's sense.  Sir James is certainly under par 
— (his boyish manners make him appear the worse) — &amp; had Frederica 
possessed the penetration, the abilities which I could have wished in my 
Daughter, or had I even known her to possess as much as she does, I should not 
have been anxious for the match."  "It is odd that you should alone be ignorant 
of your Daughter's sense."  "Frederica never does justice to herself; her 
manners are shy &amp; childish.  She is besides afraid of me; she scarcely 
loves me.  During her poor Father's life she was a spoilt child; the severity 
which it has since been necessary for me to shew has alienated her affection; 
neither has she any of that Brilliancy of Intellect, that Genius, or Vigour of 
Mind which will force itself forward."  "Say rather that she has been 
unfortunate in her education!"  "Heaven knows, my dearest Mrs. Vernon, how 
fully I am aware of <hi>that</hi>; but I would wish to forget every 
circumstance that might throw blame on the memory of one whose name is sacred 
with me."
</p>
            <p>Here she pretended to cry; I was out of patience with her.  "But what," said 
I, "was your Ladyship going to tell me about your disagreement with my 
Brother?"  "It originated in an action of my Daughter's which equally marks her 
want of Judgement &amp; the unfortunate Dread of me I have been mentioning — 
she wrote to Mr. De Courcy."  "I know she did; you had forbidden her 
speaking to Mr. Vernon or to me on the cause of her distress; what could 
she do, therefore, but apply to my Brother?"  "Good God!" she exclaimed, "what 
an opinion you must have of me!  Can you possibly suppose that I was aware of 
her unhappiness? that it was my object to make my own child miserable, &amp; 
that I had forbidden her speaking to you on the subject from fear of your 
interrupting the Diabolical scheme?  Do you think me destitute of every honest, 
every natural feeling?  Am I capable of consigning <hi>her</hi> to everlasting 
Misery whose welfare it is my first Earthly Duty to promote?"  "The idea is 
horrible.  What, then, was your intention when you insisted on her silence?" 
"Of what use, my dear Sister, could be any application to you, however the 
affair might stand?  Why should I subject you to entreaties which I refused to 
attend to myself?  Neither for your sake, for hers, nor for my own, could 
such a thing be desirable.  When my own resolution was taken, I could not wish 
for the interference, however friendly, of another person.  I was mistaken, it 
is true, but I beleived myself right."  "But what was this mistake to which 
your Ladyship so often alludes? From whence arose so astonishing a 
misconception of your Daughter's feelings?  Did you not know that she disliked 
Sir James?"  "I knew that he was not absolutely the Man she would have chosen, 
but I was persuaded that her objections to him did not arise from any 
perception of his Deficiency.  You must not question me, however, my dear 
Sister, too minutely on this point," continued she, taking me affectionately by 
the hand; "I honestly own that there is something to conceal.  Frederica makes 
me very unhappy!  Her applying to Mr. De Courcy hurt me particularly." 
"What is it you mean to infer," said I, "by this appearance of mystery?  If you 
think your Daughter at all attached to Reginald, her objecting to Sir James 
could not less deserve to be attended to than if the cause of her objecting had 
been a consciousness of his folly; &amp; why should your Ladyship, at any rate, 
quarrel with my Brother for an interference which you must know it is not in 
his nature to refuse when urged in such a manner?"
</p>
            <p>"His disposition, you know, is warm, &amp; he came to expostulate with me; 
his compassion all alive for this ill-used Girl, this Heroine in distress!  We 
misunderstood each other: he beleived me more to blame than I really was; I 
considered his interference less excusable than I now find it.  I have a real 
regard for him, &amp; was beyond expression mortified to find it, as I 
thought, so ill bestowed.  We were both warm, &amp; of course both to blame. 
His resolution of leaving Churchill is consistent with his general eagerness. 
When I understood his intention, however, &amp; at the same time began to 
think that we had been perhaps equally mistaken in each other's meaning, I 
resolved to have an explanation before it was too late.  For any Member of 
your Family I must always feel a degree of affection, &amp; I own it would 
have sensibly hurt me if my acquaintance with Mr. De Courcy had ended so 
gloomily.  I have now only to say farther, that as I am convinced of 
Frederica's having a reasonable dislike to Sir James, I shall instantly inform 
him that he must give up all hope of her.  I reproach myself for having ever, 
tho' innocently, made her unhappy on that score.  She shall have all the 
retribution in my power to make; if she value her own happiness as much as I 
do, if she judge wisely, &amp; command herself as she ought, she may now be 
easy.  Excuse me, my dearest Sister, for thus trespassing on your time, but I 
owed it to my own Character; &amp; after this explanation I trust I am in no 
danger of sinking in your opinion."
</p>
            <p>I could have said, "Not much, indeed!" but I left her almost in silence. 
It was the greatest stretch of Forbearance I could practise.  I could not have 
stopped myself had I begun.  Her assurance, her Deceit — but I will not allow 
myself to dwell on them; they will strike you sufficiently.  My heart sickens 
within me.
</p>
            <p>As soon as I was tolerably composed I returned to the Parlour.  Sir James's 
carriage was at the door, &amp; he, merry as usual, soon afterwards took his 
leave.  How easily does her Ladyship encourage or dismiss a Lover!
</p>
            <p>In spite of this release, Frederica still looks unhappy, still fearful, 
perhaps, of her Mother's anger; &amp; tho' dreading my Brother's departure, 
jealous, it may be, of his staying.  I see how closely she observes him &amp; 
Lady Susan.  Poor Girl, I have now no hope for her.  There is not a chance of 
her affection being returned.  He thinks very differently of her from what he 
used to do, he does her some justice, but his reconciliation with her Mother 
precludes every dearer hope.
</p>
            <p>Prepare, my dear Madam, for the worst.  The probability of their marrying 
is surely heightened.  He is more securely hers than ever.  When that wretched 
Event takes place, Frederica must wholly belong to us.
</p>
            <p>I am thankful that my last Letter will precede this by so little, as every 
moment that you can be saved from feeling a Joy which leads only to 
disappointment is of consequence.

               <l>                                          Churchill. </l>
            </q>
            <p>I call on you, dear Alicia, for congratulations: I am again myself; — gay 
and triumphant!  When I wrote to you the other day I was, in truth, in high 
irritation, and with ample cause.  Nay, I know not whether I ought to be quite 
tranquil now, for I have had more trouble in restoring peace than I ever 
intended to submit to — a spirit, too, resulting from a fancied sense of 
superior Integrity, which is peculiarly insolent!  I shall not easily forgive 
him, I assure you.  He was actually on the point of leaving Churchill!  I had 
scarcely concluded my last, when Wilson brought me word of it.  I found, 
therefore, that something must be done; for I did not chuse to leave my 
character at the mercy of a Man whose passions are so violent and resentful. 
It would have been trifling with my reputation to allow of his departing with 
such an impression in my disfavour; in this light, condescension was 
necessary.
</p>
            <p>I sent Wilson to say that I desired to speak with him before he went; he 
came immediately.  The angry emotions which had marked every feature when we 
last parted were partially subdued.  He seemed astonished at the summons, 
&amp; looked as if half wishing &amp; half fearing to be softened by what I 
might say.
</p>
            <p>If my Countenance expressed what I aimed at, it was composed and dignified 
— and yet with a degree of pensiveness which might convince him that I was 
not quite happy.  "I beg your pardon Sir, for the liberty I have taken in 
sending for you, said I; but as I have just learnt your intention of leaving 
this place to-day, I feel it my duty to entreat that you will not on my 
account shorten your visit here even an hour.  I am perfectly aware that after 
what has passed between us it would ill suit the feelings of either to remain 
longer in the same house: so very great, so total a change from the intimacy 
of Friendship must render any future intercourse the severest punishment; 
&amp; your resolution of quitting Churchill is undoubtedly in unison with our 
situation, &amp; with those lively feelings which I know you to possess.  But 
at the same time it is not for me to suffer such a sacrifice as it must be to 
leave Relations to whom you are so much attached &amp; are so dear.  My 
remaining here cannot give that pleasure to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Vernon which your 
society must; &amp; my visit has already perhaps been too long.  My removal, 
therefore, which must at any rate take place soon, may with perfect 
convenience be hastened; &amp; I make it my particular request that I may not 
in any way be instrumental in separating a family so affectionately attached 
to each other.  Where <hi>I</hi> go is of no consequence to any one; of very little to 
myself; but <hi>you</hi> are of importance to all your connections."  Here I concluded, 
&amp; I hope you will be satisfied with my speech.  Its effect on Reginald 
justifies some portion of vanity, for it was no less favourable than 
instantaneous.  Oh, how delightful it was to watch the variations of his 
Countenance while I spoke! to see the struggle between returning Tenderness 
&amp; the remains of Displeasure.  There is something agreable in feelings so 
easily worked on; not that I envy him their possession, nor would, for the 
world, have such myself; but they are very convenient when one wishes to 
influence the passions of another.  And yet this Reginald, whom a very few 
words from me softened at once into the utmost submission, &amp; rendered more 
tractable, more attached, more devoted than ever, would have left me in the 
first angry swelling of his proud heart without deigning to seek an 
explanation.
</p>
            <p>Humbled as he now is, I cannot forgive him such an instance of pride, &amp; 
am doubtful whether I ought not to punish him by dismissing him at once after 
this reconciliation, or by marrying &amp; teizing him for ever.  But these 
measures are each too violent to be adopted without some deliberation; at 
present my Thoughts are fluctuating between various schemes.  I have many 
things to compass: I must punish Frederica, &amp; pretty severely too, for her 
application to Reginald; I must punish him for receiving it so favourably, 
&amp; for the rest of his conduct.  I must torment my Sister-in-law for the 
insolent triumph of her Look &amp; Manner since Sir James has been dismissed; 
for in reconciling Reginald to me, I was not able to save that ill-fated young 
Man; — &amp; I must make myself amends for the humiliation to which I have 
stooped within these few days.  To effect all this I have various plans.  I 
have also an idea of being soon in Town; &amp; whatever may be my determination 
as to the rest, I shall probably put <hi>that</hi> project in execution — for 
London will always be the fairest field of action, however my views may be 
directed; &amp; at any rate I shall there be rewarded by your society, &amp; a 
little Dissipation, for a ten weeks' penance at Churchill.
</p>
            <p>I beleive I owe it to my own Character to complete the match between my 
daughter &amp; Sir James, after having so long intended it.  Let me know your 
opinion on this point.  Flexibility of Mind, a Disposition easily biassed by 
others, is an attribute which you know I am not very desirous of obtaining; 
nor has Frederica any claim to the indulgence of her notions at the expense of 
her Mother's inclination.  Her idle Love for Reginald, too!  It is surely my 
duty to discourage such romantic nonsense.  All things considered, therefore, 
it seems incumbent on me to take her to Town &amp; marry her immediately to 
Sir James.
</p>
            <p>When my own will is effected contrary to his, I shall have some credit in 
being on good terms with Reginald, which at present, in fact, I have not; for 
tho' he is still in my power, I have given up the very article by which our 
quarrel was produced, &amp; at best the honour of victory is doubtful.
</p>
            <p>Send me your opinion on all these matters, my dear Alicia, &amp; let me 
know whether you can get lodgings to suit me within a short distance of 
you.

            <p>I am gratified by your reference, &amp; this is my advice: that you come to 
Town yourself, without loss of time, but that you leave Frederica behind.  It 
would surely be much more to the purpose to get yourself well established by 
marrying Mr. De Courcy, than to irritate him &amp; the rest of his family 
by making her marry Sir James.  You should think more of yourself &amp; less of 
your Daughter.  She is not of a disposition to do you credit in the World, 
&amp; seems precisely in her proper place at Churchill, with the Vernons.  But 
<hi>you</hi> are fitted for Society, &amp; it is shameful to have you exiled 
from it.  Leave Frederica, therefore, to punish herself for the plague she has 
given you, by indulging that romantic tender-heartedness which will always 
ensure her misery enough, &amp; come yourself to Town as soon as you can.
</p>
            <p>I have another reason for urging this:
</p>
            <p>Manwaring came to town last week, &amp; has contrived, in spite of 
Mr. Johnson, to make opportunities of seeing me.  He is absolutely 
miserable about you, &amp; jealous to such a degree of De Courcy, that it would 
be highly unadvisable for them to meet at present.  And yet, if you do not 
allow him to see you here, I cannot answer for his not committing same great 
imprudence — such as going to Churchill, for instance, which would be 
dreadful!  Besides, if you take my advice, &amp; resolve to marry De Courcy, it 
will be indispensably necessary to you to get Manwaring out of the way; &amp; 
you only can have influence enough to send him back to his wife.  I have still 
another motive for your coming: Mr. Johnson leaves London next Tuesday; he 
is going for his health to Bath, where, if the waters are favourable to his 
constitution &amp; my wishes, he will be laid up with the gout many weeks. 
During his absence we shall be able to choose our own society, &amp; to have 
true enjoyment.  I would ask you to Edward Street, but that he once forced from 
me a kind of promise never to invite you to my house; nothing but my being in 
the utmost distress for Money should have extorted it from me.  I can get you, 
however, a nice Drawing-room-apartment in Upper Seymour St, &amp; we may be 
always together there or here; for I consider my promise to Mr. Johnson as 
comprehending only (at least in his absence) your not sleeping in the 
House.
</p>
            <p>Poor Manwaring gives me such histories of his wife's jealousy.  Silly Woman, 
to expect constancy from so charming a Man! but she always was silly — 
intolerably so in marrying him at all.  She the Heiress of a large Fortune, he 
without a shilling!  <hi>One</hi> title, I know, she might have had, besides 
Baronets.  Her folly in forming the connection was so great that tho' 
Mr. Johnson was her Guardian, &amp; I do not in general share his feelings, 
I never can forgive her.

            <p>                             Adieu, Yours, ALICIA.</p>

            </q>
            <p>This letter, my dear Mother, will be brought you by Reginald.  His long 
visit is about to be concluded at last, but I fear the separation takes place 
too late to do us any good.  <hi>She</hi> is going to London to see her 
particular friend, Mrs. Johnson.  It was at first her intention that 
Frederica should accompany her, for the benefit of Masters, but we over-ruled 
her there.  Frederica was wretched in the idea of going, &amp; I could not bear 
to have her at the mercy of her Mother; not all the Masters in London could 
compensate for the ruin of her comfort.  I should have feared, too, for her 
health, &amp; for everything but her Principles — <hi>there</hi> I beleive she 
is not to be injured by her Mother, or all her Mother's friends; but with those 
friends (a very bad set, I doubt not) she must have mixed, or have been left in 
total solitude, &amp; I can hardly tell which would have been worse for her. 
If she is with her Mother, moreover, she must, alas! in all probability be with 
Reginald — &amp; that would be the greatest evil of all.
</p>
            <p>Here we shall in time be in peace.  Our regular employments, our Books &amp; 
conversation, with Exercise, the Children, &amp; every domestic pleasure in my 
power to procure her, will, I trust, gradually overcome this youthful 
attachment.  I should not have a doubt of it, were she slighted for any other 
woman in the world than her own Mother.
</p>
            <p>How long Lady Susan will be in Town, or whether she returns here again, I 
know not.  I could not be cordial in my invitation; but if she chuses to 
come, no want of cordiality on my part will keep her away.
</p>
            <p>I could not help asking Reginald if he intended being in Town this winter, 
as soon as I found her Ladyship's steps would be bent thither; &amp; tho' he 
professed himself quite undetermined, there was something in his look &amp; 
voice as he spoke which contradicted his words.  I have done with Lamentation. 
I look upon the event as so far decided that I resign myself to it in despair. 
If he leaves you soon for London, everything will be concluded.

            <p>My dearest Friend
</p>
            <p>I write in the greatest distress; the most unfortunate event has just taken 
place.  Mr. Johnson has hit on the most effectual manner of plaguing us 
all.  He had heard, I imagine, by some means or other, that you were soon to be 
in London, &amp; immediately contrived to have such an attack of the Gout as 
must at least delay his journey to Bath, if not wholly prevent it.  I am 
persuaded the Gout is brought on or kept off at pleasure; it was the same when 
I wanted to join the Hamiltons to the Lakes; &amp; three years ago, when 
<hi>I</hi> had a fancy for Bath, nothing could induce him to have a Gouty 
symptom.
</p>
            <p>I have received yours, &amp; have engaged the Lodgings in consequence.  I am 
pleased to find that my Letter had so much effect on you, &amp; that De Courcy 
is certainly your own.  Let me hear from you as soon as you arrive, &amp; in 
particular tell me what you mean to do with Manwaring.  It is impossible to say 
when I shall be able to see you; my confinement must be great.  It is such an 
abominable trick to be ill here instead of at Bath that I can scarcely command 
myself at all.  At Bath, his old Aunts would have nursed him, but here it all 
falls upon me — &amp; he bears pain with such patience that I have not the 
common excuse for losing my temper.

            <p>My dear Alicia
</p>
            <p>There needed not this last fit of the Gout to make me detest 
Mr. Johnson, but now the extent of my aversion is not to be estimated.  To 
have you confined as Nurse in his apartment!  My dear Alicia, of what a mistake 
were you guilty in marrying a Man of his age! — just old enough to be formal, 
ungovernable, &amp; to have the Gout; too old to be agreable, too young to 
die.
</p>
            <p>I arrived last night about five, &amp; had scarcely swallowed my dinner when 
Manwaring made his appearance.  I will not dissemble what real pleasure his 
sight afforded me, nor how strongly I felt the contrast between his person 
&amp; manners &amp; those of Reginald, to the infinite disadvantage of the 
latter.  For an hour or two I was even staggered in my resolution of marrying 
him, &amp; tho' this was too idle &amp; nonsensical an idea to remain long on 
my mind, I do not feel very eager for the conclusion of my Marriage, nor look 
forward with much impatience to the time when Reginald, according to our 
agreement, is to be in Town.  I shall probably put off his arrival under some 
pretence or other.  He must not come till Manwaring is gone.
</p>
            <p>I am still doubtful at times as to Marriage.  If the old Man would die, I 
might not hesitate; but a state of dependence on the caprice of Sir Reginald 
will not suit the freedom of my spirit; &amp; if I resolve to wait for that 
event, I shall have excuse enough at present, in having been scarcely ten 
months a Widow.
</p>
            <p>I have not given Manwaring any hint of my intention, or allowed him to 
consider my acquaintance with Reginald as more than the commonest flirtation, 
&amp; he is tolerably appeased.  Adieu, till we meet; I am enchanted with my 
Lodgings.

            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lady Susan Vernon to Mr. De Courcy</hi>
               </l>
               <l/>
               <l>                                   Upper Seymour St. </l>
            </q>
            <p>I have received your Letter, &amp; tho' I do not attempt to conceal that I 
am gratified by your impatience for the hour of meeting, I yet feel myself 
under the necessity of delaying that hour beyond the time originally fixed. 
Do not think me unkind for such an exercise of my power, nor accuse me of 
Instability without first hearing my reasons.  In the course of my journey 
from Churchill, I had ample leisure for reflection on the present state of our 
affairs, &amp; every review has served to convince me that they require a 
delicacy &amp; cautiousness of conduct to which we have hitherto been too 
little attentive.  We have been hurried on by our feelings to a degree of 
Precipitation which ill accords with the claims of our Friends or the opinion 
of the World.  We have been unguarded in forming this hasty Engagement, but we 
must not complete the imprudence by ratifying it while there is so much reason 
to fear the Connection would be opposed by those Friends on whom you 
depend.
</p>
            <p>It is not for us to blame any expectations on your Father's side of your 
marrying to advantage; where possessions are so extensive as those of your 
Family, the wish of increasing them, if not strictly reasonable, is too common 
to excite surprise or resentment.  He has a right to require a woman of 
fortune in his daughter in law, &amp; I am sometimes quarrelling with myself 
for suffering you to form a connection so imprudent; but the influence of 
reason is often acknowledged too late by those who feel like me.
</p>
            <p>I have now been but a few months a widow; and, however little indebted to my 
Husband's memory for any happiness derived from him during a Union of some 
years, I cannot forget that the indelicacy of so early a second marriage must 
subject me to the censure of the World, &amp; incur, what would be still more 
insupportable, the displeasure of Mr. Vernon.  I might perhaps harden 
myself in time against the injustice of general reproach, but the loss of 
<hi>his</hi> valued Esteem I am, as you well know, ill-fitted to endure; &amp; 
when to this may be added the consciousness of having injured you with your 
Family, how am I to support myself?  With feelings so poignant as mine, the 
conviction of having divided the son from his Parents would make me, even with 
<hi>you</hi>, the most miserable of Beings.
</p>
            <p>It will surely, therefore, be advisable to delay our Union, to delay it till 
appearances are more promising, till affairs have taken a more favourable turn. 
To assist us in such a resolution, I feel that absence will be necessary.  We 
must not meet.  Cruel as this sentence may appear, the necessity of pronouncing 
it, which can alone reconcile it to myself, will be evident to you when you 
have considered our situation in the light in which I have found myself 
imperiously obliged to place it.  You may be — you must be — well assured 
that nothing but the strongest conviction of Duty could induce me to wound my 
own feelings by urging a lengthened separation, &amp; of insensibility to yours 
you will hardly suspect me.  Again, therefore, I say that we ought not, we must 
not yet meet.  By a removal for some Months from each other, we shall 
tranquillize the sisterly fears of Mrs. Vernon, who, accustomed herself to 
the enjoyment of riches, considers Fortune as necessary everywhere, &amp; whose 
Sensibilities are not of a nature to 
comprehend ours.
</p>
            <p>Let me hear from you soon — very soon.  Tell me that you submit to my 
Arguments, &amp; do not reproach me for using such.  I cannot bear reproaches: 
my spirits are not so high as to need being repressed.  I must endeavour to 
seek amusement abroad, &amp; fortunately many of my Friends are in town; 
among them the Manwarings; you know how sincerely I regard both Husband &amp; 
wife.
</p>
            <p>                   I am ever, Faithfully Yours

            <p>My dear Friend,
</p>
            <p>That tormenting creature Reginald is here.  My Letter, which was intended 
to keep him longer in the Country, has hastened him to Town.  Much as I wish 
him away, however, I cannot help being pleased with such a proof of 
attachment.  He is devoted to me, heart &amp; soul.  He will carry this note 
himself, which is to serve as an Introduction to you, with whom he longs to be 
acquainted.  Allow him to spend the Evening with you, that I may be in no 
danger of his returning here.  I have told him that I am not quite well, &amp; 
must be alone; &amp; should he call again there might be confusion, for it is 
impossible to be sure of servants.  Keep him, therefore, I entreat you, in 
Edward St.  You will not find him a heavy companion, &amp; I allow you to 
flirt with him as much as you like.  At the same time do not forget my real 
interest; say all that you can to convince him that I shall be quite wretched 
if he remains here; you know my reasons — Propriety, &amp; so forth.  I would 
urge them more myself, but that I am impatient to be rid of him, as Manwaring 
comes within half an hour.  Adieu,

            <p>My dear Creature,
</p>
            <p>I am in agonies, &amp; know not what to do, nor what <hi>you</hi> can do. 
Mr. De Courcy arrived just when he should not.  Mrs. Manwaring had that 
instant entered the House, &amp; forced herself into her Guardian's presence, 
tho' I did not know a syllable of it till afterwards, for I was out when both 
she &amp; Reginald came, or I should have sent him away at all events; but 
<hi>she</hi> was shut up with Mr. Johnson, while <hi>he</hi> waited in the 
Drawing room for me.  She arrived yesterday in pursuit of her Husband; but 
perhaps you know this already from himself.  She came to this house to entreat 
my Husband's interference, &amp; before I could be aware of it, everything that 
you could wish to be concealed was known to him, &amp; unluckily she had wormed 
out of Manwaring's servant that he had visited you every day since your being 
in Town, &amp; had just watched him to your door herself!  What could I do? 
Facts are such horrid things!  All is by this time known to De Courcy, who is 
now alone with Mr. Johnson.  Do not accuse me; indeed, it was impossible to 
prevent it.  Mr. Johnson has for some time suspected De Courcy of intending 
to marry you, &amp; would speak with him alone as soon as he knew him to be in 
the House.
</p>
            <p>That detestable Mrs. Manwaring, who, for your comfort, has fretted 
herself thinner &amp; uglier than ever, is still here, &amp; they have been all 
closeted together.  What can be done?  At any rate, I hope he will plague his 
wife more than ever.  With anxious wishes,

            <p>This Eclaircissement is rather provoking.  How unlucky that you should have 
been from home!  I thought myself sure of you at 7.  I am undismayed, however. 
Do not torment yourself with fears on my account; depend on it, I can make my 
story good with Reginald.  Manwaring is just gone; he brought me the news of 
his wife's arrival.  Silly woman, what does she expect by such Manoeuvres?  Yet 
I wish she had staid quietly at Langford.
</p>
            <p>Reginald will be a little enraged at first, but by To-morrow's Dinner 
everything will be well again.

            <p>I write only to bid you Farewell.  The spell is removed; I see you as you 
are.  Since we parted yesterday, I have received from indisputable authority 
such an history of you as must bring the most mortifying conviction of the 
Imposition I have been under, &amp; the absolute necessity of an immediate 
&amp; eternal separation from you.  You cannot doubt to what I allude. 
Langford — Langford — that word will be sufficient.  I received my 
information in Mr. Johnson's house, from Mrs. Manwaring herself.
</p>
            <p>You know how I have loved you; you can intimately judge of my present 
feelings; but I am not so weak as to find indulgence in describing them to a 
woman who will glory in having excited their anguish, but whose affection they

so extraordinary a change in your sentiments.  Have I not explained everything 
to you with respect to myself which could bear a doubtful meaning, &amp; which 
the ill-nature of the World had interpreted to my Discredit?  What can you 
<hi>now</hi> have heard to stagger your Esteem for me?  Have I ever had a 
concealment from you?  Reginald, you agitate me beyond expression.  I cannot 
suppose that the old story of Mrs. Manwaring's jealousy can be revived 
again, or at least be <hi>listened</hi> to again.  Come to me immediately, 
&amp; explain what is at present absolutely incomprehensible.  Beleive me, the 
single word of <hi>Langford</hi> is not of such potent intelligence as to 
supersede the necessity of more.  If we <hi>are</hi> to part, it will at least 
be handsome to take your personal Leave.  But I have little heart to jest; in 
truth, I am serious enough — for to be sunk, tho' but for an hour, in your 
esteem is an humiliation to which I know not how to submit.  I shall count 
every minute till your arrival.

            <p>Why would you write to me?  Why do you require particulars?  But since it

during the life &amp; since the death of Mr. Vernon, which had reached me, 
in common with the World in general, &amp; gained my entire belief before I saw 
you, but which you, by the exertion of your perverted Abilities, had made me 
resolve to disallow, have been unanswerably proved to me.  Nay, more, I am 
assured that a connection of which I had never before entertained a thought, 
has for some time existed, &amp; still continues to exist, between you &amp; 
the Man whose family you robbed of its Peace, in return for the hospitality 
with which you were received into it!  That you have corresponded with him ever 
since your leaving Langford — not with his wife — but with him — &amp; that 
he now visits you every day.  Can you, dare you deny it? &amp; all this at the 
time when I was an encouraged, an accepted Lover!  From what have I not 
escaped!  I have only to be grateful.  Far from me be all complaint, &amp; 
every sigh of regret.  My own Folly had endangered me, my Preservation I owe to 
the kindness, the Integrity of another.  But the unfortunate 
Mrs. Manwaring, whose agonies while she related the past seemed to threaten 
her reason — how is <hi>she</hi> to be consoled?
</p>
            <p>After such a discovery as this, you will scarcely affect further wonder at 
my meaning in bidding you Adieu.  My Understanding is at length restored, &amp; 
teaches me no less to abhor the Artifices which had subdued me than to despise 
myself for the weakness on which their strength was founded.

I were you, I would certainly get him myself.  I had almost forgot to give you 
my opinion of Mr. De Courcy, I am really delighted with him; he is full as 
handsome, I think, as Manwaring, &amp; with such an open, good-humoured 
countenance that one cannot help loving him at first sight.  Mr. Johnson

            <p>I yeild to the necessity which parts us.  Under circumstances you could not 
act otherwise.  Our friendship cannot be impaired by it, &amp; in happier 
times, when your situation is as independent as mine, it will unite us again in 
the same Intimacy as ever.  For this I shall impatiently wait; &amp; meanwhile 
can safely assure you that I never was more at ease, or better satisfied with 
myself &amp; everything about me than at the present hour.  Your Husband I 
abhor — Reginald I despise — &amp; I am secure of never seeing either again. 
Have I not reason to rejoice?  Manwaring is more devoted to me than ever; &amp; 
were he at liberty, I doubt if I could resist even Matrimony offered by 
<hi>him</hi>.  This event, if his wife live with you, it may be in your power 
to hasten.  The violence of her feelings, which must wear her out, may be 
easily kept in irritation.  I rely on your friendship for this.  I am now 
satisfied that I never could have brought myself to marry Reginald; &amp; am 
equally determined that Frederica never <hi>shall</hi>.  To-morrow I shall 
fetch her from Churchill, &amp; let Maria Manwaring tremble for the 
consequence.  Frederica shall be Sir James's wife before she quits my house. 
<hi>She</hi> may whimper, &amp; the Vernons may storm; I regard them not.  I am 
tired of submitting my will to the Caprices of others; of resigning my own 
Judgement in deference to those to whom I owe no Duty, &amp; for whom I feel no 
respect.  I have given up too much, have been too easily worked on; but 
Frederica shall now find the difference.
</p>
            <p>Adieu, dearest of Friends.  May the next Gouty Attack be more favourable! 
And may you always regard me as unalterably yours

            <p>My dear Catherine
</p>
            <p>I have charming news for you, &amp; if I had not sent off my Letter this 
morning, you might have been spared the vexation of knowing of Reginald's being 
gone to Town, for he is returned, Reginald is 
returned, not to ask our consent to his marrying Lady Susan, but to tell us 
they are parted forever!  He has been only an hour in the House, &amp; I have 
not been able to learn particulars, for he is so very low that I have not the 
heart to ask questions; but I hope we shall soon know all.  This is the most 
joyful hour he has ever given us since the day of his birth.  Nothing is 
wanting but to have you here, &amp; it is our particular wish &amp; entreaty 
that you would come to us as soon as you can.  You have owed us a visit many 
long weeks.  I hope nothing will make it inconvenient to Mr. Vernon, &amp; 
pray bring all my Grand-Children; &amp; your dear Neice is included, of course; 
I long to see her.  It has been a sad, heavy winter hitherto, without Reginald, 
&amp; seeing nobody from Churchill.  I never found the season so dreary before; 
but this happy meeting will make us young again.  Frederica runs much in my 
thoughts, &amp; when Reginald has recovered his usual good spirits (as I trust 
he soon will), we will try to rob him of his heart once more, &amp; I am full 
of hopes of seeing their hands joined at no great distance.

            <p>My dear Madam
</p>
            <p>Your Letter has surprised me beyond measure!  Can it be true that they are 
really separated — &amp; forever?  I should be overjoyed if I dared depend on 
it, but after all that I have seen, how can one be secure?  And Reginald really 
with you!  My surprise is the greater because on Wednesday, the very day of 
his coming to Parklands, we had a most unexpected &amp; unwelcome visit from 
Lady Susan, looking all chearfulness &amp; good-humour, &amp; seeming more as 
if she were to marry him when she got to London, than as if parted from him 
forever.  She staid nearly two hours, was as affectionate &amp; agreable as 
ever, &amp; not a syllable, not a hint, was dropped of any disagreement or 
coolness between them.  I asked her whether she had seen my Brother since his 
arrival in Town — not, as you may suppose, with any doubt of the fact, but 
merely to see how she looked.  She immediately answered, without any 
embarrassment, that he had been kind enough to call on her on Monday, but she 
beleived he had already returned home — which I was very far from crediting.
</p>
            <p>Your kind invitation is accepted by us with pleasure, &amp; on Thursday next 
we &amp; our little ones will be with you.  Pray Heaven, Reginald may not be 
in Town again by that time!
</p>
            <p>I wish we could bring dear Frederica too, but I am sorry to say that her 
Mother's errand hither was to fetch her away; and, miserable as it made the 
poor Girl, it was impossible to detain her.  I was thoroughly unwilling to let 
her go, &amp; so was her Uncle; &amp; all that could be urged we <hi>did</hi> urge; but 
Lady Susan declared that as she was now about to fix herself in Town for 
several Months, she could not be easy if her Daughter were not with her, for 
Masters, &amp;c.  Her Manner, to be sure, was very kind &amp; proper, &amp; 
Mr. Vernon beleives that Frederica will now be treated with affection.  I 
wish I could think so too!
</p>
            <p>The poor girl's heart was almost broke at taking leave of us.  I charged her 
to write to me very often, &amp; to remember that if she were in any distress 
we should be always her friends.  I took care to see her alone, that I might 
say all this, &amp; I hope made her a little more comfortable.  But I shall not 
be easy till I can go to Town &amp; judge of 
her situation myself.
</p>
            <p>I wish there were a better prospect than now appears of the Match which the 
conclusion of your Letter declares your expectation of.  At present it is not 
very likely.

            <head>CONCLUSION</head>
            <p>This Correspondence, by a meeting between some of the parties, &amp; a 
separation between the others, could not, to the great detriment of the Post 
office Revenue, be continued longer.  Very little assistance to the State 
could be derived from the Epistolary Intercourse of Mrs. Vernon &amp; her 
neice; for the former soon perceived, by the style of Frederica's letters, 
that they were written under her Mother's inspection, &amp; therefore 
deferring all particular inquiry till she could make it personally in Town, 
ceased writing minutely or often.
</p>
            <p>Having learnt enough in the meanwhile from her open-hearted Brother, of 
what had passed between him &amp; Lady Susan to sink the latter lower than 
ever in her opinion, she was proportionably more anxious to get Frederica 
removed from such a Mother, &amp; placed under her own care; and, tho' with 
little hope of success, was resolved to leave nothing unattempted that might 
offer a chance of obtaining her Sister-in-law's consent to it.  Her anxiety on 
the subject made her press for an early visit to London; &amp; Mr. Vernon, 
who, as it must already have appeared, lived only to do whatever he was 
desired, soon found some accommodating Business to call him thither.  With a 
heart full of the Matter, Mrs. Vernon waited on Lady Susan shortly after her 
arrival in Town, &amp; was met with such an easy &amp; chearful affection, as 
made her almost turn from her with horror.  No remembrance of Reginald, no 
consciousness of Guilt, gave one look of embarrassment.  She was in excellent 
spirits, &amp; seemed eager to shew at once, by every possible attention to her 
Brother &amp; Sister, her sense of their kindness, &amp; her pleasure in their 
society.
</p>
            <p>Frederica was no more altered than Lady Susan; the same restrained Manners, 
the same timid Look in the presence of her Mother as heretofore, assured her 
Aunt of her situation's being uncomfortable, &amp; confirmed her in the plan of 
altering it.  No unkindness, however, on the part of Lady Susan appeared. 
Persecution on the subject of Sir James was entirely at an end — his name 
merely mentioned to say that he was not in London; &amp; indeed, in all her 
conversation she was solicitous only for the welfare &amp; improvement of her 
Daughter, acknowledging, in terms of grateful delight, that Frederica was now 
growing every day more &amp; more what a Parent could desire.
</p>
            <p>Mrs. Vernon, surprised &amp; incredulous, knew not what to suspect, and, 
without any change in her own views, only feared greater difficulty in 
accomplishing them.  The first hope of anything better was derived from Lady 
Susan's asking her whether she thought Frederica looked quite as well as she 
had done at Churchill, as she must confess herself to have sometimes an 
anxious doubt of London's perfectly agreeing with her.
</p>
            <p>Mrs. Vernon, encouraging the doubt, directly proposed her Neice's returning 
with them into the country.  Lady Susan was unable to express her sense of 
such kindness, yet knew not, from a variety of reasons, how to part with her 
Daughter; &amp; as, tho' her own plans were not yet wholly fixed, she trusted 
it would ere long be in her power to take Frederica into the country herself, 
concluded by declining entirely to profit by such unexampled attention. 
Mrs. Vernon, however, persevered in the offer of it; &amp; tho' Lady Susan 
continued to resist, her resistance in the course of a few days seemed 
somewhat less formidable.
</p>
            <p>The lucky alarm of an Influenza decided what might not have been decided 
quite so soon.  Lady Susan's maternal fears were then too much awakened for 
her to think of anything but Frederica's removal from the risk of infection. 
Above all Disorders in the World, she most dreaded the influenza for her 
Daughter's constitution!  Frederica returned to Churchill with her uncle &amp; 
aunt; &amp; three weeks afterwards, Lady Susan announced her being married to 
Sir James Martin.
</p>
            <p>Mrs. Vernon was then convinced of what she had only suspected before, that 
she might have spared herself all the trouble of urging a removal which Lady 
Susan had doubtless resolved on from the first.  Frederica's visit was 
nominally for six weeks; but her Mother, tho' inviting her to return in one or 
two affectionate Letters, was very ready to oblige the whole Party by 
consenting to a prolongation of her stay, &amp; in the course of two months 
ceased to write of her absence, &amp; in the course of two more to write to 
her at all.
</p>
            <p>Frederica was therefore fixed in the family of her Uncle &amp; Aunt till 
such time as Reginald De Courcy could be talked, flattered, &amp; finessed 
into an affection for her — which, allowing leisure for the conquest of his 
attachment to her Mother, for his abjuring all future attachments, &amp; 
detesting the Sex, might be reasonably looked for in the course of a 
Twelvemonth.  Three Months might have done it in general, but Reginald's 
feelings were no less lasting than lively.
</p>
            <p>Whether Lady Susan was or was not happy in her second Choice — I do not 
see how it can ever be ascertained — for who would take her assurance of it 
on either side of the question?  The World must judge from Probability; she 
had nothing against her but her Husband &amp; her Conscience.
</p>
            <p>Sir James may seem to have drawn a harder lot than mere Folly merited.  I 
leave him, therefore, to all the Pity that anybody can give him.  For myself, 
I confess that <hi>I</hi> can pity only Miss Manwaring, who, coming to Town &amp; 
putting herself to an expense in Cloathes which impoverished her for two 
years, on purpose to secure him, was defrauded of her due by a Woman ten years 
older than herself.</p>
