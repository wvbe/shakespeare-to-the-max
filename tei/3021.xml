            <p>IT is not any pri<g ref="#rehy"/>vate respect of gain, Gentle <hi>Reader</hi>,
for the slightest Pamphlet is now adayes more vendible then the Works of
learnedest men; but it  is the love I have to our own Language that hath
made me diligent to collect, and set forth
<pb/> such Peeces both in Prose and Vers, as may renew the wonted honour
and esteem of our English tongue: and it's the worth of these both
English and Latin <hi>Poems</hi>, not the flourish of any prefixed
<hi>encomions</hi> that can invite thee  to buy them, though these are
not without the highest Commendati<g ref="#rehy"/>ons and Applause of the
learnedst
<hi>Academicks</hi>, both domestick and forrein: And amongst those of
our own Countrey, the unpa<g ref="#rehy"/>rallel'd attestation of that renown<g ref="#rehy"/>ed
Provost of <hi>Eaton</hi>, Sir
<hi>Henry Wooton</hi>: I know not thy palat how it relishes such
dainties, nor how harmonious thy
<pb/>
               <milestone n="a4" unit="sig"/> soul is; perhaps more trivial Airs
may please thee better. But howsoever thy opinion is spent upon these,
that incouragement I have already received from the most in<g ref="#rehy"/>genious
men in their clear and courteous entertainment of Mr.
<hi>Wallers</hi> late choice Peeces, hath once more made me adven<g ref="#rehy"/>ture
into the World, presenting it with these ever-green and not to be
blasted Laurels. The Authors more peculiar excellency in these studies,
was too well known to con<g ref="#rehy"/>ceal his Papers, or to keep me from
attempting to sollicit them from him. Let the event guide it self which
way it will, I shall de<g ref="#rehy"/>serve 
<pb/> of the age, by bringing into the Light as true a Birth, as the
Muses have brought forth since our famous <hi>Spencer</hi> wrote; whose
Poems in these English ones are as rarely imitated, as sweetly excell'd.
Reader if thou art Eagle-eied to censure their worth, I am not fearful
to expose them to thy exactest perusal.</p>

                     <l>'Twas such a shifter, that if truth were known, </l>
                     <l>Death was half glad when he had got him down; </l>
                     <l>For he had any time this ten yeers full, </l>

                     <l>But lately finding him so long at home, </l>

                     <l>Rest that gives all men life, gave him his death, </l>

                  <head>The Copy of a Letter Writt'n By <name rend="none">Sir HENRY  WOOTTON</name>,
To the Author, upon the following Poem.</head>
                  <head rend="italic">From the Colledge, this 13. of April,  1638.</head>
                  <salute rend="italic">SIR,</salute>
                  <p>IT was a special favour, when you lately bestowed upon me 
here, the first taste of your acquaintance, though no longer then  to
make me know that I wanted more time to value it, and to enjoy  it
rightly; and in truth, if I could then have imagined your  farther stay
in these parts, which I understood afterwards by Mr. 
<hi>H</hi>., I would have been bold in our vulgar phrase to mend my 
draught (for you left me with an extreme thirst) and to have  begged
your conver<g ref="#rehy"/>sation again, joyntly with your said  learned Friend,
at a poor meal or two, that we might have banded  together som good
Authors of the antient time: Among which, I  observed you to have been
familiar.</p>
                  <p>Since your going, you have charg'd me with new Obligations,  both
for a very kinde Letter from you dated the sixth of this  Month, and for
a dainty peece of entertainment which came  therwith. Wherin I should
much commend the Tragical part, if the  Lyrical did not ravish me with a
certain Dorique delicacy in your  Songs and Odes, wherunto I must 
<pb n="72"/> plainly confess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our
Language: 
<foreign xml:lang="la">Ipsa mollities</foreign>. But I must not omit to 
tell you, that I now onely owe your thanks for intimating unto me  (how
modestly soever) the true Artificer. For the work it self, I  had view'd
som good while before, with singular delight,  ha<g ref="#rehy"/>ving receiv'd it
from our common Friend Mr. <hi>R.</hi> in the  verse close of the late
<hi>R</hi>'s Poems, Printed at <hi>Oxford</hi>,  wherunto it was added
(as I now sup<g ref="#rehy"/>pose) that the Accessory  might help out the Princi<g ref="#rehy"/>pal,
according to the art of 
<hi>Stationers</hi>, and to leave the Reader <foreign xml:lang="it"> Con
la  bocca dolce.</foreign>.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, concerning your travels, wherin I may chalenge a  little
more priviledge of Discours with you; I suppose you will  not blanch
<hi>Paris</hi> in your way; therfore I have been bold to  trouble you
with a few lines to Mr. <hi>M.B.</hi> whom you shall easily  find
attending the your Lord <hi>S.</hi> as his Gover<g ref="#rehy"/>nour, and you 
may surely receive from his good directions for the shaping of  your
farther journey into <hi>Italy</hi>, where he did reside by my  choice
som time for the King, after mine own recess from 
<hi>Venice</hi>.</p>
                  <p>I should thing that your best Line will be thorow the whole  length
of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Marseilles</hi>, and thence by Sea to <hi>Genoa</hi>,
 whence the passage into <hi>Tuscany</hi> is as Diurnal as a <hi>Gravesend</hi>
 Barge: I hasten as you do to <hi>Florence</hi>, or <hi>Siena</hi>,
the rather  to tell you a short story from the interest you have given
me in  your safety.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Siena</hi> I was tabled in the House of one <hi>Al<g ref="#rehy"/>berto
 Scipioni</hi> an old <hi>Roman</hi> Courtier in dangerous <pb n="73"/>
times, having bin Steward to the <hi>Duca di Pagliono</hi>,  who with
all his Family were strangled, save this onely man that  escap'd by
foresight of the Tempest: With him I had often much  chat of those
affairs; Into which he took pleasure to look back  from his Native
Harbour; and at my departure toward <hi>Rome</hi> (which  had been the
center of his experience) I had wonn confidence  enough to beg his
advice, how I might carry my self securely  there, without offence of
others, or of mine own conscience.
