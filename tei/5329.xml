            <head>TO Lord <hi>CLARE.</hi>
            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>THANKS, my Lord, for your Ven'ſon; for finer, or fatter,</l>
               <l>Never rang'd in a foreſt, or ſmok'd on a platter:</l>
               <l>The Haunch was a picture for Painters to ſtudy;</l>
               <l>The white was ſo white, and the red was ſo ruddy!</l>
               <l>I had thoughts, in my chamber to hang it in view,</l>
               <l>To be ſhown to my Friends as a piece of <hi>Virtù;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>As in ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Houſes, where things are ſo-ſo,</l>
               <l>One Gammon of Bacon hangs up for a ſhow;</l>
               <l>But, for eating a raſher of what they take pride in,</l>
               <l>They'd as ſoon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in.</l>
               <l>But hold—let us pauſe—Don't I hear you pronounce</l>
               <l>This tale of the Bacon a damnable bounce?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0657000400:6"/>
Well, ſuppoſe it a bounce; ſure a Poet may try,</l>
               <l>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly:</l>
               <l>But, my Lord, it's no bounce: I proteſt, in my turn,</l>
               <l>It's a truth; and your Lordſhip may aſk Mr. BURNE.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To go on with my tale—As I gaz'd on the Haunch,</l>
               <l>thought of a Friend that was truſty and ſtaunch:</l>
               <l>So I cut it, and ſent it to REYNOLDS undreſt,</l>
               <l>To paint it, or eat it, juſt as he lik'd beſt.</l>
               <l>Of the Neck and the Breaſt I had next to diſpoſe;</l>
               <l>'Twas a neck and a breaſt—that might rival MONROE's:</l>
               <l>But in parting with theſe I was puzzled again,</l>
               <l>With the <hi>how,</hi> and the <hi>who,</hi> and the <hi>where,</hi> and the <hi>when:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>There's COLEY, and WILLIAMS, and HOWARD, and HIFF—</l>
               <l>I think they love Ven'ſon; I know they love Beef:</l>
               <l>But—hang it!—to Poets, that ſeldom can eat,</l>
               <l>Your very good Mutton's a very good treat:</l>
               <l>Such dainties to them! It <hi>would</hi> look like a flirt,</l>
               <l>Like ſending 'em Ruffles when wanting a Shirt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While thus I debated, in <hi>reverie</hi> center'd,</l>
               <l>An Acquaintance, a Friend—as he call'd himſelf, enter'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0657000400:7"/>
A fine-ſpoken Cuſtom-houſe Officer he,</l>
               <l>Who ſmil'd as he gaz'd on the Ven'ſon and me.</l>
               <l>" What have we got here?—Aye, this is <hi>good eating!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" Your own, I ſuppoſe—or is it in waiting?"</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Why, whoſe ſhould it be, Sir?</hi> cry'd I, with a flounce;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I get theſe things often—</hi>But that was a bounce.</l>
               <l>" If that be the caſe then," cry'd he very gay,</l>
               <l>" I'm glad I have taken this houſe in my way.</l>
               <l>" To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me:</l>
               <l>" No words—I inſiſt on't—preciſely at three.</l>
               <l>" And now that I think on't, as I am a ſinner,</l>
               <l>" We wanted this Ven'ſon to make up the dinner.</l>
               <l>" I'll take no denial—you ſhall, and you muſt;</l>
               <l>" And my Wife, little <hi>Kitty,</hi> is famous for Cruſt.</l>
               <l>" We'll have JOHNSON and BURKE; all the Wits will be there;</l>
               <l>" My acquaintance is ſlight, or I'd aſk my Lord CLARE.</l>
               <l>" Here, Porter! this Ven'ſon with me to <hi>Mile-end—</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" No words, my dear GOLDSMITH! my very good Friend!"</l>
               <l>Thus, ſeizing his hat, he bruſh'd off like the wind,</l>
               <l>And the Porter and Eatables follow'd behind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0657000400:8"/>
               <l>Left alone to reflect, having empty'd my ſhelf,</l>
               <l>And nobody with me at ſea, but myſelf;</l>
               <l>Though I could not help thinking my Gentleman haſty,</l>
               <l>Yet JOHNSON and BURKE, and a good Ven'ſon Paſty,</l>
               <l>Were things that I never diſlik'd in my life,</l>
               <l>Though clogg'd with a Coxcomb, and <hi>Kitty</hi> his Wife.</l>
               <l>So next day, in due ſplendor to make my approach,</l>
               <l>I drove to his door in my own Hackney-coach.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When come to the place where we all were to dine,</l>
               <l>(A chair-lumber'd Cloſet, juſt twelve feet by nine)</l>
               <l>My Friend bid me welcome, but ſtruck me quite dumb</l>
               <l>With tidings <hi>that</hi> JOHNSON and BURKE could not come:</l>
               <l>" And I knew it," he cry'd; "both eternally fail;</l>
               <l>" The one at the Houſe, and the other with THRALE.</l>
               <l>" But, I warrant for me, we ſhall make up the Party,</l>
               <l>" With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.</l>
               <l>" The one is a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> the other a <hi>Jew,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" Who dabble and write in the Papers—like you:</l>
               <l>" The one writes the <hi>Snarler;</hi> the other, the <hi>Scourge:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>" Some think he writes <hi>Cinna—</hi>he owns to <hi>Panurge.</hi>"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0657000400:9"/>
               <l>While thus he deſcrib'd them by Trade and by Name,</l>
               <l>They enter'd; and Dinner was ſerv'd as they came:</l>
               <l>At the top a fry'd Liver and Bacon was ſeen;</l>
               <l>At the bottom was Tripe in a ſwinging terrene;</l>
               <l>At the ſides there was Spinage and Pudding made hot;</l>
               <l>In the middle—a place, where the Ven'ſon was not.</l>
               <l>Now, my Lord, as for Tripe, it's my utter averſion;</l>
               <l>And your Bacon I hate, like a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Perſian:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But what vex'd me moſt was that damn'd <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Rogue,</l>
               <l>With his long-winded ſpeeches, and ſmiles, and his brogue:</l>
               <l>" And, Madam," ſays he, "may this bit be my poiſon</l>
               <l>" If a prettier Dinner I ever ſet eyes on!</l>
               <l>" Pray, a ſlice of your Liver;—but may I be curſt,</l>
               <l>" But I've eat of your Tripe till I'm ready to burſt."</l>
               <l>'Your Tripe!' quoth the <hi>Jew,</hi> 'if the truth I may ſpeak,</l>
               <l>'I could eat of this Tripe ſeven days in the week:</l>
               <l>'I like theſe <hi>here</hi> Dinners, ſo pretty and ſmall;</l>
               <l>'But your Friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.'</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0657000400:10"/>
" O ho!" quoth my Friend, "he'll come on in a trice;</l>
               <l>" He's keeping a corner for ſomething that's nice:</l>
               <l>" There's a Paſty."—'A Paſty!' returned the <hi>Scot;</hi>

               <l>'I don't care if I keep a corner for <hi>thot.</hi>'</l>
               <l>" We'll all keep a corner," the Lady cry'd out:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>We'll all keep a corner,</hi> was eccho'd about.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While thus we reſolv'd, and the Paſty delay'd,</l>
               <l>With looks quite aſtoniſhing enter'd the Maid:</l>
               <l>A viſage ſo ſad, and ſo pale with affright!</l>
               <l>Wak'd PRIAM, by drawing his curtains by night.</l>
               <l>But too ſoon we found out (for who could miſtake her?)</l>
               <l>That ſhe came with ſome terrible news from the Baker;</l>
               <l>And ſo it fell out; for that negligent Sloven</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sad <hi>Philomel</hi> thus—but let ſimiles drop;</l>
               <l>And now, that I think on't, the ſtory may ſtop.</l>
               <l>To be plain, my good Lord, 'tis but labour miſplac'd</l>

            <l>Needleſs to him the tribute we beſtow,</l>
