               <l>How innocent sœuer, are made Crimes; </l>
               <l>We shall not shortly dare to tell our dreames, </l>

               <l>Poore, and degenerate from the exalted streine </l>
               <l>Of our great Fathers.  Where is now the soule </l>
               <l>Of God-like Cato?  He, that durst be good, </l>
               <l>When Cæsar durst be euill; and had power, </l>
               <l>As not to liue his slaue, to die his Master. </l>
               <l>Or where the constant Brutus, that (being proofe </l>

               <l>So braue a blowe into the monsters heart </l>
               <l>That sought (vnkindly) to captiue his countrie? </l>
               <l>O they are fled the light.  Those mighty spirits </l>
               <l>Lye rak'd up, with their ashes, in their vrnes, </l>
               <l>And not a sparke of their eternall fire </l>
               <l>Glowes in a present bosome:  All is but blaze, </l>
               <l>Flashes, and smoake, wherewith we labour so, </l>
               <l>There is nothing Romane in us; nothing good, </l>
               <l>Gallant, or great: it is true, that Cordus say's, </l>

               <l>You brought me (the other day) of Silius, </l>
               <l>Adde somewhat to them.  make her vnderstand </l>
               <l>The danger of Sabinus, and the Times, </l>
               <l>Out of his closenesse.  Give Arruntius, wordes </l>
               <l>Of malice against Cæsar; so, to Gallus: </l>
               <l>But (aboue all) to Agrippina.  Say, </l>
               <l>(As you may truely) that her nfinite Pride, </l>
               <l>Propt with the hopes of her too-fruictfull wombe, </l>
               <l>With popular studies gapes for sou'raigntie; </l>
               <l>And threatens Cæsar.  Pray Augusta, then, </l>
               <l>That for her owne, great Cæsars, and the publique </l>
               <l>Safety, she be pleasd to vrge these dangers. </l>
               <l>Cæsar is too secure, (he must be told, </l>
               <l>And best he will take it from a Mothers tongue.) </l>
               <l>Alasse!  What is it for us to sound, to explore, </l>
               <l>To watch, oppose plot practise, or preuent, </l>

               <l>As oft Augustus call'd him a Pompeian: </l>
               <l>Yet this not hurt their friendship.  In his Booke </l>
               <l>He often names Scipio, Afranius, </l>
               <l>Yea the same Cassius, and this Brutus too, </l>
               <l>As worthi'st men; not Theeues, and Parricides, </l>

               <l>As if before the Iudges?  Do but see </l>
               <l>Antonius Letters; Read but Brutus pleadings, </l>
               <l>What vile reproach they hold against Augustus, </l>

               <l>Yet Deified Iulius, and no lesse Augustus, </l>
               <l>Both bore them, and contemn'd them:  (I not know </l>
               <l>Promptly to speake it, whether done with more </l>
               <l>Temper, or wisdome)  “For such Obloquies </l>

               <l>We therefore will take time to think, and answer. </l>
               <l>For Liuia, she can best, herselfe, resolue </l>
               <l>If she will marry after Drusus, or </l>
               <l>Continue in the Famely; besides </l>
               <l>She hath a Mother, and a Grandame yet, </l>
               <l>Whose neerer councels she may guide her by: </l>
               <l>But I will simply deale.  That Enmity, </l>
               <l>Thou fearst in Agrippina, would burne more, </l>
               <l>If Liuias marriage should (as it were in parts) </l>
               <l>Deuide the imperiall house; an Æmulation </l>
               <l>Betweene the women might breake forth; and Discord </l>
               <l>Ruine the Sons, and Nephues, on both hands. </l>
               <l>What if it cause some present difference? </l>
               <l>Thou art not safe, Seianus, if thou proue it. </l>
               <l>Canst thou beleeue, that Liuia, who was wife </l>
               <l>To Caius Cæsar, then to Drusus, now </l>
               <l>Will be contented to grow old with thee, </l>
               <l>Borne but a priuate Gentleman of Rome? </l>
               <l>And raise thee with her losse, if not her shame? </l>
               <l>Or say, that I should wish it, canst thou think </l>
               <l>The Senate, or the People (who have seene </l>
               <l>Her Brother, Father, and our Ancestours, </l>

               <l>The State thou hold'st already, is in talke; </l>

               <l>To be our Eye, and Eare; to keepe strict watch </l>
               <l>On Agrippina, Nero, Drusus; Aye, </l>

               <l>Macro is sharpe, and apprehends:  Besides, </l>
               <l>I know him subtle, close, wise, and well-read </l>
               <l>In Man, and his large Nature; He hath studied </l>

               <l>I will not aske, why Cæsar bids do this: </l>

               <l>We, whom he workes by, are dumbe Instruments, </l>
               <l>To do, but not enquire:  His great intents </l>
               <l>Are to be seru'd, not search'd.  Yet, as that Bow </l>
               <l>Is most in hand, whose owner best doth know </l>
               <l>To affect his aymes, so let that States-man hope </l>
               <l>Most vse, most prise, can hit his Princes scope. </l>
               <l>Nor must he looke at what, or whom to strike, </l>
               <l>But loose at all; Each marke must be alike. </l>
               <l>Were it to plot against the same, the life </l>

               <l>For Friendship, or for Innocence; nay make </l>
               <l>The Gods all guilty; I would vndertake </l>
               <l>This, being imposd me, both with gaine, and ease: </l>
               <l>“The way to rise, is to obey and please, </l>
               <l>He that will thriue in State, he must neglect </l>
               <l>The troden paths, that Truth and Right respect; </l>
               <l>And proue new, wilder wayes:  For Vertue, there, </l>
               <l>Is not that narrow thing, she is elsewhere. </l>
               <l>Mens Fortune there is Vertue; Reason, their Will: </l>
               <l>Their Licence, Law; and their Obseruance, Skill. </l>
               <l>Occasion is their foile; Conscience, their staine; </l>
               <l>Profit, their lustre:  and what else is, vaine.” </l>
               <l>If then it be the Lust of Cæsars power, </l>
               <l>To have raisd Seianus up, and in an houre </l>
               <l>Ore turne him, tumbling, downe, from height of all; </l>
               <l>We are his ready Engine:  And his Fall </l>
               <l>May be our Rise.  “It is no vncouth thing </l>

               <l>In that so labouring posture, by the Souldiers </l>
               <l>That came to succour him.  With which aduenture, </l>

GREETING. 
IF.  YOU.  CONSCRIPT.  FATHERS.  WITH.  YOUR.  CHILDREN.  BE. 
IN. HEALTH. IT. IS. ABOUNDANTLY. WELL. WE. WITH. OUR. 
FRIENDS.  HERE.  ARE.  SO.  The care of the Common-wealth, howsoeuer 
we are remou'd in person, cannot be absent to our thought; 
although, oftentimes, even to Princes most present, the truth of 
their owne affaires is hid:  then which, nothing falls out more miserable 
to a State, or makes the art of gouerning more difficult.  But 
since it hath been our easefull happinesse to enioy both the aydes, 
and industrie of so vigilant a Senate, We professe to have been the 
more indulgent to our pleasures, not as beeing carelesse of our 
office, but rather secure of the necessity.  Neither do these common 
Rumors of many, and infamous Libels published against our 
retirement, at all afflict us; beeing borne more out of mens 
ignorance, then their malice:  and will, neglected, finde their 
owne graue quickly, whereas too sensiblie acknowledg'd, it 
would make their obloquie ours.  Nor do we desire their 
Authors (though found) be censur'd, since in a free State 
(as ours) all men ought to enioy both their mindes, and tongues 
free.

the Maiesty of a Prince, we shall feare to be so vnnaturally 
cruell to our owne fame, as to neglect them.  True it is,  CONSCRIPT

and almost vnknowne Gentry,

remembred, no Innocence is so safe, but it reioyceth to stand in the

made to himselfe, by the Prætorian souldiers, by his Faction in Court

his Popularity, and Dependences, his vrging (and almost driuing) us

which yet we can faintly apprehend the necessity, to doubt.)  If 
CONSCRIPT FATHERS, to your more searching wisdomes, 
there shall appeare farther cause (or of farder proceeding, eyther 
to seyzure of Lands, Goods, or more — ) it is not our power that 
shall limite your authoritie, or our fauour, that must corrupt your 
iustice; either were dishonourable in you, and both vncharitable to 
ourselfe.  We would willingly be present with your Counsailes in this 
businesse, but the daunger of so potent a faction (if it should prooue so) 
forbiddes our attempt:  except one of the Consuls would be intreated 
for our safety to vndertake the guard of us home, then we should 
most readily aduenture.  In the meanetime, it shall not be fit for us 
to importune so iudicious a Senate, who know how much they hurt 
the innocent, that spare the guilty, and how gratefull a sacrifice, to 
the Gods, is the life of an ingratefull person.  We reflect not in this on 
Seianus (notwithstanding if you keepe an eye upon him — And there 
is Latiaris a Senatour, and Pinnarius Natta, two of his most trusted 
Ministers, and so profest, whom we desire not to have appre^nded, but 
as the necessity of the cause exacts it.
