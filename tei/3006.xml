            <head>To the Comic Play-Readers, <ref target="#VENERY">Venery</ref>
and Laughter</head>
            <p>The fashion of play-making I can properly compare to nothing so
naturally as the alteration in apparel: for in the time of the great
<ref target="#CROPDOUB">crop-doublet</ref>, your huge <ref target="#BOMBASTE">bombasted</ref> plays, quilted with mighty words to
lean purposes, was only then in fashion.  And as the <ref target="#DOUBLETF">doublet fell</ref>, neater inventions began to set
up.  Now in the time of spruceness, our plays follow the niceness of
our garments: <ref target="#SINGLEPL">single plots</ref>, <ref target="#QUAINT">quaint</ref> 
               <ref target="#CONCEITS">conceits</ref>,
lecherous jests, dressed up in hanging sleeves, and those are fit for
the times and the <ref target="#TERMERS">termers</ref>.  Such a kind
of light-colour summer stuff, mingled with diverse colours, you shall
find this published comedy, good to keep you in an afternoon from
dice, at home in your chambers; and for venery you shall find enough
for <ref target="#SIXPENCE">sixpence</ref>, but <ref target="#WELLCOUC">well couched</ref> 
               <ref target="#AND">and</ref> you
mark it, for Venus being a woman passes through the play in doublet in
breeches, a brave disguise and a safe one if the <ref target="#STATUTE">statute</ref> untie not her <ref target="#CODPIECE">codpiece point</ref>.  The book I make no question
but is fit for many of your companies, as well as the person itself,
and may be allowed both <ref target="#GALLEYRO">galley room</ref> at
the playhouse, and chamber room at your lodging.  Worse things I must
needs confess the world has taxed her for than has been written of
her; but 'tis the excellency of a writer to leave things better than
he finds 'em; though some obscene fellow (that cares not what he
writes against others, yet keeps a <ref target="#MYSTICAL">mystical</ref> bawdy-house himself, and entertains
drunkards to make use of their pockets and <ref target="#VENTHISP">vent his private bottle-ale at</ref> midnight),
though such a one would have <ref target="#RIPPEDUP">ripped up</ref>
the most nasty vice that ever hell belched forth and presented it to a
modest assembly, yet we rather wish in such discoveries, where
reputation lies bleeding, a slackness of truth than a fullness of
slander.

            <l>A play expected long makes the audience look</l>
            <l>For wonders, that each scene should be a book,</l>
            <l>Compos'd to all perfection; each one comes</l>
            <l>And brings a play in's head with him: up he sums</l>
            <l>What he would of a roaring girl have writ;</l>
            <l>If that he finds not here, he <ref target="#MEWS">mews</ref> at it.</l>
            <l>Only we entreat you think our scene</l>
            <l>Cannot speak high, the subject being but mean:</l>
            <l>A roaring girl whose notes till now never were</l>
            <l>Shall fill with laughter our <ref target="#VASTTHEA">vast theatre</ref>;</l>
            <l>That's all which I dare promise: tragic passion,</l>
            <l>And such grave stuff, is this day out of fashion.</l>
            <l>I see attention sets wide ope her gates</l>
            <l>Of hearing, and with <ref target="#COVETOUS">covetous</ref> list'ning waits,</l>
            <l>To know what girl this roaring girl should be,</l>
            <l>For of that tribe are many.  One is she</l>
            <l>That roars at midnight in deep tavern bowls,</l>
            <l>That beats the watch, and constables controls;</l>
            <l>Another roars i' th' daytime, swears, stabs, <ref target="#GIVESBRA">gives braves</ref>,</l>
            <l>Yet sells her soul to the lust of fools and slaves.</l>
            <l>Both these are <ref target="#SUBURBRO">suburb roarers</ref>.  Then there's <ref target="#BESIDE">beside</ref>
            </l>
            <l>A civil city roaring girl, whose pride,</l>
            <l>Feasting, and riding, shakes her husband's <ref target="#STATE">state</ref>,</l>
            <l>And leaves him roaring through an <ref target="#IRONGRAT">iron grate</ref>.</l>
            <l>None of these roaring girls is ours: she flies</l>
            <l>With wings more lofty.  Thus her character lies;</l>
            <l>Yet what need characters, when to give a guess</l>
            <l>Is better than the person to express?</l>
            <l>But would you know who 'tis?  Would you hear her name?</l>
            <l>She is call'd mad Moll; her life, our acts proclaim.</l>

               <l>Have both our hands by th' hands of heaven been tied,</l>
               <l>Now to be broke?  I thought me once your bride:</l>

               <l>Sweet maid, let's lose no time.  'Tis in heaven's book</l>
               <l>Set down that I must have thee.  An oath we took</l>
               <l>To keep our vows, but when the knight your father</l>
               <l>Was from mine parted, storms began to sit</l>
               <l>Upon my covetous father's brow, which fell</l>
               <l>From them on me.  He reckon'd up what gold</l>
               <l>This marriage would draw from him, at which he swore</l>
               <l>To lose so much blood could not grieve him more.</l>
               <l>He then dissuades me from thee, call'd thee not fair,</l>
               <l>And ask'd what is she but a beggar's heir?</l>
               <l>He scorn'd thy dowry of five thousand <ref target="#MARKS">marks</ref>.</l>
               <l>If such a sum of money could be found,</l>
               <l>And I would match with that, he'd not undo it,</l>
               <l>Provided his bags might add nothing to it,</l>
               <l>But vow'd, if I took thee, nay, more, did swear it,</l>
               <l>Save birth from him I nothing should inherit.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SEBASTIAN </speaker>
               <l>Dear'st, no:</l>
               <l>Tho' wildly in a labyrinth I go,</l>
               <l>My end is to meet thee; with a side wind</l>
               <l>Must I now sail, else I no haven can find</l>
               <l>But both must sink forever.  There's a wench</l>
               <l>Call'd Moll, mad Moll or merry Moll, a creature</l>
               <l>So strange in quality a whole city takes</l>
               <l>Note of her name and person.  All that affection</l>
               <l>I owe to thee on her in counterfeit passion</l>
               <l>I spend to mad my father: he believes</l>
               <l>I dote upon this roaring girl, and grieves</l>
               <l>As it becomes a father for a son</l>
               <l>That could be so bewitch'd.  Yet I'll go on</l>
               <l>This crooked way, sigh still for her, feign dreams</l>
               <l>In which I'll talk only of her: these streams</l>
               <l>Shall, I hope, force my father to consent</l>
               <l>That here I anchor rather than be rent</l>
               <l>Upon a rock so dangerous.  Art thou pleas'd,</l>
               <l>Because thou seest we are waylaid, that I take</l>
               <l>A path that's safe, tho' it be far about?</l>

               <l>The furniture that doth adorn this room</l>
               <l>Cost many a fair <ref target="#GREYGROA">grey groat</ref> ere it came here,</l>

               <l>I know you had, good Master Laxton.  So, so.</l>
               <l>Now here's a <ref target="#MESS">mess</ref> of friends, and, gentlemen,</l>
               <l>Because time's glass shall not be running long,</l>

               <l>Good tales do well</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ADAM </speaker>
               <l>Begin, Sir Alexander.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ALEXANDER </speaker>
               <l>Last day I met</l>
               <l>An aged man upon whose head was scor'd</l>
               <l>A debt of just so many years as these</l>
               <l>Which I owe to my grave: the man you all know.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>OMNES</speaker>
               <l>His name I pray you, sir.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ALEXANDER </speaker>
               <l>Nay, you shall pardon me;</l>
               <l>But when he saw me, with a sigh that brake,</l>
               <l>Or seem'd to break, his <ref target="#HEARTSTR">heartstrings</ref>, thus he spake:</l>
               <l>"Oh, my good knight," says he, and then his eyes</l>
               <l>Were richer even by that which made them poor,</l>
               <l>They had spent so many tears they had no more.</l>
               <l>"Oh, sir," says he, "you know it, for you ha' seen</l>
               <l>Blessings to rain upon mine house and me:</l>
               <l>
                  <ref target="#FORTUNE">Fortune</ref>, who slaves men, was my slave; her wheel</l>
               <l>Hath spun me golden threads, for, I thank heaven,</l>
               <l>I ne'er had but one cause to curse my stars."</l>
               <l>I ask'd him then what that one cause might be.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>OMNES</speaker>
               <l>So, sir?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ALEXANDER</speaker>
               <l>He paus'd, and as we often see</l>
               <l>A sea so much becalm'd there can be found</l>
               <l>No wrinkle on his brow, his waves being drown'd</l>
               <l>In their own rage, but when th' imperious wind[s]</l>
               <l>Use strange invisible tyranny to shake</l>
               <l>Both heaven's and earth's foundation at their noise,</l>
               <l>The seas, swelling with wrath to part that fray,</l>
               <l>Rise up and are more wild, more mad, than they:</l>
               <l>Even so this good old man was by my question</l>
               <l>Stirr'd up to roughness, you might see his gall</l>
               <l>Flow even in's eyes.  Then grew he fantastical.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR DAVY </speaker>
               <l>Fantastical?  Ha, ha!</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ALEXANDER </speaker>
               <l>Yes, and talk['d] oddly.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ADAM </speaker>
               <l>Pray, sir, proceed:</l>
               <l>How did this old man end?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ALEXANDER</speaker>
               <l>Marry, sir, thus:</l>
               <l>He left his wild fit to <ref target="#READOERH">read o'er his cards</ref>,</l>
               <l>Yet then, though age cast snow on all his hairs,</l>
               <l>He joy'd because, says he, "The god of gold</l>
               <l>Has been to me no niggard: that disease</l>
               <l>Of which all old men sicken, avarice,</l>
               <l>Never infected me."</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ALEXANDER </speaker>
               <l>"For, like a lamp</l>
               <l>Fed with continual oil, I spend and throw</l>
               <l>My light to all that need it, yet have still</l>
               <l>Enough to serve myself.  Oh, but," quoth he,</l>
               <l>"Tho' heaven's dew fall thus on this aged tree,</l>
               <l>I have a son <ref target="#THATLIKE">that like</ref> a wedge doth cleave</l>

with that wench!  Life, sh'as the spirit of four great parishes,
and a voice that will drown all the city; methinks a brave captain
might get all his soldiers upon her and ne'er be beholding to
a company of <ref target="#MILEENDM">Mile End milksops</ref>, if he could come on and come off
quick enough.  Such a Moll were a <ref target="#MARROWBO">marrow-bone</ref> before an <ref target="#ITALIAN">Italian</ref>;
he would cry <ref target="#BONAROBA">bona roba</ref> till his ribs were nothing but bone.  I'll

sides a' th' bed myself; and again a' th' other side, a wife,
you know, ought to be obedient, but I fear me I am too headstrong
to obey, therefore I'll ne'er go about it.  I love you so well,
sir, for your good will I'd be loath you should repent your bargain
after, and therefore we'll ne'er come together <ref target="#ATFIRST">at first</ref>.  I have
the head now of myself and am man enough for a woman; marriage
is but <ref target="#ACHOPPIN">a chopping and changing</ref>, where a maiden loses one head

against a wall, and t'other to have his brains knock'd out with
a fiddle case.  What?  A loose chain and a dangling diamond.</l>

               <l>I scorn'd one woman thus should brave all men   </l>
               <l>And, which more vex'd me, a she-citizen.</l>
               <l>Therefore I laid siege to her; out she held,</l>
               <l>Gave many a brave repulse, and me compell'd</l>
               <l>With shame to sound retreat to my hot lust.</l>

               <l>And that to tempt her modest ears, I swore</l>
               <l>Ne'er to presume again.  She said her eye </l>

               <l>Your own and hers; did so.  Then seeing I wrought</l>
               <l>Upon her meekness, me she set at nought,</l>
               <l>And yet to try if I could turn that tide,</l>
               <l>You see what stream I strove with.  But, sir, I swear</l>
               <l>By heaven, and by those hopes men lay up there,</l>
               <l>I neither have nor had a base intent</l>

               <l>Your gold I pay back with this interest:</l>

in that trade, and snaps will have half in any booty.  He with
the wand is both a stale, whose office is to face a man i' the
streets whilst shells are drawn by another, and then with his
black conjuring rod in his hand, he, by the nimbleness of his
eye and juggling-stick, will in <ref target="#CHEAPING">cheaping</ref> a piece of plate at a

               <l>You're well met and most rightly served:</l>
               <l>My daughter was a scorn to you.</l>

               <l>A very abject she, poor gentlewoman;</l>
               <l>Your house <ref target="#HAS">[has]</ref> been dishonoured.  Give you joy, sir,</l>
               <l>Of your son's <ref target="#GASKINBR">gaskin-bride</ref>; you'll be a grandfather shortly</l>
               <l>To a fine crew of roaring sons and daughters:</l>

               <l>Oh, play not with the miseries of my heart!</l>
               <l>Wounds should be dress'd and heal'd, not vex'd or left</l>
               <l>Wide open to the anguish of the patient,</l>

               <l>And advice charitably help to refresh 'em.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR GUY </speaker>
               <l>Who'd place his charity so unworthily</l>
               <l>Like one that gives alms to a cursing beggar?</l>
               <l>Had I but found one spark of goodness in you</l>
               <l>Toward my deserving child, which then grew fond</l>
               <l>Of your son's virtues, I had eased you now;</l>
               <l>But I perceive both fire of youth and goodness</l>

               <l>Else no such shame should have come near your house,</l>

               <l>Full as uncertain.  Where's the place that holds 'em?</l>

               <l>Nay, I despair not now; my heart's cheer'd, gentlemen:</l>
               <l>No face can come unfortunately to me.</l>

               <l>Forgive me, father;</l>
               <l>Though there before your eyes my sorrow feigned,</l>
               <l>This still was she for whom true love complain'd.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SIR ALEXANDER </speaker>
               <l>Blessings eternal and the joys of angels</l>

               <l>How short my sleep of sorrow seems now to me</l>
               <l>To this eternity of boundless comforts</l>
               <l>That finds no want but utterance and expression!</l>
               <l>My lord, your office here appears so honourably,</l>
               <l>So full of ancient goodness, grace, and worthiness:</l>
               <l>I never took more joy in sight of man</l>

               <l>And which, old knight, thy nobleness may <ref target="#CHALLENG">challenge</ref>,</l>
               <l>Join'd with thy daughter's virtues, whom I prize now</l>

               <l>Forgive me, worthy gentlewoman, 'twas my blindness</l>
               <l>When I rejected thee; I saw thee not:</l>
               <l>Sorrow and willful rashness grew like films</l>
               <l>Over the eyes of judgment, now so clear</l>

               <l>Here, honest son, receive into thy hands</l>
               <l>The keys of wealth, possession of those lands</l>
               <l>Which my first care provided: they're thine own;</l>
               <l>Heaven give thee a blessing with 'em.  The best joys</l>
               <l>That can in worldly shapes to man betide</l>

               <hi> The Roaring Girl</hi>, the final dramatic collaboration between
Middleton and Thomas Dekker, first appeared in quarto in 1611.
 David Lake's textual analyses of both authors' works has confirmed
the date of composition as later rather than earlier in the first
decade of 1600, and he conjectures the date to be 1608.  However,
P. A. Mulholland [<q>The Date of <hi>The Roaring Girl</hi>,</q>
               <hi>RES</hi> 28 (1977)], citing allusions to contemporary events,
which I include in the glossary below, maintains a later date
of the spring of 1611, which I believe is more likely.  Lake and
others divide the shares as Dekker having written I, III.ii-iii,
IV.ii, V.i, and Middleton II, III.i, IV.i, V.ii, a roughly even
division, although some scenes are probably not solely from one
author's pen.  Dekker is undoubtedly the author of the canting
scene: the usages closely parallel his contemporary <hi>Bellman
of London</hi> and <hi>Lanthorn and Candlelight</hi> tracts.  Editions
of <hi>The Roaring Girl</hi> include Dyce's of 1840, Bullen's of
1885, Andor Gomme's for the New Mermaids Series (1976), and Fredson
Bowers's in <hi>The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker</hi> (1953-61),
with <hi>Introductions, Notes and Commentaries</hi> by Cyrus Hoy
(1980).</p>
            <p>
 The title of the play derives from the riotous gallants of London,
known as <q>roaring boys,</q> whose penchant for machismo
quarreling was parodied by Middleton and Rowley in <hi>
                  <ref target="http://www.tech.org/~cleary/fairq.html">A Fair Quarrel</ref>
               </hi>,
and by Jonson in <hi>
                  <ref target="http://www.hti.umich.edu/bin/pd-idx?type=header&amp;idno=JonsoAlche">The Alchemist</ref>
               </hi>.  The title character is
based upon Mary Frith, the real Moll Cutpurse, whose notorious
exploits tested the patience of proper society and often brought
her before the court.  Accounts of these exploits were variously
recorded, and they include wearing men's clothes, appearing on
the stage, drinking, swearing, making <q>immodest and lascivious
speeches,</q> prostitution, pick-pocketing, forgery, and highway
robbery.  A full rap sheet indeed but as the prologue, epilogue,
and epistle to the reader clearly demonstrate, Dekker and Middleton
were sympathetic to her, and through Moll offer, if not an apologia,
at least some well-needed positive public relations.  T. S. Eliot
observed that the character of Moll is the one exquisite jewel
in the crown of a rather mediocre play; without a doubt, she is
thoroughly engaging.  The loose and episodic structure of the
play, in fact, allows Dekker and Middleton to showcase her various
talents: she sings, she fights, she rescues Jack Dapper from the
clutches of the law; she is just as comfortable with lords and
gentlemen as with the thieves whose cant she speaks and over whom
she has some authority.  Moll's character is also amazingly well-rounded
in the Forsterian sense: Dekker and Middleton take her beyond
a presentation of the mere spectacle and her iconic status in
the contemporary culture.  We not only learn the <q>facts</q>
of her past, but we also hear her heart and mind in many candid
reactions to social prejudice and condemnation.  It is certainly
the best comic female role in the Middleton canon, and few comic
female roles of the time are its equal.

According to the <hi>Consistory of London Correction Book</hi>,
Mary Frith appeared before the court on 27 January 1612 for misdemeanors
and was subsequently incarcerated, a fact which Hoy believes informs
this quotation that appears beside her picture on the quarto title-page:
<q>At the time of the publication of the play, Mary Frith apparently
was beating hemp in Bridewell, in the manner of the loose women
Dekker had shown undergoing correction in that place some half-a-dozen
years before, in the final scene of <hi>The Honest Whore</hi>, Part
Two.</q>  As Gomme notes, the first half of the quotation is
proverbial, and gave title to Jonson's comedy of 1597.

               <label>vast theatre:</label> The Fortune Theater on Golden Lane in Cripplegate
(built 1600, burnt 1621, rebuilt 1623, finally destroyed 1662)
was 53 feet square inside (80 outside), and had three tiers of
galleries.  To the right, the reconstruction, based on the surviving contract,
is by W. H. Godfrey, and the engraving of
the theater in its last days is by T. H. Shepherd (1811).  It
was occupied by the Lord Admiral's Men (which became Prince Henry's
Men in 1603) under the management of Philip Henslowe and Edward
Alleyn, his son-in-law and a leading acting of the Admiral's Men.

<hi>The Caste of Knowledge</hi>, 1556 showing the Wheel of Fortune.
 Click on the image for the complete title-page (266 KB), which
illustrates the various concepts associated with the goddess Fortune,
in contrast to Urania, or Wisdom, on the left.  Fortune stands
unstably upon a ball, while Wisdom stands firmly on a block. 
She is blindfolded and turns her wheel, which can as easily bring
someone wealth one day as take it all away the next day, for <q>she
is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation</q>

rational knowledge) and the Sphere of Destiny.  Fortune is illuminated
by the moon, a symbol of irrationality and changefulness, and
Wisdom is illuminated by the sun, a symbol of reason and stability:
the inscription ends, <q>Though earth do honour Fortune's ball,/And
battles blind her wheel advance,/The heavens to Fortune are not
thrall:/These spheres surmount all Fortune's chance.</q>

               <q>Pot-herbs are simply herbs boiled
in a pot; perhaps a misunderstanding of how tobacco is prepared</q>
(Gomme).  The statement is not so much a misunderstanding in Laxton's
knowledge of tobacco as an inconsistency in the background of
the wives, for it is Mistress Openwork who later claims to have
been a lady's serving-woman, a <q>gentlewoman born.</q>  On
the other hand, it's entirely possible that neither of them came
from a higher social class, and that both merely make such a claim
as psychological leverage against their husbands (i.e., marrying
below their station) and to impress the gallants Laxton and Goshawk.

may be inviting Goshawk to draw in (= inhale) a thread of smoke;
or 'thread' may be a measure of tobacco as of yarn.  But 'draw
in' can mean inveigle or take in, and also, it seems, to lay down
a stake at dice (cf. <hi>

clear to me that Laxton, returning after his aside, has found
Goshawk and Greenwit sharing a bowl--I assume the gallants have
been sampling Gallipot's various tobaccos--and asks to be a third;
Goshawk refuses, claiming that Laxton himself never shares.

prompts 'shift' in the sense of chemise.  And the seemingly innocent
shopkeeping talk win the second sentence conceals a complex obscenity:
'ware' was in regular use for the privates of either sex, but

that by a trick (a shift) she is left to make what shift she can
by handling her sexual parts (those next to her shift) herself:
a barren ('dead') activity, but she may as well stop offering
herself, for when she opens up her 'shop', nothing comes in.

               <label>Holborn:</label> The area to the north of the Strand and northwest
of the old walled city, a place with an unsavory reputation, especially
toward the west end; it takes its name from the Holbourne, a tributary
of the Fleet.  It was also the center of the legal profession,
and contained the Inns of Court (Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, the
Middle Temple, and the Inner Temple), as well as the Inns of Chancery;
because of their frequent reference in this play, I feel compelled
to cite Weinreb and Hibbert's <title>The London Encyclopedia</title>:
<q>By the middle of the 15th century the Inns [of Chancery]
had largely been taken over by resident students and solicitors
and attorneys and had become preparatory schools for students
wishing to be called to the Bar by the Inns of Court which had
managed to secure a degree of control over the Inns of Chancery.
 By 1530 Furnival's and Thavies Inns had become affiliated to
Lincoln's Inn, while Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn looked to Gray's
Inn, and Clement's, Clifford's, and Lyon's Inns were affiliated
to the Inner Temple.  After the destruction of the Strand Inn
in 1549, the Middle Temple had only one Inn of Chancery, namely
New Inn.  Each Inn of Chancery normally comprised a Principal,
Ancients (Benchers) [magistrates] and Juniors or Companions (barristers
and students).  Unlike the Inns of Court, the Inns of Chancery--also
styled 'Honourable Societies'--had no power to call students to
the Bar but in most other respects their constitutions were similar
to those of the Inns of Court.  By 1600 eight Inns of Chancery
were in existence but, with the decline in the educational role
of these Inns, students were tending increasingly to enroll directly
in the Inns of Court.  At the same time the attorney and solicitors,
who were being gradually excluded from the Inns of Court, took
over the Inns of Chancery.</q>  For references to various Inns,

a ferret after it has been muzzled to smooth down the fur ruffled
by the muzzled.  Possibly the dog was similarly muzzled</q>
(Gomme).  Hoy replies, <q>Perhaps so; but other evidence suggests
that the action betokens some odd sign of affection bestowed on
a pet.  Cf. Jonson, <hi>Discoveries</hi>, lines 309-311: 'what hath
he done more, then a troublesome base curre? bark'd, and made

               <label>Demophon was false to Phyllis:</label>
               <q>Demophon, son of Theseus,
<hi>en route</hi> back to Athens at the end of the Trojan War, met
and married Phyllis, a Bisaltian princess.  When he tired of her
and announced his need to visit his mother in Athens, Phyllis
knew he would not return though he swore by all the gods that
he would be back within the year.  On his departure, she gave
him a casket containing a charm, with instructions to open it
when he had abandoned all hope of returning to her.  Instead of
going to Athens, Demophon settled in Cyprus.  At the end of a
year, Phyllis committed suicide.  In the same hour, Demophon was
prompted to look in the casket.  The contents (their nature undisclosed
in the myth) maddened him.  Galloping off insanely on his horse,
he was thrown and impaled on his own sword</q> (Hoy, referencing
Robert Graves, <hi>The Greek Myths</hi>).  Gomme confuses this with
another tale involving a Thracian princess named Phyllis at the
time of the Trojan War.

Gull would not be addressed before his master, and that the compositor

I tend to think the Q reading is correct, and that Moll's and
Trapdoor's lines were fused to convey the fact that they are acting

the trick: Moll accosts and in some way <q>hangs upon</q>

               <label>cant:</label>
               <q>It was necessary that a people, so fast increasing
and so daily practicing new and strange villainies, should borrow
to themselves a speech which, so near as thy could, none but themselves
could understand; and for that cause was this language, which
some call pedlar's French, invented....  This word canting seems
to be derived from the Latin verb <hi>canto</hi>, which signifies
in English to sing, or to make a sound with words, that's to say,
speak.  And very aptly may canting take his derivation <hi>a cantando</hi>,
from singing, because amongst these beggarly consorts that can
play upon no better instruments, the language of canting is a
kind of music, and he that in such assemblies can cant best is
counted the best musician</q> (<hi>Lanthorn and Candlelight</hi>).
 Some canting phrases have already been glossed above; Gomme provides
an excellent glossary, culled from works of Dekker and others
featuring canters' dictionaries.
