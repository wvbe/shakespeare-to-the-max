               <hi rend="invisible">A</hi>
	 mid the many celebrations last Christmas Eve, in various places by
	 different persons, there was one, in New York City, not like any other
	 anywhere. A company of men, women, and children went together just after
	 the evening service in their church, and, standing around the tomb of
	 the author of <q>A Visit from St. Nicholas,</q> recited together the words of
	 the poem which we all know so well and love so dearly.</p>
            <p>Dr. Clement C. Moore, who wrote the poem, never expected that he
	 would be remembered by it. If he expected to be famous at all as a
	 writer, he thought it would be because of the Hebrew Dictionary that he
	 wrote.</p>
            <p>He was born in a house near Chelsea Square, New York City, in 1781;
	 and he lived there all his life. It was a great big house, with
	 fireplaces in it; just the house to be living in on Christmas
	 Eve.</p>
            <p>Dr. Moore had children. He liked writing poetry for them even more
	 than he liked writing a Hebrew Dictionary. He wrote a whole book of
	 poems for them.</p>
            <p>One year he wrote this poem, which we usually call <q>'Twas the Night
	 before Christmas,</q> to give to his children for a Christmas present. They
	 read it just after they had <pb/>hung up their stockings before one of
	 the big fireplaces in their house. Afterward, they learned it, and
	 sometimes recited it, just as other children learn it and recite it
	 now.</p>
            <p>It was printed in a newspaper. Then a magazine printed it, and after
	 a time it was printed in the school readers. Later it was printed by
	 itself, with pictures. Then it was translated into German, French, and
	 many other languages. It was even made into <q>Braille</q>; which is the
	 raised printing that blind children read with their fingers. But never
	 has it been given to us in so attractive a form as in this book. It has
	 happened that almost all the children in the world know this poem. How
	 few of them know any Hebrew!</p>
            <p>Every Christmas Eve the young men studying to be ministers at the
	 General Theological Seminary, New York City, put a holly wreath around
	 Dr. Moore's picture, which is on the wall of their dining-room. Why?
	 Because he gave the ground on which the General Theological Seminary
	 stands? Because he wrote a Hebrew Dictionary? No. They do it because he
	 was the author of <q>A Visit from St. Nicholas.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Most of the children probably know the words of the poem. They are
	 old. But the pictures that Miss Jessie Willcox Smith has painted for
	 this edition of it are new. All the children, probably, have seen other
	 pictures painted by Miss Smith, showing children at other seasons of the
	 year. How much they will enjoy looking at these pictures, showing
	 children on that night that all children like best, Christmas
	 Eve!</p>
