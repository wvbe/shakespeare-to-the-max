            <lg>
               <l>THERE was a young Weſt-country man,</l>
               <l>A Carpenter by trade;</l>
               <l>A ſkilful wheelwright too was he,</l>
               <l>And few ſuch Waggons made.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>No Man a tighter Barn cou'd build,</l>
               <l>Throughout his native town,</l>
               <l>Thro' many a village round was he,</l>
               <l>The beſt of workmen known.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His father left him what he had,</l>
               <l>In ſooth it was enough;</l>
               <l>His ſhining pewter, pots of braſs,</l>
               <l>And all his houſehold ſtuff.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A little cottage too he had,</l>
               <l>For eaſe and comfort plann'd,</l>
               <l>And that he might not lack for ought,</l>
               <l>An acre of good land.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A pleaſant orchard too there was,</l>
               <l>Before his cottage door;</l>
               <l>Of cider and of corn likewiſe,</l>
               <l>He had a little ſtore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Active and healthy, ſtout and young,</l>
               <l>No buſineſs wanted he;</l>
               <l>Now tell me reader if you can,</l>
               <l>What man more bleſt cou'd be?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To make his comfort quite compleat,</l>
               <l>He had a faithful Wife;</l>
               <l>Frugal and neat and good was ſhe,</l>
               <l>The bleſſing of his life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where is the Lord, or where the Squire.</l>
               <l>Had greater cauſe to praiſe,</l>
               <l>The goodneſs of that bounteous hand,</l>
               <l>Which bleſt his proſp'rous days?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Each night when he return'd from work,</l>
               <l>His wife ſo meek and mild,</l>
               <l>His little ſupper gladly dreſs'd,</l>
               <l>While he careſs'd his child.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One blooming babe was all he had,</l>
               <l>His only darling dear,</l>
               <l>The object of their equal love,</l>
               <l>The ſolace of their care.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O what cou'd ruin ſuch a life,</l>
               <l>And ſpoil ſo fair a lot?</l>
               <l>O what cou'd change ſo kind a heart,</l>
               <l>All goodneſs quite forgot?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With grief the cauſe I muſt relate,</l>
               <l>The diſmal cauſe reveal,</l>
               <l>'Twas EVIL COMPANY and DRINK,</l>
               <l>The ſource of every ill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Cooper came to live hard by,</l>
               <l>Who did his fancy pleaſe;</l>
               <l>An idle rambling Man was he,</l>
               <l>Who oft had croſs'd the ſeas.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Man could tell a merry tale,</l>
               <l>And ſing a merry ſong;</l>
               <l>And thoſe who heard him ſing or talk,</l>
               <l>Ne'er thought the ev'ning long.</l>
            </lg>
            <figure/>
            <lg>
               <l>But vain and vicious was the ſong,</l>
               <l>And wicked was the tale;</l>
               <l>And every pauſe he always fill'd,</l>
               <l>With cider, gin, or ale.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Carpenter delighted much,</l>
               <l>To hear the Cooper talk;</l>
               <l>And with him to the Ale-houſe oft,</l>
               <l>Wou'd take his evening walk.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At firſt he did not care for drink,</l>
               <l>But only lik'd the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <l>But ſoon he from the Cooper learnt,</l>
               <l>The ſame ſad courſe to run.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He ſaid the Cooper's company,</l>
               <l>Was all for which he car'd;</l>
               <l>But ſoon he drank as much as he,</l>
               <l>To ſwear like him ſoon dar'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His hammer now neglected lay,</l>
               <l>For work he little car'd;</l>
               <l>Half finiſh'd wheels, and broken tools,</l>
               <l>Were ſtrew'd about his yard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To get him to attend his work,</l>
               <l>No prayers cou'd now prevail:</l>
               <l>His hatchet and his plane forgot,</l>
               <l>He never drove a Nail.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His chearful ev'nings now no more,</l>
               <l>With peace and plenty ſmil'd;</l>
               <l>No more he ſought his pleaſing Wife,</l>
               <l>Nor hugg'd his ſmiling child.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For not his drunken nights alone,</l>
               <l>Were with the Cooper paſt;</l>
               <l>His days were at the Angel ſpent,</l>
               <l>And ſtill he ſtay'd the laſt.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>No handſome Sunday ſuit was left,</l>

               <l>No noſegay mark'd the Sabbath day,</l>
               <l>But all was rags and dirt.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The cottage mortgag'd for its worth,</l>
               <l>The favourite orchard ſold;</l>
               <l>He ſoon began to feel th'effects</l>
