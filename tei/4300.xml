            <p>THE burden of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Taxes, induſtriouſly buzzed about into the Ears of the Commonalty, by ſuch as upon other Views were prejudiced againſt the preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Union, has no doubt contributed in a great meaſure, to work them into ſo general a ferment againſt it. Their weakneſs and incapacity to inquire into, and examine theſe Matters, joined with ſome mean prejudices from the fear of loſing the Crown and the like, made them a ſubject ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy to be wrought upon this way.</p>
            <p>That the Deſign might have the better Succeſs, all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods have been uſed, to ſcrue up theſe Burdens to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant heights, that their appearance might be more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It cannot be denied that in an Affair of this moment, to ſet Matters in their due light, was the duty of every Perſon that ventured to give the Publick his Opinion; but to fiſh for ways to magnify things, ſeems to have had ſome other End than the real Service of the Nation.</p>
            <p>To give a fair and diſtinct view, and to rectify Miſtakes as to theſe on Liquors, is the deſign of the following Sheet. For underſtanding of which, the Reader is deſired to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the following Particulars.</p>

            <p>FRom theſe two Views of the greater and leſſer Exciſe, It not only appears that the greater is no ſuch hideous monſter, as is commonly believed; but alſo that taking both Jointly we ſhould be full as eaſy as now, eſpecially with regard to

the Poorer ſort of People. Nay further, we ſhould be much eaſier, than we have been for ſeveral Years ſince the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. For from the 1ſt of <hi>June</hi> 1693, to the 1ſt of <hi>May</hi> 1695, our Exciſe was 2 <hi>Merks per</hi> Boll, and 3 <hi>Pennies per</hi> Pint, in all 6 <hi>Pennies per</hi> Pint, only half a <hi>Penny</hi> leſs than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> greater Exciſe. And from 1ſt of <hi>September</hi> 1695, to <hi>March</hi> 1697 5 <hi>Pennies per</hi> Pint, from thence to <hi>March</hi> 1698, 4 <hi>Pennies,</hi> and from thence to <hi>March</hi> 99, 6 <hi>Pennies</hi>; So that for a Tract of 6 Years, we were under an Exciſe near equal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in quantity, but vaſtly more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as will appear by the following two Conſiderations, 1<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> That the 4 Dear Years were part of theſe ſix, which conſidering the circumſtance of the Poor were hard enough under any Exciſe; but this is only a temporary Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the next is perpetual, <hi>viz.</hi> That we neither had then, nor have now, any diſtinction betwixt Small and Strong Ale; The conſequence of which, was that the Brewers find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Ale equal as to Exciſe, choſe rather to Brew Strong Ale, which would yield them ſix <hi>Pennies</hi> profite <hi>per</hi> Pint, than ſmall which yielded only two <hi>Pennies,</hi> yet Payed the ſame Exciſe; and accordingly the Ale commonly Sold then was 3 <hi>Pence per</hi> Pint, or 2 <hi>Pence</hi> and a Plack, which the poor People behooved either to Buy or Drink Water. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhould the Brewers Brew ſtrong Ale under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Exciſe, yet there will ſtill be good wholſom Drink for the poorer ſort at an eaſie Rate, by reaſon of the diſtinction of the Exciſe.</p>
            <p>If what is here advanced be true, as there is little reaſon to doubt, ſince it depends on Uncontraverted matters of fact, and a Plain and ſimple calcul: It may ſeem odd, that the Author of the <hi>Short View of our preſent Trade and Taxes,</hi> Page 4. Should ſuppoſe each Boll of Malt will produce 6. <hi>ſh.</hi>

               <hi>ſterl.</hi> Exciſe, and ſhould on this build his calcul of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Exciſe in caſe of the Union. No doubt, a Brewer for a Wager may produce near 8 <hi>ſh.</hi> Exciſe from a Boll, by Brewing Ale at 10 <hi>pennies per</hi> Pint true value; but he's a Mad Man if he does ſo for ordinary, ſince had he Brewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
