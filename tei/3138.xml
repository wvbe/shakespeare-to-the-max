            <p>The following Poem was commenced in the beginning of the year 
1799, and completed in the summer of 1805. 
</p>
            <p>The design and occasion of the work are described by the Author 
in his Preface to the EXCURSION, first published in 1814, where he 
thus speaks:— 
</p>
            <p>“Several years ago, when the Author retired to his native 
mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary 
work that might live, it was a reasonable thing that he should 
take a review of his own mind, and examine how far Nature and 
Education had qualified him for such an employment. 
</p>
            <p>“As subsidiary to this preparation, he undertook to record, in 
verse, the origin and progress of his own powers, as far as he was 
acquainted with them. 
</p>
            <p>“That work, addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for 
his knowledge and genius, and to whom the Author's intellect is 
deeply indebted, has been long finished; and the result of the 
investigation which gave rise to it, was a determination to 
compose a philosophical Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and 
Society, and to be entitled the ‘Recluse’; as having for its 
principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in 
retirement. 
</p>
            <p>“The preparatory poem is biographical, and conducts the history 
of the Author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope 
that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the 
arduous labour which he had proposed to himself; and the two works 
have the same kind of relation to each other, if he may so express 
himself, as the Ante-chapel has to the body of a Gothic church. 
Continuing this allusion, he may be permitted to add, that his 
minor pieces, which have been long before the public, when they 
shall be properly arranged, will be found by the attentive reader 
to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim 
to be likened to the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral 
recesses, ordinarily included in those edifices.” 
</p>
            <p>Such was the Author's language in the year 1814. 
</p>
            <p>It will thence be seen, that the present Poem was intended to be 
introductory to the RECLUSE, and that the RECLUSE, if completed, 
would have consisted of Three Parts. Of these, the Second Part 
alone, viz. the EXCURSION, was finished, and given to the world by 
the Author. 
</p>
            <p>The First Book of the First Part of the RECLUSE still remains in 
manuscript [now in print]; but the Third Part was only planned. 
The materials of which it would have been formed have, however, 
been incorporated, for the most part, in the Author's other 
Publications, written subsequently to the EXCURSION. 
</p>
            <p>The Friend, to whom the present Poem is addressed, was the late 
SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, who was resident in Malta, for the 
restoration of his health, when the greater part of it was 
composed. 
</p>
            <p>Mr. Coleridge read a considerable portion of the Poem while he 
was abroad; and his feelings, on hearing it recited by the Author 
(after his return to his own country), are recorded in his Verses, 
addressed to Mr. Wordsworth, which will be found in the “Sibylline 
Leaves,” p. 197, ed. 1817, or “Poetical Works,” by S. T. 
Coleridge, vol. i. p. 206. 
</p>
            <p>RYDAL MOUNT July 13th, 1850.

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>OH there is blessing in this gentle breeze, </l>
               <l>A visitant that while it fans my cheek </l>
               <l>Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings </l>
               <l>From the green fields, and from yon azure sky. </l>
               <l>Whate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come </l>
               <l>To none more grateful than to me; escaped </l>
               <l>From the vast city, where I long had pined </l>
               <l>A discontented sojourner: now free, </l>
               <l>Free as a bird to settle where I will. </l>
               <l>What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale </l>
               <l>Shall be my harbour? underneath what grove </l>
               <l>Shall I take up my home? and what clear stream </l>
               <l>Shall with its murmur lull me into rest? </l>
               <l>The earth is all before me. With a heart </l>
               <l>Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty, </l>
               <l>I look about; and should the chosen guide </l>
               <l>Be nothing better than a wandering cloud, </l>
               <l>I cannot miss my way. I breathe again! </l>
               <l>Trances of thought and mountings of the mind </l>
               <l>Come fast upon me: it is shaken off, </l>
               <l>That burthen of my own unnatural self, </l>
               <l>The heavy weight of many a weary day </l>
               <l>Not mine, and such as were not made for me. </l>
               <l>Long months of peace (if such bold word accord </l>
               <l>With any promises of human life), </l>
               <l>Long months of ease and undisturbed delight </l>
               <l>Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn, </l>
               <l>By road or pathway, or through trackless field, </l>
               <l>Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing </l>
               <l>Upon the river point me out my course? </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Dear Liberty! Yet what would it avail </l>
               <l>But for a gift that consecrates the joy? </l>
               <l>For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven </l>
               <l>Was blowing on my body, felt within </l>
               <l>A correspondent breeze, that gently moved </l>
               <l>With quickening virtue, but is now become </l>
               <l>A tempest, a redundant energy, </l>
               <l>Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both, </l>
               <l>And their congenial powers, that, while they join </l>
               <l>In breaking up a long-continued frost, </l>
               <l>Bring with them vernal promises, the hope </l>
               <l>Of active days urged on by flying hours,— </l>
               <l>Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought </l>
               <l>Abstruse, nor wanting punctual service high, </l>
               <l>Matins and vespers of harmonious verse! </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make </l>
               <l>A present joy the matter of a song, </l>
               <l>Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains </l>
               <l>That would not be forgotten, and are here </l>
               <l>Recorded: to the open fields I told </l>
               <l>A prophecy: poetic numbers came </l>
               <l>Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe </l>
               <l>A renovated spirit singled out, </l>
               <l>Such hope was mine, for holy services. </l>
               <l>My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's </l>
               <l>Internal echo of the imperfect sound; </l>
               <l>To both I listened, drawing from them both </l>
               <l>A cheerful confidence in things to come. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Content and not unwilling now to give </l>
               <l>A respite to this passion, I paced on </l>
               <l>With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length, </l>
               <l>To a green shady place, where down I sate </l>
               <l>Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice </l>
               <l>And settling into gentler happiness. </l>
               <l>'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day, </l>
               <l>With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun </l>
               <l>Two hours declined towards the west; a day </l>
               <l>With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass, </l>
               <l>And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove </l>
               <l>A perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts </l>
               <l>Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was made </l>
               <l>Of a known Vale, whither my feet should turn, </l>
               <l>Nor rest till they had reached the very door </l>
               <l>Of the one cottage which methought I saw. </l>
               <l>No picture of mere memory ever looked </l>
               <l>So fair; and while upon the fancied scene </l>
               <l>I gazed with growing love, a higher power </l>
               <l>Than Fancy gave assurance of some work </l>
               <l>Of glory there forthwith to be begun, </l>
               <l>Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused, </l>
               <l>Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon, </l>
               <l>Save when, amid the stately grove of oaks, </l>
               <l>Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup </l>
               <l>Dislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once </l>
               <l>To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound. </l>
               <l>From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun </l>
               <l>Had almost touched the horizon; casting then </l>
               <l>A backward glance upon the curling cloud </l>
               <l>Of city smoke, by distance ruralised; </l>
               <l>Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive, </l>
               <l>But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took, </l>
               <l>Even with the chance equipment of that hour, </l>
               <l>The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale. </l>
               <l>It was a splendid evening, and my soul </l>
               <l>Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked </l>
               <l>Aeolian visitations; but the harp </l>
               <l>Was soon defrauded, and the banded host </l>
               <l>Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds, </l>
               <l>And lastly utter silence! “Be it so; </l>
               <l>Why think of anything but present good?” </l>
               <l>So, like a home-bound labourer, I pursued </l>
               <l>My way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed </l>
               <l>Mild influence; nor left in me one wish </l>
               <l>Again to bend the Sabbath of that time </l>
               <l>To a servile yoke. What need of many words? </l>
               <l>A pleasant loitering journey, through three days </l>
               <l>Continued, brought me to my hermitage. </l>
               <l>I spare to tell of what ensued, the life </l>
               <l>In common things—the endless store of things, </l>
               <l>Rare, or at least so seeming, every day </l>
               <l>Found all about me in one neighbourhood— </l>
               <l>The self-congratulation, and, from morn </l>
               <l>To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene. </l>
               <l>But speedily an earnest longing rose </l>
               <l>To brace myself to some determined aim, </l>
               <l>Reading or thinking; either to lay up </l>
               <l>New stores, or rescue from decay the old </l>
               <l>By timely interference: and therewith </l>
               <l>Came hopes still higher, that with outward life </l>
               <l>I might endue some airy phantasies </l>
               <l>That had been floating loose about for years, </l>
               <l>And to such beings temperately deal forth </l>
               <l>The many feelings that oppressed my heart. </l>
               <l>That hope hath been discouraged; welcome light </l>
               <l>Dawns from the east, but dawns to disappear </l>
               <l>And mock me with a sky that ripens not </l>
               <l>Into a steady morning: if my mind, </l>
               <l>Remembering the bold promise of the past, </l>
               <l>Would gladly grapple with some noble theme, </l>
               <l>Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds </l>
               <l>Impediments from day to day renewed. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  And now it would content me to yield up </l>
               <l>Those lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts </l>
               <l>Of humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend! </l>
               <l>The Poet, gentle creature as he is, </l>
               <l>Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times; </l>
               <l>His fits when he is neither sick nor well, </l>
               <l>Though no distress be near him but his own </l>
               <l>Unmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased </l>
               <l>While she as duteous as the mother dove </l>

               <l>With me is now such passion, to be blamed </l>
               <l>No otherwise than as it lasts too long. </l>

               <l>Wrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid </l>

               <l>To firm devotion, zeal unquenchable, </l>
               <l>And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves. </l>
               <l>Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate </l>
               <l>How vanquished Mithridates northward passed, </l>
               <l>And, hidden in the cloud of years, became </l>
               <l>Odin, the Father of a race by whom </l>
               <l>Perished the Roman Empire: how the friends </l>
               <l>And followers of Sertorius, out of Spain </l>
               <l>Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles, </l>
               <l>And left their usages, their arts and laws, </l>
               <l>To disappear by a slow gradual death, </l>
               <l>To dwindle and to perish one by one, </l>
               <l>Starved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul </l>
               <l>Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred years </l>
               <l>Survived, and, when the European came </l>
               <l>With skill and power that might not be withstood, </l>
               <l>Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold </l>
               <l>And wasted down by glorious death that race </l>

               <l>How, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man, </l>
               <l>Unnamed among the chronicles of kings, </l>

               <l>Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles, </l>
               <l>Went single in his ministry across </l>
               <l>The Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed, </l>
               <l>But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about </l>
               <l>Withering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought </l>
               <l>Help at his need in Dalecarlia's mines: </l>
               <l>How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name </l>
               <l>Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower, </l>
               <l>All over his dear Country; left the deeds </l>

               <l>To people the steep rocks and river banks, </l>
               <l>Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul </l>
               <l>Of independence and stern liberty. </l>
               <l>Sometimes it suits me better to invent </l>
               <l>A tale from my own heart, more near akin </l>
               <l>To my own passions and habitual thoughts; </l>
               <l>Some variegated story, in the main </l>
               <l>Lofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts </l>
               <l>Before the very sun that brightens it, </l>
               <l>Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish, </l>
               <l>My last and favourite aspiration, mounts </l>
               <l>With yearning toward some philosophic song </l>
               <l>Of Truth that cherishes our daily life; </l>
               <l>With meditations passionate from deep </l>
               <l>Recesses in man's heart, immortal verse </l>
               <l>Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre; </l>
               <l>But from this awful burthen I full soon </l>
               <l>Take refuge and beguile myself with trust </l>
               <l>That mellower years will bring a riper mind </l>
               <l>And clearer insight. Thus my days are past </l>
               <l>In contradiction; with no skill to part </l>
               <l>Vague longing, haply bred by want of power, </l>
               <l>From paramount impulse not to be withstood, </l>
               <l>A timorous capacity, from prudence, </l>
               <l>From circumspection, infinite delay. </l>
               <l>Humility and modest awe, themselves </l>
               <l>Betray me, serving often for a cloak </l>
               <l>To a more subtle selfishness; that now </l>
               <l>Locks every function up in blank reserve, </l>
               <l>Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye </l>
               <l>That with intrusive restlessness beats off </l>
               <l>Simplicity and self-presented truth. </l>
               <l>Ah! better far than this, to stray about </l>
               <l>Voluptuously through fields and rural walks, </l>
               <l>And ask no record of the hours, resigned </l>
               <l>To vacant musing, unreproved neglect </l>
               <l>Of all things, and deliberate holiday. </l>
               <l>Far better never to have heard the name </l>
               <l>Of zeal and just ambition, than to live </l>
               <l>Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour </l>
               <l>Turns recreant to her task; takes heart again, </l>
               <l>Then feels immediately some hollow thought </l>
               <l>Hang like an interdict upon her hopes. </l>
               <l>This is my lot; for either still I find </l>
               <l>Some imperfection in the chosen theme, </l>
               <l>Or see of absolute accomplishment </l>
               <l>Much wanting, so much wanting, in myself, </l>
               <l>That I recoil and droop, and seek repose </l>
               <l>In listlessness from vain perplexity, </l>
               <l>Unprofitably travelling toward the grave, </l>
               <l>Like a false steward who hath much received </l>
               <l>And renders nothing back. </l>
               <l>                           Was it for this </l>
               <l>That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved </l>
               <l>To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song, </l>
               <l>And, from his alder shades and rocky falls, </l>
               <l>And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice </l>
               <l>That flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou, </l>
               <l>O Derwent! winding among grassy holms </l>
               <l>Where I was looking on, a babe in arms, </l>
               <l>Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts </l>
               <l>To more than infant softness, giving me </l>
               <l>Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind </l>
               <l>A foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm </l>
               <l>That Nature breathes among the hills and groves. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  When he had left the mountains and received </l>

               <l>That yet survive, a shattered monument </l>
               <l>Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed </l>
               <l>Along the margin of our terrace walk; </l>

               <l>In a small mill-race severed from his stream, </l>
               <l>Made one long bathing of a summer's day; </l>
               <l>Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked again </l>

               <l>The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height, </l>
               <l>Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone </l>
               <l>Beneath the sky, as if I had been born </l>
               <l>On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut </l>
               <l>Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport </l>
               <l>A naked savage, in the thunder shower. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up </l>

               <l>Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less </l>
               <l>In that beloved Vale to which erelong </l>
               <l>We were transplanted;—there were we let loose </l>

               <l>Frost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped </l>
               <l>The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy </l>
               <l>With store of springes o'er my shoulder hung </l>

               <l>Along the smooth green turf. Through half the night, </l>
               <l>Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied </l>
               <l>That anxious visitation;—moon and stars </l>
               <l>Were shining o'er my head. I was alone, </l>
               <l>And seemed to be a trouble to the peace </l>
               <l>That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befell </l>
               <l>In these night wanderings, that a strong desire </l>
               <l>O'erpowered my better reason, and the bird </l>
               <l>Which was the captive of another's toil </l>
               <l>Became my prey; and when the deed was done </l>
               <l>I heard among the solitary hills </l>
               <l>Low breathings coming after me, and sounds </l>
               <l>Of undistinguishable motion, steps </l>
               <l>Almost as silent as the turf they trod. </l>

               <l>  One summer evening (led by her) I found </l>
               <l>A little boat tied to a willow tree </l>
               <l>Within a rocky cave, its usual home. </l>
               <l>Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in </l>
               <l>Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth </l>
               <l>And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice </l>
               <l>Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on; </l>
               <l>Leaving behind her still, on either side, </l>
               <l>Small circles glittering idly in the moon, </l>
               <l>Until they melted all into one track </l>
               <l>Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows, </l>
               <l>Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point </l>
               <l>With an unswerving line, I fixed my view </l>
               <l>Upon the summit of a craggy ridge, </l>
               <l>The horizon's utmost boundary; far above </l>
               <l>Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky. </l>
               <l>She was an elfin pinnace; lustily </l>
               <l>I dipped my oars into the silent lake, </l>
               <l>And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat </l>
               <l>Went heaving through the water like a swan; </l>
               <l>When, from behind that craggy steep till then </l>
               <l>The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge, </l>
               <l>As if with voluntary power instinct, </l>
               <l>Upreared its head. I struck and struck again, </l>
               <l>And growing still in stature the grim shape </l>
               <l>Towered up between me and the stars, and still, </l>
               <l>For so it seemed, with purpose of its own </l>
               <l>And measured motion like a living thing, </l>
               <l>Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned, </l>
               <l>And through the silent water stole my way </l>
               <l>Back to the covert of the willow tree; </l>
               <l>There in her mooring-place I left my bark,— </l>
               <l>And through the meadows homeward went, in grave </l>
               <l>And serious mood; but after I had seen </l>
               <l>That spectacle, for many days, my brain </l>

               <l>At noon and 'mid the calm of summer nights, </l>
               <l>When, by the margin of the trembling lake, </l>
               <l>Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went </l>
               <l>In solitude, such intercourse was mine; </l>
               <l>Mine was it in the fields both day and night, </l>
               <l>And by the waters, all the summer long. </l>

               <l>  And in the frosty season, when the sun </l>

               <l>The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom, </l>
               <l>I heeded not their summons: happy time </l>
               <l>It was indeed for all of us—for me </l>
               <l>It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud </l>
               <l>The village clock tolled six,—I wheeled about, </l>
               <l>Proud and exulting like an untired horse </l>
               <l>That cares not for his home. All shod with steel, </l>
               <l>We hissed along the polished ice in games </l>
               <l>Confederate, imitative of the chase </l>
               <l>And woodland pleasures,—the resounding horn, </l>
               <l>The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare. </l>
               <l>So through the darkness and the cold we flew, </l>
               <l>And not a voice was idle; with the din </l>
               <l>Smitten, the precipices rang aloud; </l>
               <l>The leafless trees and every icy crag </l>
               <l>Tinkled like iron; while far distant hills </l>
               <l>Into the tumult sent an alien sound </l>
               <l>Of melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars </l>
               <l>Eastward were sparkling clear, and in the west </l>
               <l>The orange sky of evening died away. </l>
               <l>Not seldom from the uproar I retired </l>
               <l>Into a silent bay, or sportively </l>
               <l>Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, </l>
               <l>To cut across the reflex of a star </l>
               <l>That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed </l>
               <l>Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes, </l>
               <l>When we had given our bodies to the wind, </l>

               <l>Behind me did they stretch in solemn train, </l>

               <l>Single and of determined bounds; and hence </l>
               <l>I choose it rather at this time, than work </l>
               <l>Of ampler or more varied argument, </l>
               <l>Where I might be discomfited and lost: </l>
               <l>And certain hopes are with me, that to thee </l>
               <l>This labour will be welcome, honoured Friend! </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>THUS far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much </l>
               <l>Unvisited, endeavoured to retrace </l>
               <l>The simple ways in which my childhood walked; </l>
               <l>Those chiefly that first led me to the love </l>
               <l>Of rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet </l>
               <l>Was in its birth, sustained as might befall </l>
               <l>By nourishment that came unsought; for still </l>
               <l>From week to week, from month to month, we lived </l>
               <l>A round of tumult. Duly were our games </l>
               <l>Prolonged in summer till the daylight failed: </l>
               <l>No chair remained before the doors; the bench </l>
               <l>And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep </l>
               <l>The labourer, and the old man who had sate </l>
               <l>A later lingerer; yet the revelry </l>
               <l>Continued and the loud uproar: at last, </l>
               <l>When all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars </l>
               <l>Edged the black clouds, home and to bed we went, </l>
               <l>Feverish with weary joints and beating minds. </l>
               <l>Ah! is there one who ever has been young, </l>
               <l>Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride </l>
               <l>Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem? </l>
               <l>One is there, though the wisest and the best </l>
               <l>Of all mankind, who covets not at times </l>
               <l>Union that cannot be;—who would not give </l>
               <l>If so he might, to duty and to truth </l>
               <l>The eagerness of infantine desire? </l>
               <l>A tranquillising spirit presses now </l>
               <l>On my corporeal frame, so wide appears </l>
               <l>The vacancy between me and those days </l>
               <l>Which yet have such self-presence in my mind, </l>
               <l>That, musing on them, often do I seem </l>
               <l>Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself </l>
               <l>And of some other Being. A rude mass </l>
               <l>Of native rock, left midway in the square </l>
               <l>Of our small market village, was the goal </l>
               <l>Or centre of these sports; and when, returned </l>
               <l>After long absence, thither I repaired, </l>
               <l>Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place </l>
               <l>A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground </l>
               <l>That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream, </l>
               <l>And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know </l>
               <l>That more than one of you will think with me </l>
               <l>Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame </l>
               <l>From whom the stone was named, who there had sate, </l>
               <l>And watched her table with its huckster's wares </l>
               <l>Assiduous, through the length of sixty years. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  We ran a boisterous course; the year span round </l>
               <l>With giddy motion. But the time approached </l>
               <l>That brought with it a regular desire </l>
               <l>For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms </l>
               <l>Of Nature were collaterally attached </l>
               <l>To every scheme of holiday delight </l>
               <l>And every boyish sport, less grateful else </l>
               <l>And languidly pursued. </l>
               <l>                        When summer came, </l>
               <l>Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays, </l>
               <l>To sweep along the plain of Windermere </l>
               <l>With rival oars; and the selected bourne </l>
               <l>Was now an Island musical with birds </l>
               <l>That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle </l>
               <l>Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown </l>
               <l>With lilies of the valley like a field; </l>
               <l>And now a third small Island, where survived </l>
               <l>In solitude the ruins of a shrine </l>
               <l>Once to Our Lady dedicate, and served </l>
               <l>Daily with chaunted rites. In such a race </l>
               <l>So ended, disappointment could be none, </l>
               <l>Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy: </l>
               <l>We rested in the shade, all pleased alike, </l>
               <l>Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength, </l>
               <l>And the vain-glory of superior skill, </l>
               <l>Were tempered; thus was gradually produced </l>
               <l>A quiet independence of the heart; </l>
               <l>And to my Friend who knows me I may add, </l>
               <l>Fearless of blame, that hence for future days </l>
               <l>Ensued a diffidence and modesty, </l>
               <l>And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much, </l>
               <l>The self-sufficing power of Solitude. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare! </l>
               <l>More than we wished we knew the blessing then </l>
               <l>Of vigorous hunger—hence corporeal strength </l>
               <l>Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude </l>
               <l>A little weekly stipend, and we lived </l>
               <l>Through three divisions of the quartered year </l>
               <l>In penniless poverty. But now to school </l>
               <l>From the half-yearly holidays returned, </l>
               <l>We came with weightier purses, that sufficed </l>
               <l>To furnish treats more costly than the Dame </l>
               <l>Of the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied. </l>
               <l>Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground, </l>
               <l>Or in the woods, or by a river side </l>
               <l>Or shady fountains, while among the leaves </l>
               <l>Soft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun </l>
               <l>Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy. </l>
               <l>Nor is my aim neglected if I tell </l>
               <l>How sometimes, in the length of those half-years, </l>
               <l>We from our funds drew largely;—proud to curb, </l>
               <l>And eager to spur on, the galloping steed; </l>
               <l>And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud </l>
               <l>Supplied our want, we haply might employ </l>
               <l>Sly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound </l>
               <l>Were distant: some famed temple where of yore </l>
               <l>The Druids worshipped, or the antique walls </l>
               <l>Of that large abbey, where within the Vale </l>
               <l>Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built, </l>
               <l>Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch, </l>
               <l>Belfry, and images, and living trees; </l>
               <l>A holy scene!—Along the smooth green turf </l>
               <l>Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace, </l>
               <l>Left by the west wind sweeping overhead </l>
               <l>From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers </l>
               <l>In that sequestered valley may be seen, </l>
               <l>Both silent and both motionless alike; </l>
               <l>Such the deep shelter that is there, and such </l>
               <l>The safeguard for repose and quietness. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Our steeds remounted and the summons given, </l>
               <l>With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew </l>
               <l>In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight, </l>
               <l>And the stone-abbot, and that single wren </l>
               <l>Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave </l>
               <l>Of the old church, that—though from recent showers </l>
               <l>The earth was comfortless, and, touched by faint </l>
               <l>Internal breezes, sobbings of the place </l>
               <l>And respirations, from the roofless walls </l>
               <l>The shuddering ivy dripped large drops—yet still </l>
               <l>So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird </l>
               <l>Sang to herself, that there I could have made </l>
               <l>My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there </l>
               <l>To hear such music. Through the walls we flew </l>
               <l>And down the valley, and, a circuit made </l>
               <l>In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth </l>
               <l>We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams, </l>
               <l>And that still spirit shed from evening air! </l>
               <l>Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt </l>
               <l>Your presence, when with slackened step we breathed </l>
               <l>Along the sides of the steep hills, or when </l>
               <l>Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea </l>
               <l>We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Midway on long Winander's eastern shore, </l>
               <l>Within the crescent of pleasant bay, </l>
               <l>A tavern stood; no homely-featured house, </l>
               <l>Primeval like its neighbouring cottages, </l>
               <l>But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset </l>
               <l>With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within </l>
               <l>Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine. </l>
               <l>In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built </l>
               <l>On the large island, had this dwelling been </l>
               <l>More worthy of a poet's love, a hut, </l>
               <l>Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade. </l>
               <l>But—though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed </l>
               <l>The threshold, and large golden characters, </l>
               <l>Spread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged </l>
               <l>The old Lion and usurped his place, in slight </l>
               <l>And mockery of the rustic painter's hand— </l>
               <l>Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dear </l>
               <l>With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay </l>
               <l>Upon a slope surmounted by a plain </l>
               <l>Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood </l>
               <l>A grove, with gleams of water through the trees </l>
               <l>And over the tree-tops; nor did we want </l>
               <l>Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream. </l>
               <l>There, while through half an afternoon we played </l>
               <l>On the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed </l>
               <l>Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee </l>
               <l>Made all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall, </l>
               <l>When in our pinnace we returned at leisure </l>
               <l>Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach </l>
               <l>Of some small island steered our course with one, </l>
               <l>The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there, </l>
               <l>And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute </l>
               <l>Alone upon the rock—oh, then, the calm </l>
               <l>And dead still water lay upon my mind </l>
               <l>Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky, </l>
               <l>Never before so beautiful, sank down </l>
               <l>Into my heart, and held me like a dream! </l>
               <l>Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus </l>
               <l>Daily the common range of visible things </l>
               <l>Grew dear to me: already I began </l>
               <l>To love the sun; a boy I loved the sun, </l>
               <l>Not as I since have loved him, as a pledge </l>
               <l>And surety of our earthly life, a light </l>
               <l>Which we behold and feel we are alive; </l>
               <l>Nor for his bounty to so many worlds— </l>
               <l>But for this cause, that I had seen him lay </l>
               <l>His beauty on the morning hills, had seen </l>
               <l>The western mountain touch his setting orb, </l>
               <l>In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess </l>
               <l>Of happiness, my blood appeared to flow </l>
               <l>For its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy. </l>
               <l>And, from like feelings, humble though intense, </l>
               <l>To patriotic and domestic love </l>
               <l>Analogous, the moon to me was dear; </l>
               <l>For I could dream away my purposes, </l>
               <l>Standing to gaze upon her while she hung </l>
               <l>Midway between the hills, as if she knew </l>
               <l>No other region, but belonged to thee, </l>
               <l>Yea, appertained by a peculiar right </l>
               <l>To thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale! </l>

               <l>  Those incidental charms which first attached </l>

               <l>Not as our glory and our absolute boast, </l>
               <l>But as a succedaneum, and a prop </l>

               <l>No outcast he, bewildered and depressed: </l>
               <l>Along his infant veins are interfused </l>
               <l>The gravitation and the filial bond </l>
               <l>Of nature that connect him with the world. </l>
               <l>Is there a flower, to which he points with hand </l>
               <l>Too weak to gather it, already love </l>
               <l>Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him </l>
               <l>Hath beautified that flower; already shades </l>
               <l>Of pity cast from inward tenderness </l>
               <l>Do fall around him upon aught that bears </l>
               <l>Unsightly marks of violence or harm. </l>
               <l>Emphatically such a Being lives, </l>
               <l>Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail, </l>
               <l>An inmate of this active universe: </l>
               <l>For, feeling has to him imparted power </l>
               <l>That through the growing faculties of sense </l>
               <l>Doth like an agent of the one great Mind </l>
               <l>Create, creator and receiver both, </l>
               <l>Working but in alliance with the works </l>
               <l>Which it beholds.—Such, verily, is the first </l>
               <l>Poetic spirit of our human life, </l>
               <l>By uniform control of after years, </l>
               <l>In most, abated or suppressed; in some, </l>
               <l>Through every change of growth and of decay, </l>
               <l>Pre-eminent till death. </l>
               <l>                         From early days, </l>
               <l>Beginning not long after that first time </l>
               <l>In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch </l>
               <l>I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart, </l>
               <l>I have endeavoured to display the means </l>
               <l>Whereby this infant sensibility, </l>
               <l>Great birthright of our being, was in me </l>
               <l>Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path </l>
               <l>More difficult before me; and I fear </l>
               <l>That in its broken windings we shall need </l>
               <l>The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing: </l>
               <l>For now a trouble came into my mind </l>
               <l>From unknown causes. I was left alone </l>
               <l>Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why. </l>
               <l>The props of my affections were removed, </l>
               <l>And yet the building stood, as if sustained </l>
               <l>By its own spirit! All that I beheld </l>
               <l>Was dear, and hence to finer influxes </l>
               <l>The mind lay open to a more exact </l>
               <l>And close communion. Many are our joys </l>
               <l>In youth, but oh! what happiness to live </l>
               <l>When every hour brings palpable access </l>
               <l>Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight, </l>
               <l>And sorrow is not there! The seasons came, </l>
               <l>And every season wheresoe'er I moved </l>
               <l>Unfolded transitory qualities, </l>
               <l>Which, but for this most watchful power of love, </l>
               <l>Had been neglected; left a register </l>
               <l>Of permanent relations, else unknown. </l>
               <l>Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude </l>
               <l>More active ever than “best society”— </l>
               <l>Society made sweet as solitude </l>
               <l>By silent inobtrusive sympathies, </l>
               <l>And gentle agitations of the mind </l>
               <l>From manifold distinctions, difference </l>
               <l>Perceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye, </l>
               <l>No difference is, and hence, from the same source, </l>
               <l>Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone, </l>
               <l>Under the quiet stars, and at that time </l>
               <l>Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound </l>
               <l>To breathe an elevated mood, by form </l>
               <l>Or image unprofaned; and I would stand, </l>
               <l>If the night blackened with a coming storm, </l>
               <l>Beneath some rock, listening to notes that are </l>
               <l>The ghostly language of the ancient earth, </l>
               <l>Or make their dim abode in distant winds. </l>
               <l>Thence did I drink the visionary power; </l>
               <l>And deem not profitless those fleeting moods </l>
               <l>Of shadowy exultation: not for this, </l>
               <l>That they are kindred to our purer mind </l>
               <l>And intellectual life; but that the soul, </l>
               <l>Remembering how she felt, but what she felt </l>
               <l>Remembering not, retains an obscure sense </l>
               <l>Of possible sublimity, whereto </l>
               <l>With growing faculties she doth aspire, </l>
               <l>With faculties still growing, feeling still </l>
               <l>That whatsoever point they gain, they yet </l>
               <l>Have something to pursue. </l>
               <l>                           And not alone, </l>
               <l>'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less 'mid fair </l>
               <l>And tranquil scenes, that universal power </l>
               <l>And fitness in the latent qualities </l>
               <l>And essences of things, by which the mind </l>
               <l>Is moved with feelings of delight, to me </l>
               <l>Came strengthened with a superadded soul, </l>
               <l>A virtue not its own. My morning walks </l>
               <l>Were early;—oft before the hours of school </l>
               <l>I travelled round our little lake, five miles </l>
               <l>Of pleasant wandering. Happy time! more dear </l>
               <l>For this, that one was by my side, a Friend, </l>
               <l>Then passionately loved; with heart how full </l>
               <l>Would he peruse these lines! For many years </l>
               <l>Have since flowed in between us, and, our minds </l>
               <l>Both silent to each other, at this time </l>
               <l>We live as if those hours had never been. </l>
               <l>Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch </l>
               <l>Far earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen </l>
               <l>From human dwelling, or the vernal thrush </l>
               <l>Was audible; and sate among the woods </l>
               <l>Alone upon some jutting eminence, </l>
               <l>At the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale, </l>
               <l>Yet slumbering, lay in utter solitude. </l>
               <l>How shall I seek the origin? where find </l>
               <l>Faith in the marvellous things which then I felt? </l>
               <l>Oft in these moments such a holy calm </l>
               <l>Would overspread my soul, that bodily eyes </l>
               <l>Were utterly forgotten, and what I saw </l>
               <l>Appeared like something in myself, a dream, </l>
               <l>A prospect in the mind. </l>
               <l>                        'Twere long to tell </l>
               <l>What spring and autumn, what the winter snows, </l>
               <l>And what the summer shade, what day and night, </l>
               <l>Evening and morning, sleep and waking, thought </l>
               <l>From sources inexhaustible, poured forth </l>
               <l>To feed the spirit of religious love </l>
               <l>In which I walked with Nature. But let this </l>
               <l>Be not forgotten, that I still retained </l>
               <l>My first creative sensibility; </l>
               <l>That by the regular action of the world </l>
               <l>My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power </l>
               <l>Abode with me; a forming hand, at times </l>
               <l>Rebellious, acting in a devious mood; </l>
               <l>A local spirit of his own, at war </l>
               <l>With general tendency, but, for the most, </l>
               <l>Subservient strictly to external things </l>
               <l>With which it communed. An auxiliar light </l>
               <l>Came from my mind, which on the setting sun </l>
               <l>Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds, </l>
               <l>The fluttering breezes, fountains that run on </l>
               <l>Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed </l>
               <l>A like dominion, and the midnight storm </l>
               <l>Grew darker in the presence of my eye: </l>
               <l>Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence, </l>
               <l>And hence my transport. </l>
               <l>                         Nor should this, perchance, </l>
               <l>Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved </l>
               <l>The exercise and produce of a toil, </l>
               <l>Than analytic industry to me </l>
               <l>More pleasing, and whose character I deem </l>
               <l>Is more poetic as resembling more </l>
               <l>Creative agency. The song would speak </l>
               <l>Of that interminable building reared </l>
               <l>By observation of affinities </l>
               <l>In objects where no brotherhood exists </l>
               <l>To passive minds. My seventeenth year was come </l>
               <l>And, whether from this habit rooted now </l>
               <l>So deeply in my mind, or from excess </l>
               <l>In the great social principle of life </l>
               <l>Coercing all things into sympathy, </l>
               <l>To unorganic natures were transferred </l>
               <l>My own enjoyments; or the power of truth </l>
               <l>Coming in revelation, did converse </l>
               <l>With things that really are; I, at this time, </l>
               <l>Saw blessings spread around me like a sea. </l>
               <l>Thus while the days flew by, and years passed on, </l>
               <l>From Nature and her overflowing soul, </l>
               <l>I had received so much, that all my thoughts </l>
               <l>Were steeped in feeling; I was only then </l>
               <l>Contented, when with bliss ineffable </l>
               <l>I felt the sentiment of Being spread </l>
               <l>O'er all that moves and all that seemeth still; </l>
               <l>O'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought </l>
               <l>And human knowledge, to the human eye </l>
               <l>Invisible, yet liveth to the heart; </l>
               <l>O'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings, </l>
               <l>Or beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides </l>
               <l>Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself, </l>
               <l>And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not </l>
               <l>If high the transport, great the joy I felt, </l>
               <l>Communing in this sort through earth and heaven </l>
               <l>With every form of creature, as it looked </l>
               <l>Towards the Uncreated with a countenance </l>
               <l>Of adoration, with an eye of love. </l>
               <l>One song they sang, and it was audible, </l>
               <l>Most audible, then, when the fleshly ear, </l>
               <l>O'ercome by humblest prelude of that strain </l>
               <l>Forgot her functions, and slept undisturbed. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  If this be error, and another faith </l>
               <l>Find easier access to the pious mind, </l>
               <l>Yet were I grossly destitute of all </l>
               <l>Those human sentiments that make this earth </l>
               <l>So dear, if I should fail with grateful voice </l>
               <l>To speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakes </l>
               <l>And sounding cataracts, ye mists and winds </l>
               <l>That dwell among the hills where I was born. </l>
               <l>If in my youth I have been pure in heart, </l>
               <l>If, mingling with the world, I am content </l>
               <l>With my own modest pleasures, and have lived </l>
               <l>With God and Nature communing, removed </l>
               <l>From little enmities and low desires— </l>
               <l>The gift is yours; if in these times of fear, </l>
               <l>This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown, </l>
               <l>If, 'mid indifference and apathy, </l>
               <l>And wicked exultation when good men </l>
               <l>On every side fall off, we know not how, </l>
               <l>To selfishness, disguised in gentle names </l>
               <l>Of peace and quiet and domestic love </l>
               <l>Yet mingled not unwillingly with sneers </l>
               <l>On visionary minds; if, in this time </l>
               <l>Of dereliction and dismay, I yet </l>
               <l>Despair not of our nature, but retain </l>
               <l>A more than Roman confidence, a faith </l>
               <l>That fails not, in all sorrow my support, </l>
               <l>The blessing of my life—the gift is yours, </l>
               <l>Ye winds and sounding cataracts! 'tis yours, </l>
               <l>Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed </l>
               <l>My lofty speculations; and in thee, </l>
               <l>For this uneasy heart of ours, I find </l>
               <l>A never-failing principle of joy </l>
               <l>And purest passion. </l>
               <l>                     Thou, my Friend! wert reared </l>
               <l>In the great city, 'mid far other scenes; </l>
               <l>But we, by different roads, at length have gained </l>
               <l>The selfsame bourne. And for this cause to thee </l>
               <l>I speak, unapprehensive of contempt, </l>
               <l>The insinuated scoff of coward tongues, </l>
               <l>And all that silent language which so oft </l>
               <l>In conversation between man and man </l>
               <l>Blots from the human countenance all trace </l>
               <l>Of beauty and of love. For thou hast sought </l>
               <l>The truth in solitude, and, since the days </l>
               <l>That gave thee liberty, full long desired, </l>
               <l>To serve in Nature's temple, thou hast been </l>
               <l>The most assiduous of her ministers; </l>
               <l>In many things my brother, chiefly here </l>
               <l>In this our deep devotion. </l>
               <l>                            Fare thee well! </l>
               <l>Health and the quiet of a healthful mind </l>
               <l>Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men, </l>
               <l>And yet more often living with thyself, </l>
               <l>And for thyself, so haply shall thy days </l>

               <l>IT was a dreary morning when the wheels </l>
               <l>Rolled over a wide plain o'erhung with clouds, </l>
               <l>And nothing cheered our way till first we saw </l>
               <l>The long-roofed chapel of King's College lift </l>
               <l>Turrets and pinnacles in answering files, </l>
               <l>Extended high above a dusky grove. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Advancing, we espied upon the road </l>
               <l>A student clothed in gown and tasselled cap, </l>
               <l>Striding along as if o'ertasked by Time, </l>
               <l>Or covetous of exercise and air; </l>
               <l>He passed—nor was I master of my eyes </l>
               <l>Till he was left an arrow's flight behind. </l>
               <l>As near and nearer to the spot we drew, </l>
               <l>It seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force. </l>

               <l>Drooped not; but there into herself returning, </l>
               <l>With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore. </l>
               <l>At least I more distinctly recognised </l>
               <l>Her native instincts: let me dare to speak </l>
               <l>A higher language, say that now I felt </l>
               <l>What independent solaces were mine, </l>
               <l>To mitigate the injurious sway of place </l>
               <l>Or circumstance, how far soever changed </l>
               <l>In youth, or ‘to’ be changed in after years. </l>
               <l>As if awakened, summoned, roused, constrained, </l>
               <l>I looked for universal things; perused </l>
               <l>The common countenance of earth and sky: </l>
               <l>Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace </l>
               <l>Of that first Paradise whence man was driven; </l>
               <l>And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed </l>
               <l>By the proud name she bears—the name of Heaven. </l>
               <l>I called on both to teach me what they might; </l>
               <l>Or, turning the mind in upon herself, </l>
               <l>Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts </l>
               <l>And spread them with a wider creeping; felt </l>
               <l>Incumbencies more awful, visitings </l>
               <l>Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul, </l>
               <l>That tolerates the indignities of Time, </l>
               <l>And, from the centre of Eternity </l>
               <l>All finite motions overruling, lives </l>
               <l>In glory immutable. But peace! enough </l>
               <l>Here to record that I was mounting now </l>
               <l>To such community with highest truth— </l>
               <l>A track pursuing, not untrod before, </l>
               <l>From strict analogies by thought supplied </l>
               <l>Or consciousnesses not to be subdued. </l>
               <l>To every natural form, rock, fruits, or flower, </l>
               <l>Even the loose stones that cover the highway, </l>
               <l>I gave a moral life: I saw them feel, </l>
               <l>Or linked them to some feeling: the great mass </l>
               <l>Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all </l>
               <l>That I beheld respired with inward meaning. </l>
               <l>Add that whate'er of Terror or of Love </l>
               <l>Or Beauty, Nature's daily face put on </l>
               <l>From transitory passion, unto this </l>
               <l>I was as sensitive as waters are </l>
               <l>To the sky's influence in a kindred mood </l>
               <l>Of passion; was obedient as a lute </l>
               <l>That waits upon the touches of the wind. </l>
               <l>Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich— </l>
               <l>I had a world about me—'twas my own; </l>
               <l>I made it, for it only lived to me, </l>
               <l>And to the God who sees into the heart. </l>
               <l>Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed </l>
               <l>By outward gestures and by visible looks: </l>
               <l>Some called it madness—so indeed it was, </l>

               <l>To inspiration, sort with such a name; </l>
               <l>If prophecy be madness; if things viewed </l>

               <l>By the first men, earth's first inhabitants, </l>

               <l>Was searching out the lines of difference </l>
               <l>As they lie hid in all external forms, </l>

               <l>That garden of great intellects, undisturbed. </l>
               <l>Place also by the side of this dark sense </l>
               <l>Of noble feeling, that those spiritual men, </l>
               <l>Even the great Newton's own ethereal self, </l>
               <l>Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be </l>
               <l>The more endeared. Their several memories here </l>
               <l>(Even like their persons in their portraits clothed </l>
               <l>With the accustomed garb of daily life) </l>

               <l>  Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington </l>
               <l>I laughed with Chaucer in the hawthorn shade; </l>
               <l>Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales </l>
               <l>Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard, </l>
               <l>Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State— </l>
               <l>Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven </l>
               <l>With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace, </l>
               <l>I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend! </l>
               <l>Yea, our blind Poet, who in his later day, </l>
               <l>Stood almost single; uttering odious truth— </l>
               <l>Darkness before, and danger's voice behind, </l>
               <l>Soul awful—if the earth has ever lodged </l>
               <l>An awful soul—I seemed to see him here </l>
               <l>Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress </l>
               <l>Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth— </l>
               <l>A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks </l>
               <l>Angelical, keen eye, courageous look, </l>
               <l>And conscious step of purity and pride. </l>
               <l>Among the band of my compeers was one </l>
               <l>Whom chance had stationed in the very room </l>
               <l>Honoured by Milton's name. O temperate Bard! </l>
               <l>Be it confest that, for the first time, seated </l>
               <l>Within thy innocent lodge and oratory, </l>
               <l>One of a festive circle, I poured out </l>
               <l>Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride </l>
               <l>And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain </l>
               <l>Never excited by the fumes of wine </l>
               <l>Before that hour, or since. Then, forth I ran </l>
               <l>From the assembly; through a length of streets, </l>
               <l>Ran, ostrich-like, to reach our chapel door </l>
               <l>In not a desperate or opprobrious time, </l>
               <l>Albeit long after the importunate bell </l>
               <l>Had stopped, with wearisome Cassandra voice </l>
               <l>No longer haunting the dark winter night. </l>
               <l>Call back, O Friend! a moment to thy mind, </l>
               <l>The place itself and fashion of the rites. </l>
               <l>With careless ostentation shouldering up </l>
               <l>My surplice, through the inferior throng I clove </l>
               <l>Of the plain Burghers, who in audience stood </l>
               <l>On the last skirts of their permitted ground, </l>
               <l>Under the pealing organ. Empty thoughts! </l>
               <l>I am ashamed of them: and that great Bard, </l>
               <l>And thou, O Friend! who in thy ample mind </l>
               <l>Hast placed me high above my best deserts, </l>
               <l>Ye will forgive the weakness of that hour, </l>
               <l>In some of its unworthy vanities, </l>
               <l>Brother to many more. </l>
               <l>                      In this mixed sort </l>
               <l>The months passed on, remissly, not given up </l>
               <l>To wilful alienation from the right, </l>
               <l>Or walks of open scandal, but in vague </l>
               <l>And loose indifference, easy likings, aims </l>
               <l>Of a low pitch—duty and zeal dismissed, </l>
               <l>Yet Nature, or a happy course of things </l>
               <l>Not doing in their stead the needful work. </l>
               <l>The memory languidly revolved, the heart </l>
               <l>Reposed in noontide rest, the inner pulse </l>
               <l>Of contemplation almost failed to beat. </l>
               <l>Such life might not inaptly be compared </l>
               <l>To a floating island, an amphibious spot </l>
               <l>Unsound, of spongy texture, yet withal </l>
               <l>Not wanting a fair face of water weeds </l>
               <l>And pleasant flowers. The thirst of living praise, </l>
               <l>Fit reverence for the glorious Dead, the sight </l>
               <l>Of those long vistas, sacred catacombs, </l>
               <l>Where mighty ‘minds’ lie visibly entombed, </l>
               <l>Have often stirred the heart of youth, and bred </l>
               <l>A fervent love of rigorous discipline.— </l>
               <l>Alas! such high emotion touched not me. </l>
               <l>Look was there none within these walls to shame </l>
               <l>My easy spirits, and discountenance </l>
               <l>Their light composure, far less to instil </l>
               <l>A calm resolve of mind, firmly addressed </l>
               <l>To puissant efforts. Nor was this the blame </l>
               <l>Of others but my own; I should, in truth, </l>
               <l>As far as doth concern my single self, </l>
               <l>Misdeem most widely, lodging it elsewhere: </l>
               <l>For I, bred up, 'mid Nature's luxuries, </l>
               <l>Was a spoiled child, and, rumbling like the wind, </l>
               <l>As I had done in daily intercourse </l>
               <l>With those crystalline rivers, solemn heights, </l>
               <l>And mountains, ranging like a fowl of the air, </l>
               <l>I was ill-tutored for captivity; </l>
               <l>To quit my pleasure, and, from month to month, </l>
               <l>Take up a station calmly on the perch </l>
               <l>Of sedentary peace. Those lovely forms </l>
               <l>Had also left less space within my mind, </l>
               <l>Which, wrought upon instinctively, had found </l>
               <l>A freshness in those objects of her love, </l>
               <l>A winning power, beyond all other power. </l>
               <l>Not that I slighted books,—that were to lack </l>
               <l>All sense,—but other passions in me ruled, </l>
               <l>Passions more fervent, making me less prompt </l>
               <l>To in-door study than was wise or well, </l>
               <l>Or suited to those years. Yet I, though used </l>
               <l>In magisterial liberty to rove, </l>
               <l>Culling such flowers of learning as might tempt </l>
               <l>A random choice, could shadow forth a place </l>
               <l>(If now I yield not to a flattering dream) </l>
               <l>Whose studious aspect should have bent me down </l>
               <l>To instantaneous service; should at once </l>
               <l>Have made me pay to science and to arts </l>
               <l>And written lore, acknowledged my liege lord, </l>
               <l>A homage frankly offered up, like that </l>
               <l>Which I had paid to Nature. Toil and pains </l>
               <l>In this recess, by thoughtful Fancy built, </l>
               <l>Should spread from heart to heart; and stately groves, </l>
               <l>Majestic edifices, should not want </l>
               <l>A corresponding dignity within. </l>
               <l>The congregating temper that pervades </l>
               <l>Our unripe years, not wasted, should be taught </l>
               <l>To minister to works of high attempt— </l>
               <l>Works which the enthusiast would perform with love. </l>
               <l>Youth should be awed, religiously possessed </l>
               <l>With a conviction of the power that waits </l>
               <l>On knowledge, when sincerely sought and prized </l>
               <l>For its own sake, on glory and on praise </l>
               <l>If but by labour won, and fit to endure </l>
               <l>The passing day; should learn to put aside </l>
               <l>Her trappings here, should strip them off abashed </l>
               <l>Before antiquity and stedfast truth </l>
               <l>And strong book-mindedness; and over all </l>
               <l>A healthy sound simplicity should reign, </l>
               <l>A seemly plainness, name it what you will, </l>
               <l>Republican or pious. </l>
               <l>                      If these thoughts </l>
               <l>Are a gratuitous emblazonry </l>
               <l>That mocks the recreant age ‘we’ live in, then </l>
               <l>Be Folly and False-seeming free to affect </l>
               <l>Whatever formal gait of discipline </l>
               <l>Shall raise them highest in their own esteem— </l>
               <l>Let them parade among the Schools at will, </l>
               <l>But spare the House of God. Was ever known </l>
               <l>The witless shepherd who persists to drive </l>
               <l>A flock that thirsts not to a pool disliked? </l>
               <l>A weight must surely hang on days begun </l>
               <l>And ended with such mockery. Be wise, </l>
               <l>Ye Presidents and Deans, and, till the spirit </l>
               <l>Of ancient times revive, and youth be trained </l>
               <l>At home in pious service, to your bells </l>
               <l>Give seasonable rest, for 'tis a sound </l>
               <l>Hollow as ever vexed the tranquil air; </l>
               <l>And your officious doings bring disgrace </l>
               <l>On the plain steeples of our English Church, </l>
               <l>Whose worship, 'mid remotest village trees, </l>
               <l>Suffers for this. Even Science, too, at hand </l>
               <l>In daily sight of this irreverence, </l>
               <l>Is smitten thence with an unnatural taint, </l>
               <l>Loses her just authority, falls beneath </l>
               <l>Collateral suspicion, else unknown. </l>
               <l>This truth escaped me not, and I confess, </l>
               <l>That having 'mid my native hills given loose </l>
               <l>To a schoolboy's vision, I had raised a pile </l>
               <l>Upon the basis of the coming time, </l>
               <l>That fell in ruins round me. Oh, what joy </l>
               <l>To see a sanctuary for our country's youth </l>
               <l>Informed with such a spirit as might be </l>
               <l>Its own protection; a primeval grove, </l>
               <l>Where, though the shades with cheerfulness were filled, </l>
               <l>Nor indigent of songs warbled from crowds </l>
               <l>In under-coverts, yet the countenance </l>
               <l>Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe; </l>
               <l>A habitation sober and demure </l>
               <l>For ruminating creatures; a domain </l>
               <l>For quiet things to wander in; a haunt </l>
               <l>In which the heron should delight to feed </l>
               <l>By the shy rivers, and the pelican </l>
               <l>Upon the cypress spire in lonely thought </l>
               <l>Might sit and sun himself.—Alas! Alas! </l>
               <l>In vain for such solemnity I looked; </l>
               <l>Mine eyes were crossed by butterflies, ears vexed </l>
               <l>By chattering popinjays; the inner heart </l>
               <l>Seemed trivial, and the impresses without </l>
               <l>Of a too gaudy region. </l>
               <l>                        Different sight </l>
               <l>Those venerable Doctors saw of old, </l>
               <l>When all who dwelt within these famous walls </l>
               <l>Led in abstemiousness a studious life; </l>
               <l>When, in forlorn and naked chambers cooped </l>
               <l>And crowded, o'er the ponderous books they hung </l>
               <l>Like caterpillars eating out their way </l>
               <l>In silence, or with keen devouring noise </l>
               <l>Not to be tracked or fathered. Princes then </l>
               <l>At matins froze, and couched at curfew-time, </l>
               <l>Trained up through piety and zeal to prize </l>
               <l>Spare diet, patient labour, and plain weeds. </l>

               <l>Sounding through Christian lands her trumpet, roused </l>

               <l>Of ragged villages and crazy huts, </l>

               <l>Crying, “An obolus, a penny give </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>BRIGHT was the summer's noon when quickening steps </l>
               <l>Followed each other till a dreary moor </l>
               <l>Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top </l>
               <l>Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge, </l>
               <l>I overlooked the bed of Windermere, </l>
               <l>Like a vast river, stretching in the sun. </l>
               <l>With exultation, at my feet I saw </l>
               <l>Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays, </l>
               <l>A universe of Nature's fairest forms </l>
               <l>Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst, </l>
               <l>Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay. </l>
               <l>I bounded down the hill shouting amain </l>
               <l>For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks </l>
               <l>Replied, and when the Charon of the flood </l>
               <l>Had staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier, </l>
               <l>I did not step into the well-known boat </l>
               <l>Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed </l>
               <l>Up the familiar hill I took my way </l>
               <l>Towards that sweet Valley where I had been reared; </l>
               <l>'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round </l>
               <l>I saw the snow-white church upon her hill </l>
               <l>Sit like a throned Lady, sending out </l>
               <l>A gracious look all over her domain. </l>
               <l>Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town; </l>
               <l>With eager footsteps I advance and reach </l>
               <l>The cottage threshold where my journey closed. </l>
               <l>Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps, </l>
               <l>From my old Dame, so kind and motherly, </l>
               <l>While she perused me with a parent's pride. </l>
               <l>The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew </l>
               <l>Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heart </l>
               <l>Can beat never will I forget thy name. </l>
               <l>Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest </l>
               <l>After thy innocent and busy stir </l>
               <l>In narrow cares, thy little daily growth </l>
               <l>Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years, </l>
               <l>And more than eighty, of untroubled life; </l>
               <l>Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood </l>
               <l>Honoured with little less than filial love. </l>
               <l>What joy was mine to see thee once again, </l>
               <l>Thee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things </l>
               <l>About its narrow precincts all beloved, </l>
               <l>And many of them seeming yet my own! </l>
               <l>Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts </l>
               <l>Have felt, and every man alive can guess? </l>
               <l>The rooms, the court, the garden were not left </l>
               <l>Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat </l>
               <l>Round the stone table under the dark pine, </l>
               <l>Friendly to studious or to festive hours; </l>
               <l>Nor that unruly child of mountain birth, </l>
               <l>The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed </l>
               <l>Within our garden, found himself at once, </l>
               <l>As if by trick insidious and unkind, </l>
               <l>Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down </l>
               <l>(Without an effort and without a will) </l>
               <l>A channel paved by man's officious care. </l>
               <l>I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again, </l>
               <l>And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts, </l>
               <l>“Ha,” quoth I, “pretty prisoner, are you there!” </l>
               <l>Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered, </l>
               <l>“An emblem here behold of thy own life; </l>
               <l>In its late course of even days with all </l>
               <l>Their smooth enthralment;” but the heart was full, </l>
               <l>Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame </l>
               <l>Walked proudly at my side: she guided me; </l>
               <l>I willing, nay—nay, wishing to be led. </l>
               <l>—The face of every neighbour whom I met </l>
               <l>Was like a volume to me; some were hailed </l>
               <l>Upon the road, some busy at their work, </l>
               <l>Unceremonious greetings interchanged </l>
               <l>With half the length of a long field between. </l>
               <l>Among my schoolfellows I scattered round </l>
               <l>Like recognitions, but with some constraint </l>
               <l>Attended, doubtless, with a little pride, </l>
               <l>But with more shame, for my habiliments, </l>
               <l>The transformation wrought by gay attire. </l>
               <l>Not less delighted did I take my place </l>
               <l>At our domestic table: and, dear Friend! </l>

               <l>By birth and call of nature pre-ordained </l>
               <l>To hunt the badger and unearth the fox </l>
               <l>Among the impervious crags, but having been </l>
               <l>From youth our own adopted, he had passed </l>
               <l>Into a gentler service. And when first </l>
               <l>The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day </l>

               <l>Of poesy, affecting private shades </l>
               <l>Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used </l>

               <l>Much pains and little progress, and at once </l>
               <l>Some lovely Image in the song rose up </l>
               <l>Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea; </l>
               <l>Then have I darted forwards to let loose </l>
               <l>My hand upon his back with stormy joy, </l>
               <l>Caressing him again and yet again. </l>
               <l>And when at evening on the public way </l>
               <l>I sauntered, like a river murmuring </l>

               <l>Regretted!—that word, too, was on my tongue, </l>
               <l>But they were richly laden with all good, </l>
               <l>And cannot be remembered but with thanks </l>
               <l>And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart— </l>
               <l>Those walks in all their freshness now came back </l>
               <l>Like a returning Spring. When first I made </l>
               <l>Once more the circuit of our little lake, </l>
               <l>If ever happiness hath lodged with man, </l>
               <l>That day consummate happiness was mine, </l>
               <l>Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative. </l>
               <l>The sun was set, or setting, when I left </l>
               <l>Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on </l>
               <l>A sober hour, not winning or serene, </l>
               <l>For cold and raw the air was, and untuned: </l>
               <l>But as a face we love is sweetest then </l>
               <l>When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look </l>
               <l>It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart </l>
               <l>Have fulness in herself; even so with me </l>
               <l>It fared that evening. Gently did my soul </l>
               <l>Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood </l>
               <l>Naked, as in the presence of her God. </l>
               <l>While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch </l>
               <l>A heart that had not been disconsolate: </l>
               <l>Strength came where weakness was not known to be, </l>
               <l>At least not felt; and restoration came </l>
               <l>Like an intruder knocking at the door </l>
               <l>Of unacknowledged weariness. I took </l>
               <l>The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself. </l>
               <l>—Of that external scene which round me lay, </l>
               <l>Little, in this abstraction, did I see; </l>
               <l>Remembered less; but I had inward hopes </l>
               <l>And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed, </l>
               <l>Conversed with promises, had glimmering views </l>
               <l>How life pervades the undecaying mind; </l>
               <l>How the immortal soul with God-like power </l>
               <l>Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep </l>
               <l>That time can lay upon her; how on earth, </l>
               <l>Man, if he do but live within the light </l>
               <l>Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad </l>
               <l>His being armed with strength that cannot fail. </l>
               <l>Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love, </l>
               <l>Of innocence, and holiday repose; </l>
               <l>And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir </l>
               <l>Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end </l>
               <l>At last, or glorious, by endurance won. </l>
               <l>Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down </l>
               <l>Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes </l>
               <l>And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread </l>
               <l>With darkness, and before a rippling breeze </l>
               <l>The long lake lengthened out its hoary line, </l>
               <l>And in the sheltered coppice where I sate, </l>
               <l>Around me from among the hazel leaves, </l>
               <l>Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind, </l>
               <l>Came ever and anon a breath-like sound, </l>
               <l>Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog, </l>
               <l>The off and on companion of my walk; </l>
               <l>And such, at times, believing them to be, </l>
               <l>I turned my head to look if he were there; </l>
               <l>Then into solemn thought I passed once more. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  A freshness also found I at this time </l>

               <l>The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise </l>
               <l>Changed like a garden in the heat of spring </l>
               <l>After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit </l>
               <l>The things which were the same and yet appeared </l>
               <l>Far otherwise) amid this rural solitude, </l>
               <l>A narrow Vale where each was known to all, </l>
               <l>'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind </l>
               <l>To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook </l>

               <l>Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left </l>
               <l>In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet </l>
               <l>Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down; </l>
               <l>And growing girls whose beauty, filched away </l>
               <l>With all its pleasant promises, was gone </l>
               <l>To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Yes, I had something of a subtler sense, </l>

               <l>Such as a delicate work of humour breeds; </l>

               <l>With clearer knowledge; with another eye </l>
               <l>I saw the quiet woodman in the woods, </l>
               <l>The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight, </l>
               <l>This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame; </l>
               <l>Saw her go forth to church or other work </l>

               <l>Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like), </l>
               <l>A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers </l>

               <l>Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less </l>
               <l>Her clear though shallow stream of piety </l>
               <l>That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course; </l>
               <l>With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read </l>
               <l>Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons, </l>
               <l>And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep </l>
               <l>And made of it a pillow for her head. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Nor less do I remember to have felt, </l>
               <l>Distinctly manifested at this time, </l>

               <l>But now there opened on me other thoughts </l>
               <l>Of change, congratulation or regret, </l>
               <l>A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide; </l>
               <l>The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks, </l>
               <l>The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts— </l>
               <l>White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags, </l>
               <l>Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven, </l>
               <l>Acquaintances of every little child, </l>

               <l>Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way </l>
               <l>In later youth to yearnings of a love </l>

               <l>  As one who hangs down-bending from the side </l>
               <l>Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast </l>
               <l>Of a still water, solacing himself </l>
               <l>With such discoveries as his eye can make </l>
               <l>Beneath him in the bottom of the deep, </l>

               <l>Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld, </l>
               <l>There was an inner falling off—I loved, </l>
               <l>Loved deeply all that had been loved before, </l>
               <l>More deeply even than ever: but a swarm </l>
               <l>Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds </l>
               <l>And feast and dance, and public revelry, </l>
               <l>And sports and games (too grateful in themselves, </l>
               <l>Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe, </l>
               <l>Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh </l>
               <l>Of manliness and freedom) all conspired </l>
               <l>To lure my mind from firm habitual quest </l>
               <l>Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal </l>
               <l>And damp those yearnings which had once been mine— </l>
               <l>A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up </l>
               <l>To his own eager thoughts. It would demand </l>
               <l>Some skill, and longer time than may be spared </l>
               <l>To paint these vanities, and how they wrought </l>
               <l>In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown. </l>
               <l>It seemed the very garments that I wore </l>
               <l>Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream </l>
               <l>Of self-forgetfulness. </l>
               <l>                        Yes, that heartless chase </l>
               <l>Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange </l>
               <l>For books and nature at that early age. </l>
               <l>'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained </l>
               <l>Of character or life; but at that time, </l>
               <l>Of manners put to school I took small note, </l>
               <l>And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere. </l>
               <l>Far better had it been to exalt the mind </l>
               <l>By solitary study, to uphold </l>
               <l>Intense desire through meditative peace; </l>
               <l>And yet, for chastisement of these regrets, </l>
               <l>The memory of one particular hour </l>
               <l>Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng </l>
               <l>Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid, </l>

               <l>The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth, </l>
               <l>With din of instruments and shuffling feet, </l>
               <l>And glancing forms, and tapers glittering, </l>
               <l>And unaimed prattle flying up and down; </l>
               <l>Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there </l>
               <l>Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed, </l>
               <l>Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head, </l>
               <l>And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired, </l>
               <l>The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky </l>
               <l>Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse </l>
               <l>And open field, through which the pathway wound, </l>
               <l>And homeward led my steps. Magnificent </l>
               <l>The morning rose, in memorable pomp, </l>
               <l>Glorious as e'er I had beheld—in front, </l>

               <l>The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds, </l>
               <l>Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light; </l>
               <l>And in the meadows and the lower grounds </l>
               <l>Was all the sweetness of a common dawn— </l>
               <l>Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, </l>
               <l>And labourers going forth to till the fields. </l>
               <l>Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim </l>
               <l>My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows </l>
               <l>Were then made for me; bond unknown to me </l>
               <l>Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly, </l>
               <l>A dedicated Spirit. On I walked </l>

               <l>Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon </l>
               <l>And bore the semblance of another stream </l>
               <l>Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook </l>
               <l>That murmured in the vale. All else was still; </l>
               <l>No living thing appeared in earth or air, </l>
               <l>And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice, </l>
               <l>Sound there was none—but, lo! an uncouth shape, </l>
               <l>Shown by a sudden turning of the road, </l>
               <l>So near that, slipping back into the shade </l>
               <l>Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well, </l>
               <l>Myself unseen. He was of stature tall, </l>
               <l>A span above man's common measure, tall, </l>
               <l>Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man </l>
               <l>Was never seen before by night or day. </l>
               <l>Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth </l>
               <l>Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind, </l>
               <l>A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken </l>
               <l>That he was clothed in military garb, </l>
               <l>Though faded, yet entire. Companionless, </l>
               <l>No dog attending, by no staff sustained, </l>
               <l>He stood, and in his very dress appeared </l>
               <l>A desolation, a simplicity, </l>
               <l>To which the trappings of a gaudy world </l>
               <l>Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long, </l>
               <l>Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain </l>
               <l>Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form </l>
               <l>Kept the same awful steadiness—at his feet </l>
               <l>His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame </l>
               <l>Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length </l>
               <l>Subduing my heart's specious cowardice, </l>
               <l>I left the shady nook where I had stood </l>
               <l>And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place </l>
               <l>He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm </l>
               <l>In measured gesture lifted to his head </l>
               <l>Returned my salutation; then resumed </l>
               <l>His station as before; and when I asked </l>
               <l>His history, the veteran, in reply, </l>
               <l>Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved, </l>
               <l>And with a quiet uncomplaining voice, </l>
               <l>A stately air of mild indifference, </l>
               <l>He told in few plain words a soldier's tale— </l>
               <l>That in the Tropic Islands he had served, </l>
               <l>Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past; </l>
               <l>That on his landing he had been dismissed, </l>
               <l>And now was travelling towards his native home. </l>
               <l>This heard, I said, in pity, “Come with me.” </l>
               <l>He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up </l>
               <l>An oaken staff by me yet unobserved— </l>
               <l>A staff which must have dropped from his slack hand </l>
               <l>And lay till now neglected in the grass. </l>
               <l>Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared </l>
               <l>To travel without pain, and I beheld, </l>
               <l>With an astonishment but ill suppressed, </l>
               <l>His ghostly figure moving at my side; </l>
               <l>Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear </l>
               <l>To turn from present hardships to the past, </l>
               <l>And speak of war, battle, and pestilence, </l>
               <l>Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared, </l>
               <l>On what he might himself have seen or felt. </l>
               <l>He all the while was in demeanour calm, </l>
               <l>Concise in answer; solemn and sublime </l>
               <l>He might have seemed, but that in all he said </l>
               <l>There was a strange half-absence, as of one </l>
               <l>Knowing too well the importance of his theme, </l>
               <l>But feeling it no longer. Our discourse </l>
               <l>Soon ended, and together on we passed </l>
               <l>In silence through a wood gloomy and still. </l>
               <l>Up-turning, then, along an open field, </l>
               <l>We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked, </l>
               <l>And earnestly to charitable care </l>
               <l>Commended him as a poor friendless man, </l>
               <l>Belated and by sickness overcome. </l>
               <l>Assured that now the traveller would repose </l>
               <l>In comfort, I entreated that henceforth </l>
               <l>He would not linger in the public ways, </l>
               <l>But ask for timely furtherance and help </l>
               <l>Such as his state required. At this reproof, </l>
               <l>With the same ghastly mildness in his look, </l>
               <l>He said, “My trust is in the God of Heaven, </l>
               <l>And in the eye of him who passes me!” </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  The cottage door was speedily unbarred, </l>
               <l>And now the soldier touched his hat once more </l>
               <l>With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice, </l>
               <l>Whose tone bespake reviving interests </l>
               <l>Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned </l>
               <l>The farewell blessing of the patient man, </l>
               <l>And so we parted. Back I cast a look, </l>
               <l>And lingered near the door a little space, </l>
               <l>Then sought with quiet heart my distant home. </l>

               <l>WHEN Contemplation, like the night-calm felt </l>
               <l>Through earth and sky, spreads widely, and sends deep </l>
               <l>Into the soul its tranquillising power, </l>
               <l>Even then I sometimes grieve for thee, O Man, </l>
               <l>Earth's paramount Creature! not so much for woes </l>
               <l>That thou endurest; heavy though that weight be, </l>
               <l>Cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine </l>
               <l>Doth melt away; but for those palms achieved </l>
               <l>Through length of time, by patient exercise </l>
               <l>Of study and hard thought; there, there, it is </l>
               <l>That sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto, </l>
               <l>In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked </l>
               <l>Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven </l>
               <l>As her prime teacher, intercourse with man </l>
               <l>Established by the sovereign Intellect, </l>
               <l>Who through that bodily image hath diffused, </l>
               <l>As might appear to the eye of fleeting time, </l>
               <l>A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought, </l>
               <l>For commerce of thy nature with herself, </l>
               <l>Things that aspire to unconquerable life; </l>
               <l>And yet we feel—we cannot choose but feel— </l>
               <l>That they must perish. Tremblings of the heart </l>
               <l>It gives, to think that our immortal being </l>
               <l>No more shall need such garments; and yet man, </l>
               <l>As long as he shall be the child of earth, </l>
               <l>Might almost “weep to have” what he may lose, </l>
               <l>Nor be himself extinguished, but survive, </l>
               <l>Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate. </l>
               <l>A thought is with me sometimes, and I say,— </l>
               <l>Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes </l>
               <l>Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch </l>
               <l>Her pleasant habitations, and dry up </l>
               <l>Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare, </l>
               <l>Yet would the living Presence still subsist </l>
               <l>Victorious, and composure would ensue, </l>
               <l>And kindlings like the morning—presage sure </l>
               <l>Of day returning and of life revived. </l>
               <l>But all the meditations of mankind, </l>
               <l>Yea, all the adamantine holds of truth </l>
               <l>By reason built, or passion, which itself </l>
               <l>Is highest reason in a soul sublime; </l>
               <l>The consecrated works of Bard and Sage, </l>
               <l>Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men, </l>
               <l>Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes; </l>
               <l>Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the Mind </l>
               <l>Some element to stamp her image on </l>
               <l>In nature somewhat nearer to her own? </l>
               <l>Why, gifted with such powers to send abroad </l>
               <l>Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail? </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  One day, when from my lips a like complaint </l>
               <l>Had fallen in presence of a studious friend, </l>
               <l>He with a smile made answer, that in truth </l>
               <l>'Twas going far to seek disquietude; </l>
               <l>But on the front of his reproof confessed </l>
               <l>That he himself had oftentimes given way </l>
               <l>To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told, </l>
               <l>That once in the stillness of a summer's noon, </l>
               <l>While I was seated in a rocky cave </l>
               <l>By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced, </l>
               <l>The famous history of the errant knight </l>
               <l>Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts </l>
               <l>Beset me, and to height unusual rose, </l>
               <l>While listlessly I sate, and, having closed </l>
               <l>The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea. </l>
               <l>On poetry and geometric truth, </l>
               <l>And their high privilege of lasting life, </l>
               <l>From all internal injury exempt, </l>
               <l>I mused; upon these chiefly: and at length, </l>
               <l>My senses yielding to the sultry air, </l>
               <l>Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream. </l>
               <l>I saw before me stretched a boundless plain </l>
               <l>Of sandy wilderness, all black and void, </l>
               <l>And as I looked around, distress and fear </l>
               <l>Came creeping over me, when at my side, </l>
               <l>Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared </l>
               <l>Upon a dromedary, mounted high. </l>
               <l>He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes: </l>
               <l>A lance he bore, and underneath one arm </l>
               <l>A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell </l>
               <l>Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight </l>
               <l>Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide </l>
               <l>Was present, one who with unerring skill </l>
               <l>Would through the desert lead me; and while yet </l>
               <l>I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight </l>
               <l>Which the new-comer carried through the waste </l>
               <l>Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone </l>
               <l>(To give it in the language of the dream) </l>
               <l>Was “Euclid's Elements,” and “This,” said he, </l>
               <l>“Is something of more worth;” and at the word </l>
               <l>Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape, </l>
               <l>In colour so resplendent, with command </l>
               <l>That I should hold it to my ear. I did so, </l>
               <l>And heard that instant in an unknown tongue, </l>
               <l>Which yet I understood, articulate sounds, </l>
               <l>A loud prophetic blast of harmony; </l>
               <l>An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold </l>
               <l>Destruction to the children of the earth </l>
               <l>By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased </l>
               <l>The song, than the Arab with calm look declared </l>
               <l>That all would come to pass of which the voice </l>
               <l>Had given forewarning, and that he himself </l>
               <l>Was going then to bury those two books: </l>
               <l>The one that held acquaintance with the stars, </l>
               <l>And wedded soul to soul in purest bond </l>
               <l>Of reason, undisturbed by space or time; </l>
               <l>The other that was a god, yea many gods, </l>
               <l>Had voices more than all the winds, with power </l>
               <l>To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe, </l>
               <l>Through every clime, the heart of human kind. </l>
               <l>While this was uttering, strange as it may seem, </l>
               <l>I wondered not, although I plainly saw </l>
               <l>The one to be a stone, the other a shell; </l>
               <l>Nor doubted once but that they both were books, </l>
               <l>Having a perfect faith in all that passed. </l>
               <l>Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt </l>
               <l>To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed </l>
               <l>To share his enterprise, he hurried on </l>
               <l>Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen, </l>
               <l>For oftentimes he cast a backward look, </l>
               <l>Grasping his twofold treasure.—Lance in rest, </l>
               <l>He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now </l>
               <l>He, to my fancy, had become the knight </l>
               <l>Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight, </l>
               <l>But was an Arab of the desert too; </l>
               <l>Of these was neither, and was both at once. </l>
               <l>His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed; </l>
               <l>And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes </l>
               <l>Saw, over half the wilderness diffused, </l>
               <l>A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause: </l>
               <l>“It is,” said he, “the waters of the deep </l>
               <l>Gathering upon us;” quickening then the pace </l>
               <l>Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode, </l>
               <l>He left me: I called after him aloud; </l>
               <l>He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge </l>
               <l>Still in his grasp, before me, full in view, </l>
               <l>Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste, </l>
               <l>With the fleet waters of a drowning world </l>
               <l>In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror, </l>
               <l>And saw the sea before me, and the book, </l>
               <l>In which I had been reading, at my side. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Full often, taking from the world of sleep </l>
               <l>This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld, </l>
               <l>This semi-Quixote, I to him have given </l>
               <l>A substance, fancied him a living man, </l>
               <l>A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed </l>
               <l>By love and feeling, and internal thought </l>
               <l>Protracted among endless solitudes; </l>

               <l>Nor have I pitied him; but rather felt </l>

               <l>We might have fed upon a fatter soil </l>
               <l>Of arts and letters—but be that forgiven)— </l>
               <l>A race of real children; not too wise, </l>
               <l>Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh, </l>
               <l>And bandied up and down by love and hate; </l>
               <l>Not unresentful where self-justified; </l>
               <l>Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy; </l>
               <l>Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds; </l>
               <l>Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft </l>
               <l>Bending beneath our life's mysterious weight </l>
               <l>Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not </l>

               <l>Simplicity in habit, truth in speech, </l>

               <l>  Well do I call to mind the very week </l>
               <l>When I was first intrusted to the care </l>
               <l>Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores, </l>
               <l>And brooks were like a dream of novelty </l>
               <l>To my half-infant thoughts; that very week, </l>
               <l>While I was roving up and down alone, </l>
               <l>Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross </l>
               <l>One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears, </l>
               <l>Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake: </l>
               <l>Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom </l>
               <l>Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore </l>
               <l>A heap of garments, as if left by one </l>
               <l>Who might have there been bathing. Long I watched, </l>
               <l>But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake </l>
               <l>Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast, </l>
               <l>And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped </l>
               <l>The breathless stillness. The succeeding day, </l>
               <l>Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale </l>
               <l>Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked </l>
               <l>In passive expectation from the shore, </l>
               <l>While from a boat others hung o'er the deep, </l>
               <l>Sounding with grappling irons and long poles. </l>

               <l>In spite of all temptation, we preserved </l>

               <l>Approachable, admitting fellowship </l>
               <l>Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now, </l>
               <l>Though not familiarly, my mind put on, </l>

               <l>Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse </l>
               <l>Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms </l>
               <l>Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out </l>

               <l>The self-created sustenance of a mind </l>
               <l>Debarred from Nature's living images, </l>
               <l>Compelled to be a life unto herself, </l>
               <l>And unrelentingly possessed by thirst </l>
               <l>Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone, </l>
               <l>Ah! surely not in singleness of heart </l>
               <l>Should I have seen the light of evening fade </l>
               <l>From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met, </l>
               <l>Even at that early time, needs must I trust </l>
               <l>In the belief, that my maturer age, </l>
               <l>My calmer habits, and more steady voice, </l>
               <l>Would with an influence benign have soothed, </l>
               <l>Or chased away, the airy wretchedness </l>
               <l>That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod </l>
               <l>A march of glory, which doth put to shame </l>
               <l>These vain regrets; health suffers in thee, else </l>
               <l>Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought </l>

               <l>From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced </l>

               <l>Spread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring </l>
               <l>Hath left no corner of the land untouched; </l>

               <l>The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once, </l>
               <l>Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw </l>
               <l>Dances of liberty, and, in late hours </l>
               <l>Of darkness, dances in the open air </l>

               <l>Upon the bosom of the gentle Saone </l>
               <l>We glided forward with the flowing stream. </l>
               <l>Swift Rhone! thou wert the ‘wings’ on which we cut </l>
               <l>A winding passage with majestic ease </l>
               <l>Between thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show </l>
               <l>Those woods and farms and orchards did present, </l>
               <l>And single cottages and lurking towns, </l>
               <l>Reach after reach, succession without end </l>
               <l>Of deep and stately vales! A lonely pair </l>
               <l>Of strangers, till day closed, we sailed along </l>
               <l>Clustered together with a merry crowd </l>
               <l>Of those emancipated, a blithe host </l>
               <l>Of travellers, chiefly delegates, returning </l>
               <l>From the great spousals newly solemnised </l>
               <l>At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven. </l>
               <l>Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees; </l>
               <l>Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy, </l>
               <l>And with their swords flourished as if to fight </l>
               <l>The saucy air. In this proud company </l>
               <l>We landed—took with them our evening meal, </l>
               <l>Guests welcome almost as the angels were </l>
               <l>To Abraham of old. The supper done, </l>
               <l>With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts </l>
               <l>We rose at signal given, and formed a ring </l>
               <l>And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board; </l>
               <l>All hearts were open, every tongue was loud </l>
               <l>With amity and glee; we bore a name </l>
               <l>Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen, </l>
               <l>And hospitably did they give us hail, </l>
               <l>As their forerunners in a glorious course; </l>
               <l>And round and round the board we danced again. </l>
               <l>With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed </l>
               <l>At early dawn. The monastery bells </l>
               <l>Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears; </l>
               <l>The rapid river flowing without noise, </l>
               <l>And each uprising or receding spire </l>
               <l>Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals </l>
               <l>Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew </l>
               <l>By whom we were encompassed. Taking leave </l>
               <l>Of this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side, </l>
               <l>Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued </l>
               <l>Our journey, and ere twice the sun had set </l>
               <l>Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there </l>
               <l>Rested within an awful ‘solitude’: </l>
               <l>Yes, for even then no other than a place </l>
               <l>Of soul-affecting ‘solitude’ appeared </l>
               <l>That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen, </l>
               <l>As toward the sacred mansion we advanced, </l>
               <l>Arms flashing, and a military glare </l>
               <l>Of riotous men commissioned to expel </l>
               <l>The blameless inmates, and belike subvert </l>
               <l>That frame of social being, which so long </l>
               <l>Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things </l>
               <l>In silence visible and perpetual calm. </l>
               <l>—“Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!”—The voice </l>
               <l>Was Nature's, uttered from her Alpine throne; </l>
               <l>I heard it then and seem to hear it now— </l>
               <l>“Your impious work forbear, perish what may, </l>
               <l>Let this one temple last, be this one spot </l>
               <l>Of earth devoted to eternity!” </l>
               <l>She ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno's pines </l>
               <l>Waved their dark tops, not silent as they waved, </l>
               <l>And while below, along their several beds, </l>
               <l>Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death, </l>
               <l>Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart </l>
               <l>Responded; “Honour to the patriot's zeal! </l>
               <l>Glory and hope to new-born Liberty! </l>
               <l>Hail to the mighty projects of the time! </l>
               <l>Discerning sword that Justice wields, do thou </l>
               <l>Go forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires, </l>
               <l>Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend, </l>
               <l>Fanned by the breath of angry Providence. </l>
               <l>But oh! if Past and Future be the wings </l>
               <l>On whose support harmoniously conjoined </l>
               <l>Moves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare </l>
               <l>These courts of mystery, where a step advanced </l>
               <l>Between the portals of the shadowy rocks </l>
               <l>Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities, </l>
               <l>For penitential tears and trembling hopes </l>
               <l>Exchanged—to equalise in God's pure sight </l>
               <l>Monarch and peasant: be the house redeemed </l>
               <l>With its unworldly votaries, for the sake </l>
               <l>Of conquest over sense, hourly achieved </l>
               <l>Through faith and meditative reason, resting </l>
               <l>Upon the word of heaven-imparted truth, </l>
               <l>Calmly triumphant; and for humbler claim </l>
               <l>Of that imaginative impulse sent </l>
               <l>From these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs, </l>
               <l>The untransmuted shapes of many worlds, </l>
               <l>Cerulean ether's pure inhabitants, </l>
               <l>These forests unapproachable by death, </l>
               <l>That shall endure as long as man endures, </l>
               <l>To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel, </l>
               <l>To struggle, to be lost within himself </l>
               <l>In trepidation, from the blank abyss </l>
               <l>To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled.” </l>
               <l>Not seldom since that moment have I wished </l>
               <l>That thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calm </l>
               <l>Hadst shared, when, from profane regards apart, </l>

               <l>Lessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain </l>
               <l>And universal reason of mankind, </l>
               <l>The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side </l>
               <l>Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone </l>
               <l>Each with his humour, could we fail to abound </l>
               <l>In dreams and fictions, pensively composed: </l>
               <l>Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake, </l>
               <l>And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath, </l>
               <l>And sober posies of funereal flowers, </l>
               <l>Gathered among those solitudes sublime </l>
               <l>From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow, </l>

               <l>  Yet still in me with those soft luxuries </l>
               <l>Mixed something of stern mood, an underthirst </l>
               <l>Of vigour seldom utterly allayed: </l>
               <l>And from that source how different a sadness </l>

               <l>When from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb </l>
               <l>Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road, </l>
               <l>Following a band of muleteers, we reached </l>
               <l>A halting-place, where all together took </l>
               <l>Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide, </l>
               <l>Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered, </l>
               <l>Then paced the beaten downward way that led </l>
               <l>Right to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off; </l>
               <l>The only track now visible was one </l>
               <l>That from the torrent's further brink held forth </l>
               <l>Conspicuous invitation to ascend </l>
               <l>A lofty mountain. After brief delay </l>
               <l>Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took, </l>
               <l>And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears </l>
               <l>Intruded, for we failed to overtake </l>
               <l>Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance, </l>
               <l>While every moment added doubt to doubt, </l>
               <l>A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned </l>
               <l>That to the spot which had perplexed us first </l>
               <l>We must descend, and there should find the road, </l>
               <l>Which in the stony channel of the stream </l>
               <l>Lay a few steps, and then along its banks; </l>
               <l>And, that our future course, all plain to sight, </l>
               <l>Was downwards, with the current of that stream. </l>
               <l>Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear, </l>
               <l>For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds, </l>
               <l>We questioned him again, and yet again; </l>
               <l>But every word that from the peasant's lips </l>
               <l>Came in reply, translated by our feelings, </l>
               <l>Ended in this,—'that we had crossed the Alps'. </l>

               <l>The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts </l>
               <l>On thy departure to a foreign land </l>
               <l>Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work. </l>
               <l>Through the whole summer have I been at rest, </l>
               <l>Partly from voluntary holiday, </l>
               <l>And part through outward hindrance. But I heard, </l>
               <l>After the hour of sunset yester-even, </l>
               <l>Sitting within doors between light and dark, </l>
               <l>A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near </l>
               <l>My threshold,—minstrels from the distant woods </l>
               <l>Sent in on Winter's service, to announce, </l>
               <l>With preparation artful and benign, </l>
               <l>That the rough lord had left the surly North </l>
               <l>On his accustomed journey. The delight, </l>
               <l>Due to this timely notice, unawares </l>
               <l>Smote me, and, listening, I in whispers said, </l>
               <l>“Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be </l>
               <l>Associates, and, unscared by blustering winds, </l>
               <l>Will chant together.” Thereafter, as the shades </l>
               <l>Of twilight deepened, going forth, I spied </l>
               <l>A glow-worm underneath a dusky plume </l>
               <l>Or canopy of yet unwithered fern, </l>
               <l>Clear-shining, like a hermit's taper seen </l>
               <l>Through a thick forest. Silence touched me here </l>
               <l>No less than sound had done before; the child </l>
               <l>Of Summer, lingering, shining, by herself, </l>
               <l>The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills, </l>
               <l>Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir </l>
               <l>Of Winter that had warbled at my door, </l>
               <l>And the whole year breathed tenderness and love. </l>

               <l>  The last night's genial feeling overflowed </l>

               <l>Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft, </l>

               <l>In look and air, from that new region brought, </l>

               <l>That answers unexpectedly awry, </l>

               <l>Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace </l>
               <l>Upon the spot where she was born and reared; </l>
               <l>Without contamination doth she live </l>
               <l>In quietness, without anxiety: </l>
               <l>Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earth </l>
               <l>Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb </l>
               <l>That, thither driven from some unsheltered place, </l>
               <l>Rests underneath the little rock-like pile </l>
               <l>When storms are raging. Happy are they both— </l>
               <l>Mother and child!—These feelings, in themselves </l>
               <l>Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think </l>
               <l>On those ingenuous moments of our youth </l>
               <l>Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes </l>
               <l>And sorrows of the world. Those simple days </l>
               <l>Are now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes, </l>
               <l>Which yet survive in memory, appears </l>
               <l>One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy, </l>
               <l>A sportive infant, who, for six months' space, </l>
               <l>Not more, had been of age to deal about </l>
               <l>Articulate prattle—Child as beautiful </l>
               <l>As ever clung around a mother's neck, </l>
               <l>Or father fondly gazed upon with pride. </l>
               <l>There, too, conspicuous for stature tall </l>
               <l>And large dark eyes, beside her infant stood </l>
               <l>The mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused, </l>
               <l>False tints too well accorded with the glare </l>
               <l>From play-house lustres thrown without reserve </l>
               <l>On every object near. The Boy had been </l>
               <l>The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on </l>
               <l>In whatsoever place, but seemed in this </l>
               <l>A sort of alien scattered from the clouds. </l>
               <l>Of lusty vigour, more than infantine </l>
               <l>He was in limb, in cheek a summer rose </l>
               <l>Just three parts blown—a cottage-child—if e'er, </l>
               <l>By cottage-door on breezy mountain-side, </l>
               <l>Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe </l>
               <l>By Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board </l>
               <l>Decked with refreshments had this child been placed </l>
               <l>‘His’ little stage in the vast theatre, </l>
               <l>And there he sate, surrounded with a throng </l>
               <l>Of chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men </l>
               <l>And shameless women, treated and caressed; </l>
               <l>Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played, </l>
               <l>While oaths and laughter and indecent speech </l>
               <l>Were rife about him as the songs of birds </l>
               <l>Contending after showers. The mother now </l>
               <l>Is fading out of memory, but I see </l>
               <l>The lovely Boy as I beheld him then </l>
               <l>Among the wretched and the falsely gay, </l>
               <l>Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged </l>
               <l>Amid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells </l>
               <l>Muttered on black and spiteful instigation </l>
               <l>Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths. </l>
               <l>Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer </l>
               <l>Have been preferred, that this fair creature, checked </l>
               <l>By special privilege of Nature's love, </l>
               <l>Should in his childhood be detained for ever! </l>
               <l>But with its universal freight the tide </l>
               <l>Hath rolled along, and this bright innocent, </l>
               <l>Mary! may now have lived till he could look </l>
               <l>With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps, </l>
               <l>Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed. </l>

               <l>Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills, </l>
               <l>I heard, and for the first time in my life, </l>
               <l>The voice of woman utter blasphemy— </l>
               <l>Saw woman as she is, to open shame </l>
               <l>Abandoned, and the pride of public vice; </l>
               <l>I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at once </l>
               <l>Thrown in that from humanity divorced </l>
               <l>Humanity, splitting the race of man </l>
               <l>In twain, yet leaving the same outward form. </l>
               <l>Distress of mind ensued upon the sight, </l>
               <l>And ardent meditation. Later years </l>
               <l>Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness, </l>
               <l>Feelings of pure commiseration, grief </l>

               <l>How casual incidents of real life, </l>
               <l>Observed where pastime only had been sought, </l>
               <l>Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events </l>
               <l>And measured passions of the stage, albeit </l>
               <l>By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power. </l>
               <l>Yet was the theatre my dear delight; </l>
               <l>The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls, </l>
               <l>And all the mean upholstery of the place, </l>
               <l>Wanted not animation, when the tide </l>

               <l>Of thick entangled forest, like the moon </l>
               <l>Opening the clouds; or sovereign king, announced </l>
               <l>With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state </l>
               <l>Of the world's greatness, winding round with train </l>
               <l>Of courtiers, banners, and a length of guards; </l>
               <l>Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling </l>
               <l>His slender manacles; or romping girl </l>
               <l>Bounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire, </l>
               <l>A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed up </l>
               <l>In all the tatters of infirmity </l>
               <l>All loosely put together, hobbled in, </l>
               <l>Stumping upon a cane with which he smites, </l>

               <l>Of one so overloaded with his years. </l>
               <l>But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace, </l>
               <l>The antics striving to outstrip each other, </l>
               <l>Were all received, the least of them not lost, </l>
               <l>With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night, </l>
               <l>Between the show, and many-headed mass </l>
               <l>Of the spectators, and each several nook </l>
               <l>Filled with its fray or brawl, how eagerly </l>
               <l>And with what flashes, as it were, the mind </l>
               <l>Turned this way—that way! sportive and alert </l>
               <l>And watchful, as a kitten when at play, </l>
               <l>While winds are eddying round her, among straws </l>
               <l>And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet! </l>
               <l>Romantic almost, looked at through a space, </l>

               <l>Enjoyment haply handed down from times </l>
               <l>When at a country-playhouse, some rude barn </l>

               <l>In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse </l>
               <l>Of daylight, the bare thought of where I was </l>
               <l>Gladdened me more than if I had been led </l>
               <l>Into a dazzling cavern of romance, </l>

               <l>The views and aspirations of the soul </l>
               <l>To majesty. Like virtue have the forms </l>
               <l>Perennial of the ancient hills; nor less </l>
               <l>The changeful language of their countenances </l>
               <l>Quickens the slumbering mind, and aids the thoughts, </l>
               <l>However multitudinous, to move </l>
               <l>With order and relation. This, if still, </l>
               <l>As hitherto, in freedom I may speak, </l>
               <l>Not violating any just restraint, </l>
               <l>As may be hoped, of real modesty,— </l>
               <l>This did I feel, in London's vast domain. </l>
               <l>The Spirit of Nature was upon me there; </l>
               <l>The soul of Beauty and enduring Life </l>
               <l>Vouchsafed her inspiration, and diffused, </l>
               <l>Through meagre lines and colours, and the press </l>
               <l>Of self-destroying, transitory things, </l>
               <l>Composure, and ennobling Harmony. </l>

               <l>WHAT sounds are those, Helvellyn, that are heard </l>
               <l>Up to thy summit, through the depth of air </l>
               <l>Ascending, as if distance had the power </l>
               <l>To make the sounds more audible? What crowd </l>
               <l>Covers, or sprinkles o'er, yon village green? </l>
               <l>Crowd seems it, solitary hill! to thee, </l>
               <l>Though but a little family of men, </l>
               <l>Shepherds and tillers of the ground—betimes </l>
               <l>Assembled with their children and their wives, </l>
               <l>And here and there a stranger interspersed. </l>
               <l>They hold a rustic fair—a festival, </l>
               <l>Such as, on this side now, and now on that, </l>
               <l>Repeated through his tributary vales, </l>
               <l>Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest, </l>
               <l>Sees annually, if clouds towards either ocean </l>
               <l>Blown from their favourite resting-place, or mists </l>
               <l>Dissolved, have left him an unshrouded head. </l>
               <l>Delightful day it is for all who dwell </l>
               <l>In this secluded glen, and eagerly </l>
               <l>They give it welcome. Long ere heat of noon, </l>
               <l>From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheep </l>
               <l>Are penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun. </l>
               <l>The heifer lows, uneasy at the voice </l>
               <l>Of a new master; bleat the flocks aloud. </l>
               <l>Booths are there none; a stall or two is here; </l>
               <l>A lame man or a blind, the one to beg, </l>
               <l>The other to make music; hither, too, </l>
               <l>From far, with basket, slung upon her arm, </l>
               <l>Of hawker's wares—books, pictures, combs, and pins— </l>
               <l>Some aged woman finds her way again, </l>
               <l>Year after year, a punctual visitant! </l>
               <l>There also stands a speech-maker by rote, </l>
               <l>Pulling the strings of his boxed raree-show; </l>
               <l>And in the lapse of many years may come </l>
               <l>Prouder itinerant, mountebank, or he </l>
               <l>Whose wonders in a covered wain lie hid. </l>
               <l>But one there is, the loveliest of them all, </l>
               <l>Some sweet lass of the valley, looking out </l>
               <l>For gains, and who that sees her would not buy? </l>
               <l>Fruits of her father's orchard are her wares, </l>
               <l>And with the ruddy produce she walks round </l>
               <l>Among the crowd, half pleased with, half ashamed </l>
               <l>Of, her new office, blushing restlessly. </l>
               <l>The children now are rich, for the old to-day </l>
               <l>Are generous as the young; and, if content </l>
               <l>With looking on, some ancient wedded pair </l>
               <l>Sit in the shade together; while they gaze, </l>
               <l>“A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow, </l>
               <l>The days departed start again to life, </l>
               <l>And all the scenes of childhood reappear, </l>
               <l>Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sun </l>
               <l>To him who slept at noon and wakes at eve.” </l>
               <l>Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail, </l>
               <l>Spreading from young to old, from old to young, </l>
               <l>And no one seems to want his share.—Immense </l>
               <l>Is the recess, the circumambient world </l>
               <l>Magnificent, by which they are embraced: </l>
               <l>They move about upon the soft green turf: </l>
               <l>How little they, they and their doings, seem, </l>
               <l>And all that they can further or obstruct! </l>
               <l>Through utter weakness pitiably dear, </l>
               <l>As tender infants are: and yet how great! </l>
               <l>For all things serve them: them the morning light </l>
               <l>Loves, as it glistens on the silent rocks; </l>
               <l>And them the silent rocks, which now from high </l>
               <l>Look down upon them; the reposing clouds; </l>
               <l>The wild brooks prattling from invisible haunts; </l>
               <l>And old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir </l>
               <l>Which animates this day their calm abode. </l>

               <l>  With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel, </l>

               <l>Of men and things, what benefit I owed </l>
               <l>To thee, and those domains of rural peace, </l>
               <l>Where to the sense of beauty first my heart </l>
               <l>Was opened; tract more exquisitely fair </l>
               <l>Than that famed paradise of ten thousand trees, </l>
               <l>Or Gehol's matchless gardens, for delight </l>

               <l>(Beyond that mighty wall, not fabulous, </l>

               <l>Into each other their obsequious hues, </l>
               <l>Vanished and vanishing in subtle chase, </l>
               <l>Too fine to be pursued; or standing forth </l>

               <l>  Yea, when a glimpse of those imperial bowers </l>
               <l>Would to a child be transport over-great, </l>
               <l>When but a half-hour's roam through such a place </l>

               <l>And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first; </l>
               <l>Not such as Saturn ruled 'mid Latian wilds, </l>

               <l>Left, even to us toiling in this late day, </l>
               <l>A bright tradition of the golden age; </l>
               <l>Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses </l>
               <l>Sequestered, handed down among themselves </l>
               <l>Felicity, in Grecian song renowned; </l>
               <l>Nor such as—when an adverse fate had driven, </l>
               <l>From house and home, the courtly band whose fortunes </l>
               <l>Entered, with Shakspeare's genius, the wild woods </l>
               <l>Of Arden—amid sunshine or in shade </l>

               <l>Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King; </l>
               <l>Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is, </l>
               <l>That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen) </l>
               <l>Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far </l>
               <l>Their May-bush, and along the streets in flocks </l>
               <l>Parading with a song of taunting rhymes, </l>
               <l>Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors; </l>
               <l>Had also heard, from those who yet remembered, </l>
               <l>Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that decked </l>
               <l>Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; and of youths, </l>
               <l>Each with his maid, before the sun was up, </l>
               <l>By annual custom, issuing forth in troops, </l>
               <l>To drink the waters of some sainted well, </l>
               <l>And hang it round with garlands. Love survives; </l>
               <l>But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow: </l>
               <l>The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped </l>
               <l>These lighter graces; and the rural ways </l>
               <l>And manners which my childhood looked upon </l>
               <l>Were the unluxuriant produce of a life </l>
               <l>Intent on little but substantial needs, </l>
               <l>Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt. </l>
               <l>But images of danger and distress, </l>
               <l>Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms; </l>

               <l>Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales </l>

               <l>Immutable, and everflowing streams, </l>

               <l>Though under skies less generous, less serene: </l>

               <l>A pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse </l>
               <l>Of level pasture, islanded with groves </l>
               <l>And banked with woody risings; but the Plain </l>
               <l>Endless, here opening widely out, and there </l>
               <l>Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn </l>
               <l>And intricate recesses, creek or bay </l>
               <l>Sheltered within a shelter, where at large </l>

               <l>Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides </l>
               <l>All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear </l>
               <l>His flageolet to liquid notes of love </l>
               <l>Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far. </l>

               <l>In unlaborious pleasure, with no task </l>
               <l>More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl </l>
               <l>For spring or fountain, which the traveller finds, </l>
               <l>When through the region he pursues at will </l>
               <l>His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life </l>

               <l>And northwards, from beneath the mountainous verge </l>
               <l>Of the Hercynian forest. Yet, hail to you </l>
               <l>Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales, </l>
               <l>Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice, </l>
               <l>Powers of my native region! Ye that seize </l>
               <l>The heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streams </l>
               <l>Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds, </l>
               <l>That howl so dismally for him who treads </l>
               <l>Companionless your awful solitudes! </l>
               <l>There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long </l>
               <l>To wait upon the storms: of their approach </l>
               <l>Sagacious, into sheltering coves he drives </l>
               <l>His flock, and thither from the homestead bears </l>
               <l>A toilsome burden up the craggy ways, </l>
               <l>And deals it out, their regular nourishment </l>

               <l>Higher and higher, him his office leads </l>
               <l>To watch their goings, whatsoever track </l>
               <l>The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home </l>
               <l>At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun </l>
               <l>Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat, </l>
               <l>Than he lies down upon some shining rock, </l>
               <l>And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen, </l>
               <l>As is their wont, a pittance from strict time, </l>
               <l>For rest not needed or exchange of love, </l>
               <l>Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet </l>
               <l>Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers </l>
               <l>Of lowly thyme, by Nature's skill enwrought </l>
               <l>In the wild turf: the lingering dews of morn </l>
               <l>Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies, </l>
               <l>His staff protending like a hunter's spear, </l>
               <l>Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag, </l>
               <l>And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams. </l>
               <l>Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy's call, </l>
               <l>Might deign to follow him through what he does </l>
               <l>Or sees in his day's march; himself he feels, </l>
               <l>In those vast regions where his service lies, </l>
               <l>A freeman, wedded to his life of hope </l>
               <l>And hazard, and hard labour interchanged </l>
               <l>With that majestic indolence so dear </l>
               <l>To native man. A rambling schoolboy, thus, </l>
               <l>I felt his presence in his own domain, </l>
               <l>As of a lord and master, or a power, </l>
               <l>Or genius, under Nature, under God, </l>
               <l>Presiding; and severest solitude </l>
               <l>Had more commanding looks when he was there. </l>
               <l>When up the lonely brooks on rainy days </l>
               <l>Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills </l>
               <l>By mists bewildered, suddenly mine eyes </l>
               <l>Have glanced upon him distant a few steps, </l>
               <l>In size a giant, stalking through thick fog, </l>
               <l>His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped </l>
               <l>Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow, </l>
               <l>His form hath flashed upon me, glorified </l>
               <l>By the deep radiance of the setting sun: </l>
               <l>Or him have I descried in distant sky, </l>
               <l>A solitary object and sublime, </l>
               <l>Above all height! like an aerial cross </l>
               <l>Stationed alone upon a spiry rock </l>
               <l>Of the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was man </l>
               <l>Ennobled outwardly before my sight, </l>
               <l>And thus my heart was early introduced </l>
               <l>To an unconscious love and reverence </l>
               <l>Of human nature; hence the human form </l>
               <l>To me became an index of delight, </l>
               <l>Of grace and honour, power and worthiness. </l>
               <l>Meanwhile this creature—spiritual almost </l>
               <l>As those of books, but more exalted far; </l>
               <l>Far more of an imaginative form </l>
               <l>Than the gay Corin of the groves, who lives </l>
               <l>For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour, </l>
               <l>In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst— </l>
               <l>Was, for the purposes of kind, a man </l>
               <l>With the most common; husband, father; learned, </l>
               <l>Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest </l>
               <l>From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear; </l>
               <l>Of this I little saw, cared less for it, </l>
               <l>But something must have felt. </l>
               <l>                               Call ye these appearances— </l>
               <l>Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth, </l>
               <l>This sanctity of Nature given to man— </l>
               <l>A shadow, a delusion, ye who pore </l>
               <l>On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things; </l>
               <l>Whose truth is not a motion or a shape </l>
               <l>Instinct with vital functions, but a block </l>
               <l>Or waxen image which yourselves have made, </l>
               <l>And ye adore! But blessed be the God </l>
               <l>Of Nature and of Man that this was so; </l>
               <l>That men before my inexperienced eyes </l>
               <l>Did first present themselves thus purified, </l>
               <l>Removed, and to a distance that was fit: </l>
               <l>And so we all of us in some degree </l>
               <l>Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led, </l>
               <l>And howsoever; were it otherwise, </l>
               <l>And we found evil fast as we find good </l>
               <l>In our first years, or think that it is found, </l>
               <l>How could the innocent heart bear up and live! </l>
               <l>But doubly fortunate my lot; not here </l>
               <l>Alone, that something of a better life </l>
               <l>Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege </l>
               <l>Of most to move in, but that first I looked </l>
               <l>At Man through objects that were great or fair; </l>
               <l>First communed with him by their help. And thus </l>
               <l>Was founded a sure safeguard and defence </l>
               <l>Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares, </l>
               <l>Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in </l>
               <l>On all sides from the ordinary world </l>
               <l>In which we traffic. Starting from this point </l>
               <l>I had my face turned toward the truth, began </l>
               <l>With an advantage furnished by that kind </l>
               <l>Of prepossession, without which the soul </l>
               <l>Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good, </l>
               <l>No genuine insight ever comes to her. </l>
               <l>From the restraint of over-watchful eyes </l>
               <l>Preserved, I moved about, year after year, </l>
               <l>Happy, and now most thankful that my walk </l>
               <l>Was guarded from too early intercourse </l>
               <l>With the deformities of crowded life, </l>
               <l>And those ensuing laughters and contempts, </l>
               <l>Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think </l>
               <l>With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord, </l>
               <l>Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven, </l>
               <l>Will not permit us; but pursue the mind, </l>
               <l>That to devotion willingly would rise, </l>
               <l>Into the temple and the temple's heart. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me </l>
               <l>Thus early took a place pre-eminent; </l>
               <l>Nature herself was, at this unripe time, </l>
               <l>But secondary to my own pursuits </l>
               <l>And animal activities, and all </l>
               <l>Their trivial pleasures; and when these had drooped </l>
               <l>And gradually expired, and Nature, prized </l>
               <l>For her own sake, became my joy, even then— </l>
               <l>And upwards through late youth, until not less </l>
               <l>Than two-and-twenty summers had been told— </l>
               <l>Was Man in my affections and regards </l>
               <l>Subordinate to her, her visible forms </l>
               <l>And viewless agencies: a passion, she, </l>
               <l>A rapture often, and immediate love </l>
               <l>Ever at hand; he, only a delight </l>
               <l>Occasional, an accidental grace, </l>
               <l>His hour being not yet come. Far less had then </l>
               <l>The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned </l>
               <l>My spirit to that gentleness of love, </l>
               <l>(Though they had long been carefully observed), </l>
               <l>Won from me those minute obeisances </l>
               <l>Of tenderness, which I may number now </l>
               <l>With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these </l>
               <l>The light of beauty did not fall in vain, </l>
               <l>Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  But when that first poetic faculty </l>

               <l>No longer a mute influence of the soul, </l>
               <l>Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest call, </l>
               <l>To try her strength among harmonious words; </l>
               <l>And to book-notions and the rules of art </l>
               <l>Did knowingly conform itself; there came </l>
               <l>Among the simple shapes of human life </l>
               <l>A wilfulness of fancy and conceit; </l>

               <l>These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn, </l>
               <l>They burnished her. From touch of this new power </l>
               <l>Nothing was safe: the elder-tree that grew </l>
               <l>Beside the well-known charnel-house had then </l>
               <l>A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost, </l>
               <l>That took his station there for ornament: </l>
               <l>The dignities of plain occurrence then </l>
               <l>Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point </l>

               <l>Then, if a widow, staggering with the blow </l>

               <l>To the cold grave in which her husband slept, </l>

               <l>Or half-insensate impotence of mind, </l>
               <l>The fact was caught at greedily, and there </l>

               <l>Instinctively to human passions, then </l>

               <l>And lovely region, I had forms distinct </l>
               <l>To steady me: each airy thought revolved </l>
               <l>Round a substantial centre, which at once </l>
               <l>Incited it to motion, and controlled. </l>

               <l>                A grove there is whose boughs </l>

               <l>With length of shade so thick, that whoso glides </l>
               <l>Along the line of low-roofed water, moves </l>
               <l>As in a cloister. Once—while, in that shade </l>
               <l>Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light </l>
               <l>Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed </l>
               <l>In silent beauty on the naked ridge </l>

               <l>And all enjoyment which the summer sun </l>
               <l>Sheds round the steps of those who meet the day </l>
               <l>With motion constant as his own, I went </l>
               <l>Prepared to sojourn in a pleasant town, </l>
               <l>Washed by the current of the stately Loire. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Through Paris lay my readiest course, and there </l>
               <l>Sojourning a few days, I visited </l>
               <l>In haste, each spot of old or recent fame, </l>
               <l>The latter chiefly, from the field of Mars </l>
               <l>Down to the suburbs of St. Antony, </l>
               <l>And from Mont Martre southward to the Dome </l>
               <l>Of Genevieve. In both her clamorous Halls, </l>
               <l>The National Synod and the Jacobins, </l>
               <l>I saw the Revolutionary Power </l>
               <l>Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms; </l>
               <l>The Arcades I traversed, in the Palace huge </l>
               <l>Of Orleans; coasted round and round the line </l>
               <l>Of Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop, </l>
               <l>Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk </l>
               <l>Of all who had a purpose, or had not; </l>
               <l>I stared and listened, with a stranger's ears, </l>
               <l>To Hawkers and Haranguers, hubbub wild! </l>
               <l>And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes, </l>
               <l>In knots, or pairs, or single. Not a look </l>
               <l>Hope takes, or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear, </l>
               <l>But seemed there present; and I scanned them all, </l>
               <l>Watched every gesture uncontrollable, </l>
               <l>Of anger, and vexation, and despite, </l>
               <l>All side by side, and struggling face to face, </l>
               <l>With gaiety and dissolute idleness. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust </l>

               <l>And from the rubbish gathered up a stone, </l>
               <l>And pocketed the relic, in the guise </l>
               <l>Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth, </l>
               <l>I looked for something that I could not find, </l>
               <l>Affecting more emotion than I felt; </l>
               <l>For 'tis most certain, that these various sights, </l>
               <l>However potent their first shock, with me </l>
               <l>Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains </l>
               <l>Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun, </l>
               <l>A beauty exquisitely wrought, with hair </l>
               <l>Dishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheek </l>

               <l>I hasten; there, by novelties in speech, </l>
               <l>Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks, </l>
               <l>And all the attire of ordinary life, </l>
               <l>Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused, </l>
               <l>I stood 'mid those concussions, unconcerned, </l>
               <l>Tranquil almost, and careless as a flower </l>
               <l>Glassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrub </l>

               <l>While every bush and tree, the country through, </l>
               <l>Is shaking to the roots: indifference this </l>
               <l>Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared </l>
               <l>With needful knowledge, had abruptly passed </l>
               <l>Into a theatre, whose stage was filled </l>
               <l>And busy with an action far advanced. </l>
               <l>Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read </l>
               <l>With care, the master pamphlets of the day; </l>
               <l>Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild </l>
               <l>Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk </l>
               <l>And public news; but having never seen </l>
               <l>A chronicle that might suffice to show </l>
               <l>Whence the main organs of the public power </l>
               <l>Had sprung, their transmigrations, when and how </l>
               <l>Accomplished, giving thus unto events </l>
               <l>A form and body; all things were to me </l>
               <l>Loose and disjointed, and the affections left </l>
               <l>Without a vital interest. At that time, </l>
               <l>Moreover, the first storm was overblown, </l>
               <l>And the strong hand of outward violence </l>
               <l>Locked up in quiet. For myself, I fear </l>

               <l>Whom, in the city, privilege of birth </l>
               <l>Sequestered from the rest, societies </l>
               <l>Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed; </l>
               <l>Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourse </l>
               <l>Of good and evil of the time was shunned </l>
               <l>With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon </l>
               <l>Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew </l>
               <l>Into a noisier world, and thus ere long </l>
               <l>Became a patriot; and my heart was all </l>
               <l>Given to the people, and my love was theirs. </l>

               <l>  A band of military Officers, </l>
               <l>Then stationed in the city, were the chief </l>
               <l>Of my associates: some of these wore swords </l>
               <l>That had been seasoned in the wars, and all </l>
               <l>Were men well-born; the chivalry of France. </l>
               <l>In age and temper differing, they had yet </l>
               <l>One spirit ruling in each heart; alike </l>
               <l>(Save only one, hereafter to be named) </l>
               <l>Were bent upon undoing what was done: </l>
               <l>This was their rest and only hope; therewith </l>
               <l>No fear had they of bad becoming worse, </l>
               <l>For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred, </l>

               <l>In anything, save only as the act </l>
               <l>Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years, </l>
               <l>Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile </l>
               <l>He had sate lord in many tender hearts; </l>
               <l>Though heedless of such honours now, and changed: </l>
               <l>His temper was quite mastered by the times, </l>
               <l>And they had blighted him, had eaten away </l>
               <l>The beauty of his person, doing wrong </l>
               <l>Alike to body and to mind: his port, </l>
               <l>Which once had been erect and open, now </l>
               <l>Was stooping and contracted, and a face, </l>
               <l>Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts </l>
               <l>Of symmetry and light and bloom, expressed, </l>
               <l>As much as any that was ever seen, </l>
               <l>A ravage out of season, made by thoughts </l>
               <l>Unhealthy and vexatious. With the hour, </l>
               <l>That from the press of Paris duly brought </l>
               <l>Its freight of public news, the fever came, </l>
               <l>A punctual visitant, to shake this man, </l>
               <l>Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek </l>
               <l>Into a thousand colours; while he read, </l>
               <l>Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch </l>
               <l>Continually, like an uneasy place </l>
               <l>In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour </l>
               <l>Of universal ferment; mildest men </l>
               <l>Were agitated, and commotions, strife </l>
               <l>Of passion and opinion, filled the walls </l>
               <l>Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds. </l>
               <l>The soil of common life was, at that time, </l>
               <l>Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then, </l>
               <l>And not then only, “What a mockery this </l>
               <l>Of history, the past and that to come! </l>

               <l>Faith given to vanity and emptiness; </l>

               <l>To future times the face of what now is!” </l>
               <l>The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain </l>

               <l>A hundred other names, forgotten now, </l>
               <l>Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers, </l>

               <l>This was their undisguised intent, and they </l>

               <l>Even by these passing spectacles my heart </l>
               <l>Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemed </l>
               <l>Arguments sent from Heaven to prove the cause </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Among that band of Officers was one, </l>
               <l>Already hinted at, of other mould— </l>
               <l>A patriot, thence rejected by the rest, </l>
               <l>And with an oriental loathing spurned, </l>
               <l>As of a different caste. A meeker man </l>
               <l>Than this lived never, nor a more benign, </l>
               <l>Meek though enthusiastic. Injuries </l>
               <l>Made ‘him’ more gracious, and his nature then </l>
               <l>Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly, </l>
               <l>As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf, </l>
               <l>When foot hath crushed them. He through the events </l>
               <l>Of that great change wandered in perfect faith, </l>
               <l>As through a book, an old romance, or tale </l>
               <l>Of Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought </l>
               <l>Behind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked </l>
               <l>With the most noble, but unto the poor </l>
               <l>Among mankind he was in service bound, </l>
               <l>As by some tie invisible, oaths professed </l>
               <l>To a religious order. Man he loved </l>
               <l>As man; and, to the mean and the obscure, </l>
               <l>And all the homely in their homely works, </l>
               <l>Transferred a courtesy which had no air </l>
               <l>Of condescension; but did rather seem </l>
               <l>A passion and a gallantry, like that </l>
               <l>Which he, a soldier, in his idler day </l>
               <l>Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he was, </l>
               <l>Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity, </l>
               <l>But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy </l>
               <l>Diffused around him, while he was intent </l>
               <l>On works of love or freedom, or revolved </l>
               <l>Complacently the progress of a cause, </l>
               <l>Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek </l>
               <l>And placid, and took nothing from the man </l>
               <l>That was delightful. Oft in solitude </l>
               <l>With him did I discourse about the end </l>
               <l>Of civil government, and its wisest forms; </l>
               <l>Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights, </l>
               <l>Custom and habit, novelty and change; </l>
               <l>Of self-respect, and virtue in the few </l>
               <l>For patrimonial honour set apart, </l>
               <l>And ignorance in the labouring multitude. </l>
               <l>For he, to all intolerance indisposed, </l>
               <l>Balanced these contemplations in his mind; </l>
               <l>And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped </l>
               <l>Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment </l>
               <l>Than later days allowed; carried about me, </l>

               <l>The experience of past ages, as, through help </l>

               <l>In the green dales beside our Rotha's stream, </l>
               <l>Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill, </l>

               <l>  Along that very Loire, with festal mirth </l>

               <l>Of civil slaughter, was our frequent walk; </l>
               <l>Or in wide forests of continuous shade, </l>
               <l>Lofty and over-arched, with open space </l>
               <l>Beneath the trees, clear footing many a mile— </l>
               <l>A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts, </l>
               <l>From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought, </l>
               <l>And let remembrance steal to other times, </l>
               <l>When, o'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad, </l>
               <l>And smooth as marble or a waveless sea, </l>
               <l>Some Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace </l>
               <l>In sylvan meditation undisturbed; </l>
               <l>As on the pavement of a Gothic church </l>

               <l>In peace and silence. But if e'er was heard,— </l>
               <l>Heard, though unseen,—a devious traveller, </l>
               <l>Retiring or approaching from afar </l>
               <l>With speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs </l>
               <l>From the hard floor reverberated, then </l>
               <l>It was Angelica thundering through the woods </l>
               <l>Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maid </l>
               <l>Erminia, fugitive as fair as she. </l>
               <l>Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knights </l>
               <l>Joust underneath the trees, that as in storm </l>
               <l>Rocked high above their heads; anon, the din </l>
               <l>Of boisterous merriment, and music's roar, </l>
               <l>In sudden proclamation, burst from haunt </l>
               <l>Of Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance </l>
               <l>Rejoicing o'er a female in the midst, </l>
               <l>A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall. </l>
               <l>The width of those huge forests, unto me </l>
               <l>A novel scene, did often in this way </l>
               <l>Master my fancy while I wandered on </l>
               <l>With that revered companion. And sometimes— </l>
               <l>When to a convent in a meadow green, </l>
               <l>By a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile, </l>
               <l>And not by reverential touch of Time </l>
               <l>Dismantled, but by violence abrupt— </l>
               <l>In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies, </l>
               <l>In spite of real fervour, and of that </l>
               <l>Less genuine and wrought up within myself— </l>
               <l>I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh, </l>
               <l>And for the Matin-bell to sound no more </l>
               <l>Grieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross </l>
               <l>High on the topmost pinnacle, a sign </l>
               <l>(How welcome to the weary traveller's eyes!) </l>
               <l>Of hospitality and peaceful rest. </l>

               <l>To the imperial edifice of Blois, </l>

               <l>From my remembrance, where a lady lodged, </l>
               <l>By the first Francis wooed, and bound to him </l>
               <l>In chains of mutual passion, from the tower, </l>
               <l>As a tradition of the country tells, </l>
               <l>Practised to commune with her royal knight </l>

               <l>'Twixt her high-seated residence and his </l>

               <l>Religious, 'mid those frequent monuments </l>
               <l>Of Kings, their vices and their better deeds, </l>

               <l>At times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn, </l>
               <l>Did also often mitigate the force </l>
               <l>Of civic prejudice, the bigotry, </l>
               <l>So call it, of a youthful patriot's mind; </l>
               <l>And on these spots with many gleams I looked </l>
               <l>Of chivalrous delight. Yet not the less, </l>
               <l>Hatred of absolute rule, where will of one </l>
               <l>Is law for all, and of that barren pride </l>
               <l>In them who, by immunities unjust, </l>
               <l>Between the sovereign and the people stand, </l>
               <l>His helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold </l>
               <l>Daily upon me, mixed with pity too </l>
               <l>And love; for where hope is, there love will be </l>
               <l>For the abject multitude, And when we chanced </l>
               <l>One day to meet a hunger-bitten girl, </l>
               <l>Who crept along fitting her languid gait </l>
               <l>Unto a heifer's motion, by a cord </l>
               <l>Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane </l>
               <l>Its sustenance, while the girl with pallid hands </l>
               <l>Was busy knitting in a heartless mood </l>
               <l>Of solitude, and at the sight my friend </l>
               <l>In agitation said, “'Tis against ‘that’ </l>
               <l>That we are fighting,” I with him believed </l>
               <l>That a benignant spirit was abroad </l>
               <l>Which might not be withstood, that poverty </l>
               <l>Abject as this would in a little time </l>
               <l>Be found no more, that we should see the earth </l>
               <l>Unthwarted in her wish to recompense </l>
               <l>The meek, the lowly, patient child of toil, </l>
               <l>All institutes for ever blotted out </l>

               <l>Whether by edict of the one or few; </l>
               <l>And finally, as sum and crown of all, </l>
               <l>Should see the people having a strong hand </l>
               <l>In framing their own laws; whence better days </l>
               <l>To all mankind. But, these things set apart, </l>
               <l>Was not this single confidence enough </l>
               <l>To animate the mind that ever turned </l>
               <l>A thought to human welfare? That henceforth </l>
               <l>Captivity by mandate without law </l>

               <l>Be free to breathe in, and the heart of man </l>
               <l>Dread nothing. From this height I shall not stoop </l>
               <l>To humbler matter that detained us oft </l>
               <l>In thought or conversation, public acts, </l>
               <l>And public persons, and emotions wrought </l>
               <l>Within the breast, as ever-varying winds </l>
               <l>Of record or report swept over us; </l>
               <l>But I might here, instead, repeat a tale, </l>
               <l>Told by my Patriot friend, of sad events, </l>
               <l>That prove to what low depth had struck the roots, </l>
               <l>How widely spread the boughs, of that old tree </l>
               <l>Which, as a deadly mischief, and a foul </l>
               <l>And black dishonour, France was weary of. </l>

               <l>  Oh, happy time of youthful lovers, (thus </l>
               <l>The story might begin,) oh, balmy time, </l>
               <l>In which a love-knot, on a lady's brow, </l>
               <l>Is fairer than the fairest star in Heaven! </l>
               <l>So might—and with that prelude ‘did’ begin </l>
               <l>The record; and, in faithful verse, was given </l>
               <l>The doleful sequel. </l>

               <l>On a strong river boldly hath been launched; </l>
               <l>And from the driving current should we turn </l>
               <l>To loiter wilfully within a creek, </l>
               <l>Howe'er attractive, Fellow voyager! </l>
               <l>Would'st thou not chide? Yet deem not my pains lost: </l>
               <l>For Vaudracour and Julia (so were named </l>
               <l>The ill-fated pair) in that plain tale will draw </l>
               <l>Tears from the hearts of others, when their own </l>
               <l>Shall beat no more. Thou, also, there may'st read, </l>
               <l>At leisure, how the enamoured youth was driven, </l>
               <l>By public power abased, to fatal crime, </l>
               <l>Nature's rebellion against monstrous law; </l>
               <l>How, between heart and heart, oppression thrust </l>
               <l>Her mandates, severing whom true love had joined, </l>
               <l>Harassing both; until he sank and pressed </l>
               <l>The couch his fate had made for him; supine, </l>
               <l>Save when the stings of viperous remorse, </l>
               <l>Trying their strength, enforced him to start up, </l>
               <l>Aghast and prayerless. Into a deep wood </l>
               <l>He fled, to shun the haunts of human kind; </l>
               <l>There dwelt, weakened in spirit more and more; </l>
               <l>Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France </l>
               <l>Full speedily resounded, public hope, </l>
               <l>Or personal memory of his own worst wrongs, </l>
               <l>Rouse him; but, hidden in those gloomy shades, </l>
               <l>His days he wasted,—an imbecile mind. </l>

               <l>IT was a beautiful and silent day </l>
               <l>That overspread the countenance of earth, </l>
               <l>Then fading with unusual quietness,— </l>
               <l>A day as beautiful as e'er was given </l>
               <l>To soothe regret, though deepening what it soothed, </l>
               <l>When by the gliding Loire I paused, and cast </l>
               <l>Upon his rich domains, vineyard and tilth, </l>
               <l>Green meadow-ground, and many-coloured woods, </l>
               <l>Again, and yet again, a farewell look; </l>
               <l>Then from the quiet of that scene passed on, </l>
               <l>Bound to the fierce Metropolis. From his throne </l>
               <l>The King had fallen, and that invading host— </l>
               <l>Presumptuous cloud, on whose black front was written </l>
               <l>The tender mercies of the dismal wind </l>
               <l>That bore it—on the plains of Liberty </l>
               <l>Had burst innocuous. Say in bolder words, </l>
               <l>They—who had come elate as eastern hunters </l>
               <l>Banded beneath the Great Mogul, when he </l>
               <l>Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore, </l>
               <l>Rajahs and Omrahs in his train, intent </l>
               <l>To drive their prey enclosed within a ring </l>
               <l>Wide as a province, but, the signal given, </l>
               <l>Before the point of the life-threatening spear </l>
               <l>Narrowing itself by moments—they, rash men, </l>
               <l>Had seen the anticipated quarry turned </l>
               <l>Into avengers, from whose wrath they fled </l>
               <l>In terror. Disappointment and dismay </l>
               <l>Remained for all whose fancies had run wild </l>
               <l>With evil expectations; confidence </l>
               <l>And perfect triumph for the better cause. </l>

               <l>Show what she was, a high and fearless soul, </l>
               <l>Exulting in defiance, or heart-stung </l>

               <l>To a new transition—when the King was crushed, </l>
               <l>Spared not the empty throne, and in proud haste </l>
               <l>Assumed the body and venerable name </l>
               <l>Of a Republic. Lamentable crimes, </l>
               <l>'Tis true, had gone before this hour, dire work </l>
               <l>Of massacre, in which the senseless sword </l>
               <l>Was prayed to as a judge; but these were past, </l>
               <l>Earth free from them for ever, as was thought,— </l>
               <l>Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once! </l>
               <l>Things that could only show themselves and die. </l>

            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Cheered with this hope, to Paris I returned, </l>
               <l>And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt, </l>
               <l>The spacious city, and in progress passed </l>
               <l>The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay, </l>
               <l>Associate with his children and his wife </l>
               <l>In bondage; and the palace, lately stormed </l>
               <l>With roar of cannon by a furious host. </l>
               <l>I crossed the square (an empty area then!) </l>
               <l>Of the Carrousel, where so late had lain </l>
               <l>The dead, upon the dying heaped, and gazed </l>
               <l>On this and other spots, as doth a man </l>
               <l>Upon a volume whose contents he knows </l>
               <l>Are memorable, but from him locked up, </l>
               <l>Being written in a tongue he cannot read, </l>
               <l>So that he questions the mute leaves with pain, </l>
               <l>And half upbraids their silence. But that night </l>
               <l>I felt most deeply in what world I was, </l>
               <l>What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed. </l>
               <l>High was my room and lonely, near the roof </l>
               <l>Of a large mansion or hotel, a lodge </l>
               <l>That would have pleased me in more quiet times; </l>
               <l>Nor was it wholly without pleasure then. </l>
               <l>With unextinguished taper I kept watch, </l>
               <l>Reading at intervals; the fear gone by </l>
               <l>Pressed on me almost like a fear to come. </l>
               <l>I thought of those September massacres, </l>
               <l>Divided from me by one little month, </l>
               <l>Saw them and touched: the rest was conjured up </l>
               <l>From tragic fictions or true history, </l>
               <l>Remembrances and dim admonishments. </l>
               <l>The horse is taught his manage, and no star </l>
               <l>Of wildest course but treads back his own steps; </l>
               <l>For the spent hurricane the air provides </l>
               <l>As fierce a successor; the tide retreats </l>
               <l>But to return out of its hiding-place </l>
               <l>In the great deep; all things have second birth; </l>
               <l>The earthquake is not satisfied at once; </l>
               <l>And in this way I wrought upon myself, </l>
               <l>Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried, </l>
               <l>To the whole city, “Sleep no more.” The trance </l>
               <l>Fled with the voice to which it had given birth; </l>
               <l>But vainly comments of a calmer mind </l>
               <l>Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness. </l>
               <l>The place, all hushed and silent as it was, </l>
               <l>Appeared unfit for the repose of night, </l>
               <l>Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  With early morning towards the Palace-walk </l>
               <l>Of Orleans eagerly I turned: as yet </l>
               <l>The streets were still; not so those long Arcades; </l>
               <l>There, 'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries, </l>
               <l>That greeted me on entering, I could hear </l>
               <l>Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng, </l>
               <l>Bawling, “Denunciation of the Crimes </l>
               <l>Of Maximilian Robespierre;” the hand, </l>
               <l>Prompt as the voice, held forth a printed speech, </l>
               <l>The same that had been recently pronounced, </l>
               <l>When Robespierre, not ignorant for what mark </l>
               <l>Some words of indirect reproof had been </l>
               <l>Intended, rose in hardihood, and dared </l>
               <l>The man who had an ill surmise of him </l>
               <l>To bring his charge in openness; whereat, </l>
               <l>When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirred, </l>
               <l>In silence of all present, from his seat </l>
               <l>Louvet walked single through the avenue, </l>
               <l>And took his station in the Tribune, saying, </l>
               <l>“I, Robespierre, accuse thee!” Well is known </l>
               <l>The inglorious issue of that charge, and how </l>
               <l>He, who had launched the startling thunderbolt, </l>
               <l>The one bold man, whose voice the attack had sounded, </l>
               <l>Was left without a follower to discharge </l>
               <l>His perilous duty, and retire lamenting </l>
               <l>That Heaven's best aid is wasted upon men </l>
               <l>Who to themselves are false. </l>
               <l>                              But these are things </l>
               <l>Of which I speak, only as they were storm </l>
               <l>Or sunshine to my individual mind, </l>
               <l>No further. Let me then relate that now— </l>
               <l>In some sort seeing with my proper eyes </l>
               <l>That Liberty, and Life, and Death, would soon </l>
               <l>To the remotest corners of the land </l>
               <l>Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled </l>
               <l>The capital City; what was struggled for, </l>
               <l>And by what combatants victory must be won; </l>
               <l>The indecision on their part whose aim </l>
               <l>Seemed best, and the straightforward path of those </l>
               <l>Who in attack or in defence were strong </l>
               <l>Through their impiety—my inmost soul </l>
               <l>Was agitated; yea, I could almost </l>
               <l>Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men, </l>
               <l>By patient exercise of reason made </l>
               <l>Worthy of liberty, all spirits filled </l>
               <l>With zeal expanding in Truth's holy light, </l>
               <l>The gift of tongues might fall, and power arrive </l>
               <l>From the four quarters of the winds to do </l>
               <l>For France, what without help she could not do, </l>
               <l>A work of honour; think not that to this </l>
               <l>I added, work of safety: from all doubt </l>
               <l>Or trepidation for the end of things </l>
               <l>Far was I, far as angels are from guilt. </l>

               <l>  Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thought </l>
               <l>Of opposition and of remedies: </l>
               <l>An insignificant stranger and obscure, </l>
               <l>And one, moreover, little graced with power </l>
               <l>Of eloquence even in my native speech, </l>

               <l>Service however dangerous. I revolved, </l>
               <l>How much the destiny of Man had still </l>
               <l>Hung upon single persons; that there was, </l>
               <l>Transcendent to all local patrimony, </l>
               <l>One nature, as there is one sun in heaven; </l>
               <l>That objects, even as they are great, thereby </l>
               <l>Do come within the reach of humblest eyes; </l>
               <l>That Man is only weak through his mistrust </l>
               <l>And want of hope where evidence divine </l>
               <l>Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure; </l>
               <l>Nor did the inexperience of my youth </l>
               <l>Preclude conviction, that a spirit strong </l>
               <l>In hope, and trained to noble aspirations, </l>
               <l>A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself, </l>
               <l>Is for Society's unreasoning herd </l>
               <l>A domineering instinct, serves at once </l>
               <l>For way and guide, a fluent receptacle </l>
               <l>That gathers up each petty straggling rill </l>
               <l>And vein of water, glad to be rolled on </l>
               <l>In safe obedience; that a mind, whose rest </l>
               <l>Is where it ought to be, in self-restraint, </l>
               <l>In circumspection and simplicity, </l>
               <l>Falls rarely in entire discomfiture </l>
               <l>Below its aim, or meets with, from without, </l>
               <l>A treachery that foils it or defeats; </l>
               <l>And, lastly, if the means on human will, </l>
               <l>Frail human will, dependent should betray </l>

               <l>On which, with a diversity of pace, </l>
               <l>I had been travelling: this a stride at once </l>

               <l>On me uplifted from the vantage-ground </l>
               <l>Of pity and sorrow to a state of being </l>
               <l>That through the time's exceeding fierceness saw </l>
               <l>Glimpses of retribution, terrible, </l>
               <l>And in the order of sublime behests: </l>
               <l>But, even if that were not, amid the awe </l>
               <l>Of unintelligible chastisement, </l>
               <l>Not only acquiescences of faith </l>
               <l>Survived, but daring sympathies with power, </l>
               <l>Motions not treacherous or profane, else why </l>
               <l>Within the folds of no ungentle breast </l>
               <l>Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged? </l>
               <l>Wild blasts of music thus could find their way </l>
               <l>Into the midst of turbulent events; </l>
               <l>So that worst tempests might be listened to. </l>
               <l>Then was the truth received into my heart, </l>
               <l>That, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring, </l>
               <l>If from the affliction somewhere do not grow </l>
               <l>Honour which could not else have been, a faith, </l>
               <l>An elevation, and a sanctity, </l>
               <l>If new strength be not given nor old restored, </l>
               <l>The blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt </l>
               <l>Was taken up by scoffers in their pride, </l>
               <l>Saying, “Behold the harvest that we reap </l>
               <l>From popular government and equality,” </l>
               <l>I clearly saw that neither these nor aught </l>
               <l>Of wild belief engrafted on their names </l>
               <l>By false philosophy had caused the woe, </l>
               <l>But a terrific reservoir of guilt </l>
               <l>And ignorance filled up from age to age, </l>
               <l>That could no longer hold its loathsome charge, </l>
               <l>But burst and spread in deluge through the land. </l>

               <l>With happy faces and with garlands hung, </l>
               <l>And through a rainbow-arch that spanned the street, </l>
               <l>Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed, </l>
               <l>I paced, a dear companion at my side, </l>
               <l>The town of Arras, whence with promise high </l>
               <l>Issued, on delegation to sustain </l>
               <l>Humanity and right, ‘that’ Robespierre, </l>
               <l>He who thereafter, and in how short time! </l>
               <l>Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew. </l>

               <l>Under the vengeance of her cruel son, </l>
               <l>As Lear reproached the winds—I could almost </l>

               <l>So dreaded, so abhorred. The day deserves </l>
               <l>A separate record. Over the smooth sands </l>

               <l>My journey, and beneath a genial sun, </l>

               <l>Sad opposites out of the inner heart, </l>

               <l>Lines from the churchyard elegy of Gray. </l>
               <l>This faithful guide, speaking from his deathbed, </l>

               <l>Would have loved me, as one not destitute </l>

               <l>  As I advanced, all that I saw or felt </l>

               <l>Yet everything was wanting that might give </l>
               <l>Courage to them who looked for good by light </l>
               <l>Of rational Experience, for the shoots </l>
               <l>And hopeful blossoms of a second spring: </l>
               <l>Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired; </l>
               <l>The Senate's language, and the public acts </l>
               <l>And measures of the Government, though both </l>
               <l>Weak, and of heartless omen, had not power </l>
               <l>To daunt me; in the People was my trust: </l>
               <l>And, in the virtues which mine eyes had seen, </l>
               <l>I knew that wound external could not take </l>
               <l>Life from the young Republic; that new foes </l>
               <l>Would only follow, in the path of shame, </l>
               <l>Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end </l>
               <l>Great, universal, irresistible. </l>
               <l>This intuition led me to confound </l>
               <l>One victory with another, higher far,— </l>
               <l>Triumphs of unambitious peace at home, </l>
               <l>And noiseless fortitude. Beholding still </l>
               <l>Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought </l>
               <l>That what was in degree the same was likewise </l>
               <l>The same in quality,—that, as the worse </l>
               <l>Of the two spirits then at strife remained </l>
               <l>Untired, the better, surely, would preserve </l>
               <l>The heart that first had roused him. Youth maintains, </l>
               <l>In all conditions of society, </l>
               <l>Communion more direct and intimate </l>
               <l>With Nature,—hence, ofttimes, with reason too— </l>
               <l>Than age or manhood, even. To Nature, then, </l>
               <l>Power had reverted: habit, custom, law, </l>
               <l>Had left an interregnum's open space </l>
               <l>For ‘her’ to move about in, uncontrolled. </l>
               <l>Hence could I see how Babel-like their task, </l>
               <l>Who, by the recent deluge stupified, </l>
               <l>With their whole souls went culling from the day </l>
               <l>Its petty promises, to build a tower </l>
               <l>For their own safety; laughed with my compeers </l>
               <l>At gravest heads, by enmity to France </l>

               <l>Like credit to ourselves where less was due, </l>
               <l>And thought that other notions were as sound </l>
               <l>Yea, could not but be right, because we saw </l>
               <l>That foolish men opposed them. </l>

               <l>Reality too close and too intense, </l>

               <l>Much, as it seemed, I was no further changed </l>
               <l>Than as a clouded and a waning moon: </l>
               <l>She whispered still that brightness would return; </l>
               <l>She, in the midst of all, preserved me still </l>
               <l>A Poet, made me seek beneath that name, </l>
               <l>And that alone, my office upon earth; </l>
               <l>And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown, </l>
               <l>If willing audience fail not, Nature's self, </l>
               <l>By all varieties of human love </l>
               <l>Assisted, led me back through opening day </l>
               <l>To those sweet counsels between head and heart </l>
               <l>Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace, </l>
               <l>Which, through the later sinkings of this cause, </l>
               <l>Hath still upheld me, and upholds me now </l>
               <l>In the catastrophe (for so they dream, </l>
               <l>And nothing less), when, finally to close </l>
               <l>And seal up all the gains of France, a Pope </l>
               <l>Is summoned in, to crown an Emperor— </l>
               <l>This last opprobrium, when we see a people, </l>
               <l>That once looked up in faith, as if to Heaven </l>
               <l>For manna, take a lesson from the dog </l>
               <l>Returning to his vomit; when the sun </l>
               <l>That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved </l>
               <l>In exultation with a living pomp </l>
               <l>Of clouds—his glory's natural retinue— </l>
               <l>Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed, </l>
               <l>And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine, </l>
               <l>Sets like an Opera phantom. </l>
               <l>                             Thus, O Friend! </l>
               <l>Through times of honour and through times of shame </l>
               <l>Descending, have I faithfully retraced </l>
               <l>The perturbations of a youthful mind </l>
               <l>Under a long-lived storm of great events— </l>
               <l>A story destined for thy ear, who now, </l>
               <l>Among the fallen of nations, dost abide </l>
               <l>Where Etna, over hill and valley, casts </l>
               <l>His shadow stretching towards Syracuse, </l>
               <l>The city of Timoleon! Righteous Heaven! </l>
               <l>How are the mighty prostrated! They first, </l>
               <l>They first of all that breathe should have awaked </l>
               <l>When the great voice was heard from out the tombs </l>
               <l>Of ancient heroes. If I suffered grief </l>
               <l>For ill-requited France, by many deemed </l>
               <l>A trifler only in her proudest day; </l>
               <l>Have been distressed to think of what she once </l>
               <l>Promised, now is; a far more sober cause </l>
               <l>Thine eyes must see of sorrow in a land, </l>
               <l>To the reanimating influence lost </l>
               <l>Of memory, to virtue lost and hope, </l>

               <l>Bent overmuch on superficial things, </l>
               <l>Pampering myself with meagre novelties </l>
               <l>Of colour and proportion; to the moods </l>
               <l>Of time and season, to the moral power, </l>
               <l>The affections and the spirit of the place, </l>
               <l>Insensible. Nor only did the love </l>
               <l>Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt </l>
               <l>My deeper feelings, but another cause, </l>
               <l>More subtle and less easily explained, </l>
               <l>That almost seems inherent in the creature, </l>
               <l>A twofold frame of body and of mind. </l>
               <l>I speak in recollection of a time </l>
               <l>When the bodily eye, in every stage of life </l>
               <l>The most despotic of our senses, gained </l>
               <l>Such strength in ‘me’ as often held my mind </l>
               <l>In absolute dominion. Gladly here, </l>
               <l>Entering upon abstruser argument, </l>
               <l>Could I endeavour to unfold the means </l>
               <l>Which Nature studiously employs to thwart </l>
               <l>This tyranny, summons all the senses each </l>
               <l>To counteract the other, and themselves, </l>
               <l>And makes them all, and the objects with which all </l>
               <l>Are conversant, subservient in their turn </l>
               <l>To the great ends of Liberty and Power. </l>
               <l>But leave we this: enough that my delights </l>
               <l>(Such as they were) were sought insatiably. </l>
               <l>Vivid the transport, vivid though not profound; </l>
               <l>I roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock, </l>
               <l>Still craving combinations of new forms, </l>
               <l>New pleasure, wider empire for the sight, </l>
               <l>Proud of her own endowments, and rejoiced </l>
               <l>To lay the inner faculties asleep. </l>
               <l>Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife </l>
               <l>And various trials of our complex being, </l>
               <l>As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense </l>
               <l>Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid, </l>
               <l>A young enthusiast, who escaped these bonds; </l>
               <l>Her eye was not the mistress of her heart; </l>
               <l>Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste, </l>
               <l>Or barren intermeddling subtleties, </l>
               <l>Perplex her mind; but, wise as women are </l>
               <l>When genial circumstance hath favoured them, </l>
               <l>She welcomed what was given, and craved no more; </l>
               <l>Whate'er the scene presented to her view </l>
               <l>That was the best, to that she was attuned </l>
               <l>By her benign simplicity of life, </l>
               <l>And through a perfect happiness of soul, </l>
               <l>Whose variegated feelings were in this </l>
               <l>Sisters, that they were each some new delight. </l>
               <l>Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field, </l>
               <l>Could they have known her, would have loved; methought </l>
               <l>Her very presence such a sweetness breathed, </l>
               <l>That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills, </l>
               <l>And everything she looked on, should have had </l>
               <l>An intimation how she bore herself </l>
               <l>Towards them and to all creatures. God delights </l>
               <l>In such a being; for, her common thoughts </l>
               <l>Are piety, her life is gratitude. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Even like this maid, before I was called forth </l>
               <l>From the retirement of my native hills, </l>
               <l>I loved whate'er I saw: nor lightly loved, </l>
               <l>But most intensely; never dreamt of aught </l>
               <l>More grand, more fair, more exquisitely framed </l>
               <l>Than those few nooks to which my happy feet </l>
               <l>Were limited. I had not at that time </l>
               <l>Lived long enough, nor in the least survived </l>
               <l>The first diviner influence of this world, </l>
               <l>As it appears to unaccustomed eyes. </l>
               <l>Worshipping them among the depth of things, </l>
               <l>As piety ordained, could I submit </l>
               <l>To measured admiration, or to aught </l>
               <l>That should preclude humility and love? </l>
               <l>I felt, observed, and pondered; did not judge, </l>
               <l>Yea, never thought of judging; with the gift </l>
               <l>Of all this glory filled and satisfied. </l>
               <l>And afterwards, when through the gorgeous Alps </l>
               <l>Roaming, I carried with me the same heart: </l>
               <l>In truth, the degradation—howsoe'er </l>
               <l>Induced, effect, in whatsoe'er degree, </l>
               <l>Of custom that prepares a partial scale </l>
               <l>In which the little oft outweighs the great; </l>
               <l>Or any other cause that hath been named; </l>
               <l>Or lastly, aggravated by the times </l>
               <l>And their impassioned sounds, which well might make </l>
               <l>The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes </l>
               <l>Inaudible—was transient; I had known </l>
               <l>Too forcibly, too early in my life, </l>
               <l>Visitings of imaginative power </l>
               <l>For this to last: I shook the habit off </l>
               <l>Entirely and for ever, and again </l>
               <l>In Nature's presence stood, as now I stand, </l>
               <l>A sensitive being, a ‘creative’ soul. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  There are in our existence spots of time, </l>
               <l>That with distinct pre-eminence retain </l>
               <l>A renovating virtue, whence—depressed </l>
               <l>By false opinion and contentious thought, </l>
               <l>Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight, </l>
               <l>In trivial occupations, and the round </l>
               <l>Of ordinary intercourse—our minds </l>
               <l>Are nourished and invisibly repaired; </l>
               <l>A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced, </l>
               <l>That penetrates, enables us to mount, </l>
               <l>When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen. </l>
               <l>This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks </l>
               <l>Among those passages of life that give </l>
               <l>Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how, </l>
               <l>The mind is lord and master—outward sense </l>
               <l>The obedient servant of her will. Such moments </l>
               <l>Are scattered everywhere, taking their date </l>
               <l>From our first childhood. I remember well, </l>
               <l>That once, while yet my inexperienced hand </l>
               <l>Could scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes </l>
               <l>I mounted, and we journeyed towards the hills: </l>
               <l>An ancient servant of my father's house </l>
               <l>Was with me, my encourager and guide: </l>
               <l>We had not travelled long, ere some mischance </l>
               <l>Disjoined me from my comrade; and, through fear </l>
               <l>Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor </l>
               <l>I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length </l>
               <l>Came to a bottom, where in former times </l>
               <l>A murderer had been hung in iron chains. </l>
               <l>The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones </l>
               <l>And iron case were gone; but on the turf, </l>
               <l>Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought, </l>
               <l>Some unknown hand had carved the murderer's name. </l>
               <l>The monumental letters were inscribed </l>
               <l>In times long past; but still, from year to year </l>
               <l>By superstition of the neighbourhood, </l>
               <l>The grass is cleared away, and to this hour </l>
               <l>The characters are fresh and visible: </l>
               <l>A casual glance had shown them, and I fled, </l>
               <l>Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road: </l>
               <l>Then, reascending the bare common, saw </l>
               <l>A naked pool that lay beneath the hills, </l>
               <l>The beacon on the summit, and, more near, </l>
               <l>A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head, </l>
               <l>And seemed with difficult steps to force her way </l>
               <l>Against the blowing wind. It was, in truth, </l>
               <l>An ordinary sight; but I should need </l>
               <l>Colours and words that are unknown to man, </l>
               <l>To paint the visionary dreariness </l>
               <l>Which, while I looked all round for my lost guide, </l>
               <l>Invested moorland waste and naked pool, </l>
               <l>The beacon crowning the lone eminence, </l>
               <l>The female and her garments vexed and tossed </l>
               <l>By the strong wind. When, in the blessed hours </l>
               <l>Of early love, the loved one at my side, </l>
               <l>I roamed, in daily presence of this scene, </l>
               <l>Upon the naked pool and dreary crags, </l>
               <l>And on the melancholy beacon, fell </l>
               <l>A spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam; </l>
               <l>And think ye not with radiance more sublime </l>
               <l>For these remembrances, and for the power </l>
               <l>They had left behind? So feeling comes in aid </l>
               <l>Of feeling, and diversity of strength </l>
               <l>Attends us, if but once we have been strong. </l>
               <l>Oh! mystery of man, from what a depth </l>
               <l>Proceed thy honours. I am lost, but see </l>
               <l>In simple childhood something of the base </l>
               <l>On which thy greatness stands; but this I feel, </l>
               <l>That from thyself it comes, that thou must give, </l>
               <l>Else never canst receive. The days gone by </l>
               <l>Return upon me almost from the dawn </l>
               <l>Of life: the hiding-places of man's power </l>
               <l>Open; I would approach them, but they close. </l>
               <l>I see by glimpses now; when age comes on, </l>
               <l>May scarcely see at all; and I would give, </l>
               <l>While yet we may, as far as words can give, </l>
               <l>Substance and life to what I feel, enshrining, </l>
               <l>Such is my hope, the spirit of the Past </l>
               <l>For future restoration.—Yet another </l>
               <l>Of these memorials:— </l>
               <l>                       One Christmas-time, </l>
               <l>On the glad eve of its dear holidays, </l>
               <l>Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth </l>
               <l>Into the fields, impatient for the sight </l>
               <l>Of those led palfreys that should bear us home; </l>
               <l>My brothers and myself. There rose a crag, </l>
               <l>That, from the meeting-point of two highways </l>
               <l>Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched; </l>
               <l>Thither, uncertain on which road to fix </l>
               <l>My expectation, thither I repaired, </l>
               <l>Scout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day </l>
               <l>Tempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass </l>
               <l>I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall; </l>
               <l>Upon my right hand couched a single sheep, </l>
               <l>Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood; </l>
               <l>With those companions at my side, I watched </l>
               <l>Straining my eyes intensely, as the mist </l>
               <l>Gave intermitting prospect of the copse </l>
               <l>And plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,— </l>
               <l>That dreary time,—ere we had been ten days </l>
               <l>Sojourners in my father's house, he died; </l>
               <l>And I and my three brothers, orphans then, </l>
               <l>Followed his body to the grave. The event, </l>
               <l>With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared </l>
               <l>A chastisement; and when I called to mind </l>
               <l>That day so lately past, when from the crag </l>
               <l>I looked in such anxiety of hope; </l>
               <l>With trite reflections of morality, </l>
               <l>Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low </l>
               <l>To God, Who thus corrected my desires; </l>
               <l>And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain, </l>
               <l>And all the business of the elements, </l>
               <l>The single sheep, and the one blasted tree, </l>
               <l>And the bleak music from that old stone wall, </l>
               <l>The noise of wood and water, and the mist </l>
               <l>That on the line of each of those two roads </l>
               <l>Advanced in such indisputable shapes; </l>
               <l>All these were kindred spectacles and sounds </l>
               <l>To which I oft repaired, and thence would drink, </l>
               <l>As at a fountain; and on winter nights, </l>
               <l>Down to this very time, when storm and rain </l>
               <l>Beat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day, </l>
               <l>While in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees, </l>
               <l>Laden with summer's thickest foliage, rock </l>
               <l>In a strong wind, some working of the spirit, </l>
               <l>Some inward agitations thence are brought, </l>
               <l>Whate'er their office, whether to beguile </l>
               <l>Thoughts over busy in the course they took, </l>
               <l>Or animate an hour of vacant ease. </l>

               <l>To consecrate, if we have eyes to see, </l>
               <l>The outside of her creatures, and to breathe </l>
               <l>Grandeur upon the very humblest face </l>
               <l>Of human life. I felt that the array </l>
               <l>Of act and circumstance, and visible form, </l>
               <l>Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind </l>
               <l>What passion makes them; that meanwhile the forms </l>
               <l>Of Nature have a passion in themselves, </l>
               <l>That intermingles with those works of man </l>
               <l>To which she summons him; although the works </l>
               <l>Be mean, have nothing lofty of their own; </l>
               <l>And that the Genius of the Poet hence </l>
               <l>May boldly take his way among mankind </l>
               <l>Wherever Nature leads; that he hath stood </l>
               <l>By Nature's side among the men of old, </l>
               <l>And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend! </l>
               <l>If thou partake the animating faith </l>
               <l>That Poets, even as Prophets, each with each </l>
               <l>Connected in a mighty scheme of truth, </l>
               <l>Have each his own peculiar faculty, </l>
               <l>Heaven's gift, a sense that fits him to perceive </l>
               <l>Objects unseen before, thou wilt not blame </l>
               <l>The humblest of this band who dares to hope </l>
               <l>That unto him hath also been vouchsafed </l>
               <l>An insight that in some sort he possesses, </l>
               <l>A privilege whereby a work of his, </l>
               <l>Proceeding from a source of untaught things, </l>
               <l>Creative and enduring, may become </l>
               <l>A power like one of Nature's. To a hope </l>
               <l>Not less ambitious once among the wilds </l>
               <l>Of Sarum's Plain, my youthful spirit was raised; </l>
               <l>There, as I ranged at will the pastoral downs </l>
               <l>Trackless and smooth, or paced the bare white roads </l>
               <l>Lengthening in solitude their dreary line, </l>
               <l>Time with his retinue of ages fled </l>
               <l>Backwards, nor checked his flight until I saw </l>
               <l>Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear; </l>
               <l>Saw multitudes of men, and, here and there, </l>
               <l>A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest, </l>
               <l>With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold; </l>
               <l>The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear </l>
               <l>Shaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength, </l>
               <l>Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty. </l>
               <l>I called on Darkness—but before the word </l>
               <l>Was uttered, midnight darkness seemed to take </l>
               <l>All objects from my sight; and lo! again </l>
               <l>The Desert visible by dismal flames; </l>
               <l>It is the sacrificial altar, fed </l>
               <l>With living men—how deep the groans! the voice </l>
               <l>Of those that crowd the giant wicker thrills </l>
               <l>The monumental hillocks, and the pomp </l>
               <l>Is for both worlds, the living and the dead. </l>
               <l>At other moments—(for through that wide waste </l>
               <l>Three summer days I roamed) where'er the Plain </l>
               <l>Was figured o'er with circles, lines, or mounds, </l>
               <l>That yet survive, a work, as some divine, </l>
               <l>Shaped by the Druids, so to represent </l>
               <l>Their knowledge of the heavens, and image forth </l>
               <l>The constellations—gently was I charmed </l>
               <l>Into a waking dream, a reverie </l>
               <l>That, with believing eyes, where'er I turned, </l>
               <l>Beheld long-bearded teachers, with white wands </l>
               <l>Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky, </l>
               <l>Alternately, and plain below, while breath </l>
               <l>Of music swayed their motions, and the waste </l>
               <l>Rejoiced with them and me in those sweet sounds. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  This for the past, and things that may be viewed </l>
               <l>Or fancied in the obscurity of years </l>
               <l>From monumental hints: and thou, O Friend! </l>
               <l>Pleased with some unpremeditated strains </l>
               <l>That served those wanderings to beguile, hast said </l>
               <l>That then and there my mind had exercised </l>
               <l>Upon the vulgar forms of present things, </l>
               <l>The actual world of our familiar days, </l>
               <l>Yet higher power; had caught from them a tone, </l>
               <l>An image, and a character, by books </l>
               <l>Not hitherto reflected. Call we this </l>
               <l>A partial judgment—and yet why? for ‘then’ </l>
               <l>We were as strangers; and I may not speak </l>
               <l>Thus wrongfully of verse, however rude, </l>
               <l>Which on thy young imagination, trained </l>
               <l>In the great City, broke like light from far. </l>
               <l>Moreover, each man's Mind is to herself </l>
               <l>Witness and judge; and I remember well </l>
               <l>That in life's every-day appearances </l>
               <l>I seemed about this time to gain clear sight </l>
               <l>Of a new world—a world, too, that was fit </l>
               <l>To be transmitted, and to other eyes </l>
               <l>Made visible; as ruled by those fixed laws </l>
               <l>Whence spiritual dignity originates, </l>
               <l>Which do both give it being and maintain </l>
               <l>A balance, an ennobling interchange </l>
               <l>Of action from without and from within; </l>
               <l>The excellence, pure function, and best power </l>

               <l>IN one of those excursions (may they ne'er </l>
               <l>Fade from remembrance!) through the Northern tracts </l>
               <l>Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend, </l>
               <l>I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time, </l>
               <l>And westward took my way, to see the sun </l>
               <l>Rise, from the top of Snowdon. To the door </l>
               <l>Of a rude cottage at the mountain's base </l>
               <l>We came, and roused the shepherd who attends </l>
               <l>The adventurous stranger's steps, a trusty guide; </l>
               <l>Then, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  It was a close, warm, breezeless summer night, </l>
               <l>Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fog </l>
               <l>Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky; </l>
               <l>But, undiscouraged, we began to climb </l>
               <l>The mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round, </l>
               <l>And, after ordinary travellers' talk </l>
               <l>With our conductor, pensively we sank </l>
               <l>Each into commerce with his private thoughts: </l>
               <l>Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself </l>
               <l>Was nothing either seen or heard that checked </l>
               <l>Those musings or diverted, save that once </l>
               <l>The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags, </l>
               <l>Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased </l>
               <l>His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent. </l>
               <l>This small adventure, for even such it seemed </l>
               <l>In that wild place and at the dead of night, </l>
               <l>Being over and forgotten, on we wound </l>
               <l>In silence as before. With forehead bent </l>
               <l>Earthward, as if in opposition set </l>
               <l>Against an enemy, I panted up </l>
               <l>With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts. </l>
               <l>Thus might we wear a midnight hour away, </l>
               <l>Ascending at loose distance each from each, </l>
               <l>And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band; </l>
               <l>When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten, </l>
               <l>And with a step or two seemed brighter still; </l>
               <l>Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause, </l>
               <l>For instantly a light upon the turf </l>
               <l>Fell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up, </l>
               <l>The Moon hung naked in a firmament </l>
               <l>Of azure without cloud, and at my feet </l>
               <l>Rested a silent sea of hoary mist. </l>
               <l>A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved </l>
               <l>All over this still ocean; and beyond, </l>
               <l>Far, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched, </l>
               <l>In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, </l>
               <l>Into the main Atlantic, that appeared </l>
               <l>To dwindle, and give up his majesty, </l>
               <l>Usurped upon far as the sight could reach. </l>
               <l>Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none </l>
               <l>Was there, nor loss; only the inferior stars </l>
               <l>Had disappeared, or shed a fainter light </l>
               <l>In the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon, </l>
               <l>Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazed </l>
               <l>Upon the billowy ocean, as it lay </l>
               <l>All meek and silent, save that through a rift— </l>
               <l>Not distant from the shore whereon we stood, </l>
               <l>A fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place— </l>
               <l>Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams </l>
               <l>Innumerable, roaring with one voice! </l>
               <l>Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour, </l>
               <l>For so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  When into air had partially dissolved </l>
               <l>That vision, given to spirits of the night </l>
               <l>And three chance human wanderers, in calm thought </l>
               <l>Reflected, it appeared to me the type </l>
               <l>Of a majestic intellect, its acts </l>
               <l>And its possessions, what it has and craves, </l>
               <l>What in itself it is, and would become. </l>
               <l>There I beheld the emblem of a mind </l>
               <l>That feeds upon infinity, that broods </l>
               <l>Over the dark abyss, intent to hear </l>
               <l>Its voices issuing forth to silent light </l>
               <l>In one continuous stream; a mind sustained </l>
               <l>By recognitions of transcendent power, </l>
               <l>In sense conducting to ideal form, </l>
               <l>In soul of more than mortal privilege. </l>
               <l>One function, above all, of such a mind </l>
               <l>Had Nature shadowed there, by putting forth, </l>
               <l>'Mid circumstances awful and sublime, </l>
               <l>That mutual domination which she loves </l>
               <l>To exert upon the face of outward things, </l>
               <l>So moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowed </l>
               <l>With interchangeable supremacy, </l>
               <l>That men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive, </l>
               <l>And cannot choose but feel. The power, which all </l>
               <l>Acknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus </l>
               <l>To bodily sense exhibits, is the express </l>
               <l>Resemblance of that glorious faculty </l>
               <l>That higher minds bear with them as their own. </l>
               <l>This is the very spirit in which they deal </l>
               <l>With the whole compass of the universe: </l>
               <l>They from their native selves can send abroad </l>
               <l>Kindred mutations; for themselves create </l>
               <l>A like existence; and, whene'er it dawns </l>
               <l>Created for them, catch it, or are caught </l>
               <l>By its inevitable mastery, </l>
               <l>Like angels stopped upon the wing by sound </l>
               <l>Of harmony from Heaven's remotest spheres. </l>
               <l>Them the enduring and the transient both </l>
               <l>Serve to exalt; they build up greatest things </l>
               <l>From least suggestions; ever on the watch, </l>
               <l>Willing to work and to be wrought upon, </l>
               <l>They need not extraordinary calls </l>
               <l>To rouse them; in a world of life they live, </l>
               <l>By sensible impressions not enthralled, </l>
               <l>But by their quickening impulse made more prompt </l>
               <l>To hold fit converse with the spiritual world, </l>
               <l>And with the generations of mankind </l>
               <l>Spread over time, past, present, and to come, </l>
               <l>Age after age, till Time shall be no more. </l>
               <l>Such minds are truly from the Deity, </l>
               <l>For they are Powers; and hence the highest bliss </l>
               <l>That flesh can know is theirs—the consciousness </l>
               <l>Of Whom they are, habitually infused </l>
               <l>Through every image and through every thought, </l>
               <l>And all affections by communion raised </l>
               <l>From earth to heaven, from human to divine; </l>
               <l>Hence endless occupation for the Soul, </l>
               <l>Whether discursive or intuitive; </l>
               <l>Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life, </l>
               <l>Emotions which best foresight need not fear, </l>
               <l>Most worthy then of trust when most intense. </l>
               <l>Hence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that crush </l>
               <l>Our hearts—if here the words of Holy Writ </l>
               <l>May with fit reverence be applied—that peace </l>
               <l>Which passeth understanding, that repose </l>
               <l>In moral judgments which from this pure source </l>
               <l>Must come, or will by man be sought in vain. </l>

               <l>Even as one essence of pervading light </l>

               <l>Thy kindred influence to my heart of hearts </l>

               <l>In misery near the miserable Thorn— </l>
               <l>When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts, </l>
               <l>And hast before thee all which then we were, </l>
               <l>To thee, in memory of that happiness, </l>
               <l>It will be known, by thee at least, my Friend! </l>
               <l>Felt, that the history of a Poet's mind </l>
               <l>Is labour not unworthy of regard; </l>
               <l>To thee the work shall justify itself. </l>

               <l>  The last and later portions of this gift </l>
               <l>Have been prepared, not with the buoyant spirits </l>
               <l>That were our daily portion when we first </l>
               <l>Together wantoned in wild Poesy, </l>
               <l>But, under pressure of a private grief, </l>
               <l>Keen and enduring, which the mind and heart, </l>
               <l>That in this meditative history </l>
               <l>Have been laid open, needs must make me feel </l>
               <l>More deeply, yet enable me to bear </l>
               <l>More firmly; and a comfort now hath risen </l>
               <l>From hope that thou art near, and wilt be soon </l>
               <l>Restored to us in renovated health; </l>
               <l>When, after the first mingling of our tears, </l>
               <l>'Mong other consolations, we may draw </l>
               <l>Some pleasure from this offering of my love. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
               <l>  Oh! yet a few short years of useful life, </l>
               <l>And all will be complete, thy race be run, </l>
               <l>Thy monument of glory will be raised; </l>
               <l>Then, though (too weak to tread the ways of truth) </l>
               <l>This age fall back to old idolatry, </l>
               <l>Though men return to servitude as fast </l>
               <l>As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame, </l>
               <l>By nations, sink together, we shall still </l>
               <l>Find solace—knowing what we have learnt to know, </l>
               <l>Rich in true happiness if allowed to be </l>
               <l>Faithful alike in forwarding a day </l>
               <l>Of firmer trust, joint labourers in the work </l>
               <l>(Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe) </l>
               <l>Of their deliverance, surely yet to come. </l>
               <l>Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak </l>
               <l>A lasting inspiration, sanctified </l>
               <l>By reason, blest by faith: what we have loved, </l>
               <l>Others will love, and we will teach them how; </l>
               <l>Instruct them how the mind of man becomes </l>
               <l>A thousand times more beautiful than the earth </l>
               <l>On which he dwells, above this frame of things </l>
               <l>(Which, 'mid all revolution in the hopes </l>
               <l>And fears of men, doth still remain unchanged) </l>
               <l>In beauty exalted, as it is itself </l>
               <l>Of quality and fabric more divine. </l>
