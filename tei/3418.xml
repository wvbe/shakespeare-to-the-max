            <l>He turns aſide his face</l>
            <l>By pity touch'd and godlike grace:</l>
            <l>He calls BRITANNIA's guardian angel loud,</l>
            <l>Go, quell the ſanguine, and aſſuage the proud:</l>
            <l>Thy glorious lot on yonder orb below</l>
            <l>That globe ſhall rule, my laurel there ſhall grow;</l>

            <l>The gaſping ſoldier, and the guſhing wound,</l>
            <l>With human nature fainting on the ground.</l>
