               <l>SWIFT roll the Rhine's billows, and water the plains,</l>
               <l>Where Falkenstein Castle's majestic remains,</l>
               <l>Their moss-cover'd turrets still rear;</l>
               <l>Oft loves the gaunt wolf midst the ruins to prowl,</l>
               <l>What Time from the battlements pours the lone owl</l>
               <l>Her plaints in the passenger's ear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>No longer resound through the vaults of yon hall</l>
               <l>The song of the minstrel, and mirth of the ball;</l>
               <l>Those pleasures for ever are fled;</l>
               <l>There now dwells the bat with her light-shunning brood;</l>
               <l>There ravens and vultures now clamour for food,</l>
               <l>And all is dark, silent, and dread!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ha! Dost thou not see by the Moon's trembling light,</l>
               <l>Directing his steps, where advances a Knight,</l>
               <l>His eye big with vengeance and fate?</l>
               <l>'Tis Osric—the Lion, his Nephew who leads,</l>
               <l>And swift up the crackling old stair-case proceeds,</l>
               <l>Gains the hall, and quick closes the gate.</l>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0961600500:3"/>
               <l>Now round him young Carloman casting his eyes,</l>
               <l>Surveys the sad scene with dismay and surprize,</l>
               <l>And fear steals the rose from his cheeks;</l>
               <l>His spirits forsake him, his courage is flown;</l>
               <l>The hand of Sir Osric he clasps in his own,</l>
               <l>And while his voice falters he speaks:—</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Dear Uncle," he murmurs, "why linger we here?</l>
               <l>'Tis late, and these chambers are damp and are drear;</l>
               <l>Keen blows through the ruins the blast!</l>
               <l>Oh! let us away and our journey pursue;</l>
               <l>Fair Blumenberg's Castle will rise on our view,</l>
               <l>Soon as Falkenstein Forest is past.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Why roll thus your eye-balls? Why glare they so wild?</l>
               <l>Oh! chide not my weakness, nor frown, that a child</l>
               <l>Should view these apartments with dread;</l>
               <l>For know, that full oft have I heard from my Nurse,</l>
               <l>There still on this Castle has rested a curse,</l>
               <l>Since innocent blood here was shed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"She said, too, bad spirits, and ghosts all in white,</l>
               <l>Here use to resort at the dead time of night,</l>
               <l>Nor vanish till breaking of day;</l>
               <l>And still at their coming is heard the deep tone</l>
               <l>Of a bell—loud and awful—Hark! hark! 'twas a groan!</l>
               <l>Good Uncle, oh! let us away!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0961600500:4"/>
               <l>"Peace, serpent!" thus Osric—the Lion, replies,</l>
               <l>While rage and malignity gloom in his eyes;</l>
               <l>"Thy journey and life here must close:</l>
               <l>Thy Castle's proud turrets no more shalt thou see;</l>
               <l>No more betwixt Blumenberg's Lordship and me</l>
               <l>Shalt thou stand, and my greatness oppose.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"My Brother lies breathless on Palestine's plains,</l>
               <l>And though once remov'd, to his noble domains</l>
               <l>My right can no rival deny:</l>
               <l>Then, stripling, prepare on my dagger to bleed;</l>
               <l>No succour is near, and thy fate is decreed;</l>
               <l>Commend thee to Jesus, and die!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus saying, he seizes the boy by the arm,</l>
               <l>Whose grief rends the vaulted hall's roof, while alarm</l>
               <l>His heart of all fortitude robs:</l>
               <l>His limbs sink beneath him; distracted with fears,</l>
               <l>He falls at his Uncle's feet, bathes them with tears,</l>
               <l>And—"Spare me! Oh! spare me!" he sobs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ah! 'tis in vain that he strives to appease</l>
               <l>The miscreant; in vain does he cling round his knees,</l>
               <l>And sue in soft accents for life:</l>
               <l>Unmov'd by his sorrow—unmov'd by his pray'r,</l>
               <l>Fierce Osric has twisted his hand in his hair,</l>
               <l>And aims at his bosom a knife.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0961600500:5"/>
               <l>But e'er the steel blushes with blood, strange to tell!</l>
               <l>Self-struck, does the tongue of the hollow-ton'd bell</l>
               <l>The presence of midnight declare:</l>
               <l>And while, with amazement, his hair bristles high,</l>
               <l>Hears Osric a voice, loud and terrible, cry,</l>
               <l>In sounds heart appalling—"Forbear!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Straight curses and shrieks thro' the chambers resound,</l>
               <l>With hellish mirth mingled; the walls shake around;</l>
               <l>The groaning roof threatens to fall;</l>
               <l>Loud bellows the thunder; blue lightnings still flash;</l>
               <l>The casements they clatter; chains rattle; doors clash,</l>
               <l>And flames spread their waves through the hall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The clamour increases; the portals expand;</l>
               <l>O'er the pavement's black marble now rushes a band</l>
               <l>Of daemons all dropping with gore;</l>
               <l>In visage so grim, and so monstrous in height,</l>
               <l>That Carloman screams, as they burst on his sight,</l>
               <l>And sinks without sense on the floor.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Not so his fell Uncle: he sees that the throng</l>
               <l>Impels, loudly shrieking, a female along,</l>
               <l>And well the sad spectre he knows:</l>
               <l>The daemons with curses her steps onward urge;</l>
               <l>Her shoulders with whips form'd of serpents they scourge,</l>
               <l>And fast from her wounds the blood flows.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0961600500:6"/>
               <l>"Oh! welcome," she cry'd, and her voice spoke despair;</l>
               <l>Oh! welcome, Sir Osric, the torments to share,</l>
               <l>Of which thou hast made me the prey:</l>
               <l>Twelve years have I languish'd thy coming to see;</l>
               <l>Ulrilda, who perish'd dishonour'd by thee,</l>
               <l>Now calls thee to anguish away!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My ruin compleated, thy love became hate;</l>
               <l>Thy hand gave the draught which consign'd me to Fate;</l>
               <l>Nor thought I death lurk'd in the bowl;</l>
               <l>Unfit for the grave, stain'd with guilt, swell'd with pride,</l>
               <l>Unblest, unabsolv'd, unrepenting I dy'd,</l>
               <l>And daemons straight seiz'd on my soul!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Thou com'st, and with transport I feel my breast swell!</l>
               <l>Full long I have suffer'd the torments of hell,</l>
               <l>And now shall its pleasures be mine!</l>
               <l>See, see, how the fiends are athirst for thy blood!</l>
               <l>Twelve years has my panting heart furnish'd their food,</l>
               <l>Come, wretch, let them feast upon thine!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She said, and the daemons their prey flock'd around;</l>
               <l>They dash'd him with horrible yell on the ground,</l>
               <l>And blood down his limbs trickl'd fast:</l>
               <l>His eyes from their sockets with fury they tore;</l>
               <l>They fed on his entrails, all reeking with gore,</l>
               <l>And his heart was Ulrilda's repast.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0961600500:7"/>
               <l>But now the grey cock told the coming of day;</l>
               <l>The fiends with their victim straight vanish'd away,</l>
               <l>And Carloman's heart throbb'd again:</l>
               <l>With terror recalling the deeds of the night,</l>
               <l>He rose, and from Falkenstein speeding his flight,</l>
               <l>Soon reach'd his paternal domain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Since then all with horror the ruins behold;</l>
               <l>No shepherd, though stray'd be a lamb from his fold,</l>
               <l>No mother, though lost be her child,</l>
               <l>The fugitive dares in these chambers to seek,</l>
               <l>Where fiends nightly revel, and guilty ghosts shriek,</l>
               <l>In accents most fearful and wild!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh! shun them, ye pilgrims, tho' late be the hour,</l>
               <l>Tho' loud howl the tempest, and fast fall the show'r,</l>
               <l>From Falkenstein Castle be gone!</l>
               <l>There still their said banquet Hell's denizens share;</l>
               <l>There Osric—the Lion, still raves in despair;</l>
               <l>Breathe a prayer for his soul, and pass on!</l>
