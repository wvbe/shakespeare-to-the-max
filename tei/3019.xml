               <head>THE SONG OF THE HAPPY SHEPHERD</head>
               <l>THE woods of Arcady are dead,</l>
               <l>And over is their antique joy;</l>
               <l>Of old the world on dreaming fed;</l>
               <l>Grey Truth is now her painted toy;</l>
               <l>Yet still she turns her restless head:</l>
               <l>But O, sick children of the world,</l>
               <l>Of all the many changing things</l>
               <l>In dreary dancing past us whirled,</l>
               <l>To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,</l>
               <l>Words alone are certain good.</l>
               <l>Where are now the warring kings,</l>
               <l>Word be-mockers? — By the Rood,</l>
               <l>Where are now the watring kings?</l>
               <l>An idle word is now their glory,</l>
               <l>By the stammering schoolboy said,</l>
               <l>Reading some entangled story:</l>
               <l>The kings of the old time are dead;</l>
               <l>The wandering earth herself may be</l>
               <l>Only a sudden flaming word,</l>
               <l>In clanging space a moment heard,</l>
               <l>Troubling the endless reverie.</l>
               <l>Then nowise worship dusty deeds,</l>
               <l>Nor seek, for this is also sooth,</l>
               <l>To hunger fiercely after truth,</l>
               <l>Lest all thy toiling only breeds</l>
               <l>New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth</l>
               <l>Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,</l>
               <l>No learning from the starry men,</l>
               <l>Who follow with the optic glass</l>
               <l>The whirling ways of stars that pass — </l>
               <l>Seek, then, for this is also sooth,</l>
               <l>No word of theirs — the cold star-bane</l>
               <l>Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,</l>
               <l>And dead is all their human truth.</l>
               <l>Go gather by the humming sea</l>
               <l>Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell.</l>
               <l>And to its lips thy story tell,</l>
               <l>And they thy comforters will be.</l>
               <l>Rewording in melodious guile</l>
               <l>Thy fretful words a little while,</l>
               <l>Till they shall singing fade in ruth</l>
               <l>And die a pearly brotherhood;</l>
               <l>For words alone are certain good:</l>
               <l>Sing, then, for this is also sooth.</l>
               <l>I must be gone: there is a grave</l>
               <l>Where daffodil and lily wave,</l>
               <l>And I would please the hapless faun,</l>
               <l>Buried under the sleepy ground,</l>
               <l>With mirthful songs before the dawn.</l>
               <l>His shouting days with mirth were crowned;</l>
               <l>And still I dream he treads the lawn,</l>
               <l>Walking ghostly in the dew,</l>
               <l>Pierced by my glad singing through,</l>
               <l>My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:</l>
               <l>But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!</l>
               <l>For fair are poppies on the brow:</l>
               <l>Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.</l>

               <head>THE SAD SHEPHERD</head>
               <l>THERE was a man whom Sorrow named his Friend,</l>
               <l>And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,</l>
               <l>Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming</l>
               <l>And humming Sands, where windy surges wend:</l>
               <l>And he called loudly to the stars to bend</l>
               <l>From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they</l>
               <l>Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:</l>
               <l>And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend</l>
               <l>Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story.!</l>
               <l>The sea Swept on and cried her old cry still,</l>
               <l>Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.</l>
               <l>He fled the persecution of her glory</l>
               <l>And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,</l>
               <l>Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.</l>
               <l>But naught they heard, for they are always listening,</l>
               <l>The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.</l>
               <l>And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend</l>
               <l>Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,</l>
               <l>And thought, I will my heavy story tell</l>
               <l>Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send</l>
               <l>Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;</l>
               <l>And my own talc again for me shall sing,</l>
               <l>And my own whispering words be comforting,</l>
               <l>And lo! my ancient burden may depart.</l>
               <l>Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;</l>
               <l>But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone</l>
               <l>Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan</l>
               <l>Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.</l>

               <l>"I make the cloak of Sorrow:</l>
               <l>O lovely to see in all men's sight</l>

               <head>ANASHUYA AND VIJAYA</head>
               <l>A little Indian temple in the Golden Age. Around it a
garden;</l>
               <l>around that the forest. Anashuya, the young priestess, kneelinq</l>
               <l>within the temple.</l>
               <l>Anashuya. Send peace on all the lands and flickering</l>
               <l>corn. — </l>
               <l>O, may tranquillity walk by his elbow</l>
               <l>When wandering in the forest, if he love</l>
               <l>No other. — Hear, and may the indolent flocks</l>
               <l>Be plentiful. — And if he love another,</l>
               <l>May panthers end him. — Hear, and load our king</l>
               <l>With wisdom hour by hour. — May we two stand,</l>
               <l>When we are dead, beyond the setting suns,</l>
               <l>A little from the other shades apart,</l>
               <l>With mingling hair, and play upon one lute.</l>
               <l>Vijaya [entering and throwing a lily at her]. Hail! hail, my</l>
               <l>Anashuya.</l>
               <l>Anashuya. No: be still.</l>
               <l>I, priestess of this temple, offer up</l>
               <l>prayers for the land.</l>
               <l>Vijaya. I will wait here, Amrita.</l>
               <l>Anashuya. By mighty Brahma's ever-rustling robe,</l>
               <l>Who is Amrita? Sorrow of all sorrows!</l>
               <l>Another fills your mind.</l>
               <l>Vijaya. My mother's name.</l>
               <l>Anashuya [sings, coming out of the temple].</l>
               <l>A sad, sad thought went by me slowly:</l>
               <l>Sigh, O you little stars.! O sigh and shake your blue</l>
               <l>apparel.!</l>
               <l>The sad, sad thought has gone from me now wholly:</l>
               <l>Sing, O you little stars.! O sing and raise your
rapturous</l>
               <l>carol</l>
               <l>To mighty Brahma, be who made you many as the
sands,</l>
               <l>And laid you on the gates of evening with his quiet
hands.</l>
               <l>(Sits down on the steps of the temple.j</l>
               <l>Vijaya, I have brought my evening rice;</l>
               <l>The sun has laid his chin on the grey wood,</l>
               <l>Weary, with all his poppies gathered round him.</l>
               <l>Vijaya. The hour when Kama, full of sleepy laughter,</l>
               <l>Rises, and showers abroad his fragrant arrows,</l>
               <l>Piercing the twilight with their murmuring barbs.</l>
               <l>Anashuya. See-how the sacred old flamingoes come.</l>
               <l>Painting with shadow all the marble steps:</l>
               <l>Aged and wise, they seek their wonted perches</l>
               <l>Within the temple, devious walking, made</l>
               <l>To wander by their melancholy minds.</l>
               <l>Yon tall one eyes my supper; chase him away,</l>
               <l>Far, far away. I named him after you.</l>
               <l>He is a famous fisher; hour by hour</l>
               <l>He ruffles with his bill the minnowed streams.</l>
               <l>Ah! there he snaps my rice. I told you so.</l>
               <l>Now cuff him off. He's off! A kiss for you,</l>
               <l>Because you saved my rice. Have you no thanks?</l>
               <l>Vijaya [sings]. Sing you of her, O first few stars,</l>
               <l>Whom Brahma, touching with his finger, praises, for you</l>
               <l>hold</l>
               <l>The van of wandering quiet; ere you be too calm and old,</l>
               <l>Sing, turning in your cars,</l>
               <l>Sing, till you raise your hands and sigh, and from your car-</l>
               <l>heads peer,</l>
               <l>With all your whirling hair, and drop many an azure tear.</l>
               <l>Anashuya. What know the pilots of the stars of tears?</l>
               <l>Vijaya. Their faces are all worn, and in their eyes</l>
               <l>Flashes the fire of sadness, for they see</l>
               <l>The icicles that famish all the North,</l>
               <l>Where men lie frozen in the glimmering snow;</l>
               <l>And in the flaming forests cower the lion</l>
               <l>And lioness, with all their whimpering cubs;</l>
               <l>And, ever pacing on the verge of things,</l>
               <l>The phantom, Beauty, in a mist of tears;</l>
               <l>While we alone have round us woven woods,</l>
               <l>And feel the softness of each other's hand,</l>
               <l>Amrita, while — -</l>
               <l>Anashuya [going away from him].</l>
               <l>Ah me! you love another,</l>
               <l>[Bursting into tears.]</l>
               <l>And may some sudden dreadful ill befall her!</l>
               <l>Vijaya. I loved another; now I love no other.</l>
               <l>Among the mouldering of ancient woods</l>
               <l>You live, and on the village border she,</l>
               <l>With her old father the blind wood-cutter;</l>
               <l>I saw her standing in her door but now.</l>
               <l>Anashuya. Vijaya, swear to love her never more.</l>
               <l>Vijaya. Ay, ay.</l>
               <l>Anashuya. Swear by the parents of the gods,</l>
               <l>Dread oath, who dwell on sacred Himalay,</l>
               <l>On the far Golden peak; enormous shapes,</l>
               <l>Who still were old when the great sea was young;</l>
               <l>On their vast faces mystery and dreams;</l>
               <l>Their hair along the mountains rolled and filled</l>
               <l>From year to year by the unnumbered nests</l>
               <l>Of aweless birds, and round their stirless feet</l>
               <l>The joyous flocks of deer and antelope,</l>
               <l>Who never hear the unforgiving hound.</l>
               <l>Swear!</l>
               <l>Vijaya. By the parents of the gods, I swear.</l>
               <l>Anashuya [sings]. I have forgiven, O new star!</l>
               <l>Maybe you have not heard of us, you have come forth so</l>
               <l>newly,</l>
               <l>You hunter of the fields afar!</l>
               <l>Ah, you will know my loved one by his hunter's arrows</l>
               <l>truly,</l>
               <l>Shoot on him shafts of quietness, that he may ever keep</l>
               <l>A lonely laughter, and may kiss his hands to me in sleep.</l>
               <l>Farewell, Vijaya. Nay, no word, no word;</l>
               <l>I, priestess of this temple, offer up</l>
               <l>Prayers for the land.</l>
               <l>[Vijaya goes.]</l>

               <head>THE INDIAN UPON GOD</head>
               <l>I PASSED along the water's edge below the humid trees,</l>
               <l>My spirit rocked in evening light, the rushes round my</l>
               <l>knees,</l>
               <l>My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moor-</l>
               <l>fowl pace</l>
               <l>All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to</l>
               <l>chase</l>
               <l>Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest speak:</l>
               <l>Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or</l>
               <l>weak</l>
               <l>Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky.</l>
               <l>The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from</l>
               <l>His eye.</l>
               <l>I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk:</l>
               <l>Who made the world and ruleth it, He hangeth on a stalk,</l>
               <l>For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide</l>
               <l>Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide.</l>
               <l>A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes</l>
               <l>Brimful of starlight, and he said: The Stamper of the</l>
               <l>Skies,</l>
               <l>He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could
He</l>
               <l>Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me?</l>
               <l>I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say:</l>
               <l>Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers</l>
               <l>gay,</l>
               <l>He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night</l>
               <l>His languid tail above us, lit with myriad spots of light.</l>

               <l>"YOUR eyes that once were never weary of mine</l>

               <head>THE MADNESS OF KING GOLL</head>
               <l>I SAT on cushioned otter-skin:</l>
               <l>My word was law from Ith to Emain,</l>
               <l>And shook at Inver Amergin</l>
               <l>The hearts of the world-troubling seamen,</l>
               <l>And drove tumult and war away</l>
               <l>From girl and boy and man and beast;</l>
               <l>The fields grew fatter day by day,</l>
               <l>The wild fowl of the air increased;</l>
               <l>And every ancient Ollave said,</l>
               <l>While he bent down his fading head.</l>
               <l>"He drives away the Northern cold.'</l>
               <l>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</l>
               <l>I sat and mused and drank sweet wine;</l>
               <l>A herdsman came from inland valleys,</l>
               <l>Crying, the pirates drove his swine</l>
               <l>To fill their dark-beaked hollow galleys.</l>
               <l>I called my battle-breaking men</l>
               <l>And my loud brazen battle-cars</l>
               <l>From rolling vale and rivery glen;</l>
               <l>And under the blinking of the stars</l>
               <l>Fell on the pirates by the deep,</l>
               <l>And hurled them in the gulph of sleep:</l>
               <l>These hands won many a torque of gold.</l>
               <l>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech
leaves old.</l>
               <l>But slowly, as I shouting slew</l>
               <l>And trampled in the bubbling mire,</l>
               <l>In my most secret spirit grew</l>
               <l>A whirling and a wandering fire:</l>
               <l>I stood: keen stars above me shone,</l>
               <l>Around me shone keen eyes of men:</l>
               <l>I laughed aloud and hurried on</l>
               <l>By rocky shore and rushy fen;</l>
               <l>I laughed because birds fluttered by,</l>
               <l>And starlight gleamed, and clouds flew high,</l>
               <l>And rushes waved and waters rolled.</l>
               <l>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech
leaves old.</l>
               <l>And now I wander in the woods</l>
               <l>When summer gluts the golden bees,</l>
               <l>Or in autumnal solitudes</l>
               <l>Arise the leopard-coloured trees;</l>
               <l>Or when along the wintry strands</l>
               <l>The cormorants shiver on their rocks;</l>
               <l>I wander on, and wave my hands,</l>
               <l>And sing, and shake my heavy locks.</l>
               <l>The grey wolf knows me; by one ear</l>
               <l>I lead along the woodland deer;</l>
               <l>The hares run by me growing bold.</l>
               <l>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the Beech
leaves old.</l>
               <l>I came upon a little town</l>
               <l>That slumbered in the harvest moon,</l>
               <l>And passed a-tiptoe up and down,</l>
               <l>Murmuring, to a fitful tune,</l>
               <l>How I have followed, night and day,</l>
               <l>A tramping of tremendous feet,</l>
               <l>And saw where this old tympan lay</l>
               <l>Deserted on a doorway seat,</l>
               <l>And bore it to the woods with me;</l>
               <l>Of some inhuman misery</l>
               <l>Our married voices wildly trolled.</l>
               <l>They will not hush, ta leaves a-flutter round me, the beech
leaves old.</l>
               <l>I sang how, when day's toil is done,</l>
               <l>Orchil shakes out her long dark hair</l>
               <l>That hides away the dying sun</l>
               <l>And sheds faint odours through the air:</l>
               <l>When my hand passed from wire to wire</l>
               <l>It quenched, with sound like falling dew</l>
               <l>The whirling and the wandering fire;</l>
               <l>But lift a mournful ulalu,</l>
               <l>For the kind wires are torn and still,</l>
               <l>And I must wander wood and hill</l>
               <l>Through summer's heat and winter's cold.</l>
               <l>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech
leaves old.</l>

               <l>GOOD Father John O'Hart</l>
               <l>In penal days rode out</l>
               <l>To a Shoneen who had free lands</l>
               <l>And his own snipe and trout.</l>
               <l>In trust took he John's lands;</l>
               <l>Sleiveens were all his race;</l>
               <l>And he gave them as dowers to his daughters.</l>
               <l>And they married beyond their place.</l>
               <l>But Father John went up,</l>
               <l>And Father John went down;</l>
               <l>And he wore small holes in his Shoes,</l>
               <l>And he wore large holes in his gown.</l>
               <l>All loved him, only the shoneen,</l>
               <l>Whom the devils have by the hair,</l>
               <l>From the wives, and the cats, and the children,</l>
               <l>To the birds in the white of the air.</l>
               <l>The birds, for he opened their cages</l>
               <l>As he went up and down;</l>
               <l>And he said with a smile, "Have peace now';</l>
               <l>And he went his way with a frown.</l>
               <l>But if when anyone died</l>
               <l>Came keeners hoarser than rooks,</l>
               <l>He bade them give over their keening;</l>
               <l>For he was a man of books.</l>

               <l>Ye little childer dear,</l>
               <l>I looked on my cold baby</l>
               <l>When the morn grew frosty and clear.</l>
               <l>A weary woman sleeps so hard!</l>
               <l>My man grew red and pale,</l>
               <l>And gave me money, and bade me go</l>

               <l>I went away in silence,</l>

               <l>The windows and the doors were shut,</l>
               <l>One star shone faint and green,</l>

            <l>wintry mould,</l>
            <l>Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the</l>
            <l>deeps of my heart.</l>
            <l>The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great</l>
            <l>to be told;</l>
            <l>I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll</l>
            <l>apart,</l>
            <l>With the earth and the sky and the water, re-made, like</l>
            <l>a casket of gold</l>
            <l>For my dreams of your image that blossoms a rose in</l>
            <l>the deeps of my heart.</l>
            <l>THE HOST OF THE AIR</l>
            <l>O'DRISCOLL drove with a song</l>
            <l>The wild duck and the drake</l>
            <l>From the tall and the tufted reeds</l>
            <l>Of the drear Hart Lake.</l>
            <l>And he saw how the reeds grew dark</l>
            <l>At the coming of night-tide,</l>
            <l>And dreamed of the long dim hair</l>
            <l>Of Bridget his bride.</l>
            <l>He heard while he sang and dreamed</l>
            <l>A piper piping away,</l>
            <l>And never was piping so sad,</l>
            <l>And never was piping so gay.</l>
            <l>And he saw young men and young girls</l>
            <l>Who danced on a level place,</l>
            <l>And Bridget his bride among them,</l>
            <l>With a sad and a gay face.</l>
            <l>The dancers crowded about him</l>
            <l>And many a sweet thing said,</l>
            <l>And a young man brought him red wine</l>
            <l>And a young girl white bread.</l>
            <l>But Bridget drew him by the sleeve</l>
            <l>Away from the merry bands,</l>
            <l>To old men playing at cards</l>
            <l>With a twinkling of ancient hands.</l>
            <l>The bread and the wine had a doom,</l>
            <l>For these were the host of the air;</l>
            <l>He sat and played in a dream</l>
            <l>Of her long dim hair.</l>
            <l>He played with the merry old men</l>
            <l>And thought not of evil chance,</l>
            <l>Until one bore Bridget his bride</l>
            <l>Away from the merry dance.</l>
            <l>He bore her away in his atms,</l>
            <l>The handsomest young man there,</l>
            <l>And his neck and his breast and his arms</l>
            <l>Were drowned in her long dim hair.</l>
            <l>O'Driscoll scattered the cards</l>
            <l>And out of his dream awoke:</l>
            <l>Old men and young men and young girls</l>
            <l>Were gone like a drifting smoke;</l>
            <l>But he heard high up in the air</l>
            <l>A piper piping away,</l>
            <l>And never was piping so sad,</l>
            <l>And never was piping so gay.</l>
            <l>THE FISH</l>
            <l>ALTHOUGH you hide in the ebb and flow</l>
            <l>Of the pale tide when the moon has set,</l>
            <l>The people of coming days will know</l>
            <l>About the casting out of my net,</l>
            <l>And how you have leaped times out of mind</l>
            <l>Over the little silver cords,</l>
            <l>And think that you were hard and unkind,</l>
            <l>And blame you with many bitter words.</l>
            <l>THE UNAPPEASABLE HOST</l>
            <l>THE Danaan children laugh, in cradles of wrought gold,</l>
            <l>And clap their hands together, and half close their eyes,</l>
            <l>For they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies,</l>
            <l>With heavy whitening wings, and a heart fallen cold:</l>
            <l>I kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast,</l>
            <l>And hear the narrow graves calling my child and me.</l>
            <l>Desolate winds that cry over the wandering sea;</l>
            <l>Desolate winds that hover in the flaming West;</l>
            <l>Desolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven, and beat</l>
            <l>The doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering</l>
            <l>ghost;</l>
            <l>O heart the winds have shaken, the unappeasable host</l>
            <l>Is comelier than candles at Mother Mary's feet.</l>
            <l>INTO THE TWILIGHT</l>
            <l>OUT-WORN heart, in a time out-worn,</l>
            <l>Come clear of the nets of wrong and right;</l>
            <l>Laugh, heart, again in the grey twilight,</l>
            <l>Sigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.</l>
            <l>Your mother Eire is aways young,</l>
            <l>Dew ever shining and twilight grey;</l>
            <l>Though hope fall from you and love decay,</l>
            <l>Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue.</l>
            <l>Come, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill:</l>
            <l>For there the mystical brotherhood</l>
            <l>Of sun and moon and hollow and wood</l>
            <l>And river and stream work out their will;</l>
            <l>And God stands winding His lonely horn,</l>
            <l>And time and the world are ever in flight;</l>
            <l>And love is less kind than the grey twilight,</l>
            <l>And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.</l>
            <l>THE SONG OF WANDERING AENGUS</l>
            <l>I WENT out to the hazel wood,</l>
            <l>Because a fire was in my head,</l>
            <l>And cut and peeled a hazel wand,</l>
            <l>And hooked a berry to a thread;</l>
            <l>And when white moths were on the wing,</l>
            <l>And moth-like stars were flickering out,</l>
            <l>I dropped the berry in a stream</l>
            <l>And caught a little silver trout.</l>
            <l>When I had laid it on the floor</l>
            <l>I went to blow the fire aflame,</l>
            <l>But something rustled on the floor,</l>
            <l>And some one called me by my name:</l>
            <l>It had become a glimmering girl</l>
            <l>With apple blossom in her hair</l>
            <l>Who called me by my name and ran</l>
            <l>And faded through the brightening air.</l>
            <l>Though I am old with wandering</l>
            <l>Through hollow lads and hilly lands.</l>
            <l>I will find out where she has gone,</l>
            <l>And kiss her lips and take her hands;</l>
            <l>And walk among long dappled grass,</l>
            <l>And pluck till time and times are done</l>
            <l>The silver apples of the moon,</l>
            <l>The golden apples of the sun.</l>
            <l>THE SONG OF THE OLD MOTHER</l>
            <l>I RISE in the dawn, and I kneel and blow</l>
            <l>Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;</l>
            <l>And then I must scrub and bake and sweep</l>
            <l>Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;</l>
            <l>And the young lie long and dream in their bed</l>
            <l>Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,</l>
            <l>And their ~y goes over in idleness,</l>
            <l>And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:</l>
            <l>While I must work because I am old,</l>
            <l>And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.</l>
            <l>THE HEART OF THE WOMAN</l>
            <l>O WHAT to me the little room</l>
            <l>That was brimmed up with prayer and rest;</l>
            <l>He bade me out into the gloom,</l>
            <l>And my breast lies upon his breast.</l>
            <l>O what to me my mother's care,</l>
            <l>The house where I was safe and warm;</l>
            <l>The shadowy blossom of my hair</l>
            <l>Will hide us from the bitter storm.</l>
            <l>O hiding hair and dewy eyes,</l>
            <l>I am no more with life and death,</l>
            <l>My heart upon his warm heart lies,</l>
            <l>My breath is mixed into his breath.</l>
            <l>THE LOVER MOURNS FOR THE LOSS OF LOVE</l>
            <l>PALE brows, still hands and dim hair,</l>
            <l>I had a beautiful friend</l>
            <l>And dreamed that the old despair</l>
            <l>Would end in love in the end:</l>
            <l>She looked in my heart one day</l>
            <l>And saw your image was there;</l>
            <l>She has gone weeping away.</l>
            <l>HE MOURNS FOR THE CHANGE THAT HAS COME</l>
            <l>UPON HIM AND HIS BELOVED, AND LONGS FOR</l>
            <l>THE END OF THE WORLD</l>
            <l>DO you not hear me calling, white deer with no horns?</l>
            <l>I have been changed to a hound with one red ear;</l>
            <l>I have been in the Path of Stones and the Wood of</l>
            <l>Thorns,</l>
            <l>For somebody hid hatred and hope and desire and fear</l>
            <l>Under my feet that they follow you night and day.</l>
            <l>A man with a hazel wand came without sound;</l>
            <l>He changed me suddenly; I was looking another way;</l>
            <l>And now my calling is but the calling of a hound;</l>
            <l>And Time and Birth and Change are hurrying by.</l>
            <l>I would that the Boar without bristles had come from</l>
            <l>the West</l>
            <l>And had rooted the sun and moon and stars out of the sky</l>
            <l>And lay in the darkness, grunting, and turning to his rest.</l>
            <l>HE BIDS HIS BELOVED BE AT PEACE</l>
            <l>I HEAR the Shadowy Horses, their long manes a-shake,</l>
            <l>Their hoofs heavy with tumult, their eyes glimmering</l>
            <l>white;</l>
            <l>The North unfolds above them clinging, creeping</l>
            <l>night,</l>
            <l>The East her hidden joy before the morning break,</l>
            <l>The West weeps in pale dew and sighs passing away,</l>
            <l>The South is pouring down roses of crimson fire:</l>
            <l>O vanity of Sleep, Hope, Dream, endless Desire,</l>
            <l>The Horses of Disaster plunge in the heavy clay:</l>
            <l>Beloved, let your eyes half close, and your heart beat</l>
            <l>Over my heart, and your hair fall over my breast,</l>
            <l>Drowning love's lonely hour in deep twilight of rest,</l>
            <l>And hiding their tossing manes and their tumultuous</l>
            <l>feet.</l>
            <l>HE REPROVES THE CURLEW</l>
            <l>O CURLEW, cry no more in the air,</l>
            <l>Or only to the water in the West;</l>
            <l>Because your crying brings to my mind</l>
            <l>passion-dimmed eyes and long heavy hair</l>
            <l>That was shaken out over my breast:</l>
            <l>There is enough evil in the crying of wind.</l>
            <l>HE REMEMBERS FORGOTTEN BEAUTY</l>
            <l>WHEN my arms wrap you round I press</l>
            <l>My heart upon the loveliness</l>
            <l>That has long faded from the world;</l>
            <l>The jewelled crowns that kings have hurled</l>
            <l>In shadowy pools, when armies fled;</l>
            <l>The love-tales wrought with silken thread</l>
            <l>By dreaming ladies upon cloth</l>
            <l>That has made fat the murderous moth;</l>
            <l>The roses that of old time were</l>
            <l>Woven by ladies in their hair,</l>
            <l>The dew-cold lilies ladies bore</l>
            <l>Through many a sacred corridor</l>
            <l>Where such grey clouds of incense rose</l>
            <l>That only God's eyes did not close:</l>
            <l>For that pale breast and lingering hand</l>
            <l>Come from a more dream-heavy land,</l>
            <l>A more dream-heavy hour than this;</l>
            <l>And when you sigh from kiss to kiss</l>
            <l>I hear white Beauty sighing, too,</l>
            <l>For hours when all must fade like dew.</l>
            <l>But flame on flame, and deep on deep,</l>
            <l>Throne over throne where in half sleep,</l>
            <l>Their swords upon their iron knees,</l>
            <l>Brood her high lonely mysteries.</l>
            <l>A POET TO HIS BELOVED</l>
            <l>I BRING you with reverent hands</l>
            <l>The books of my numberless dreams,</l>
            <l>White woman that passion has worn</l>
            <l>As the tide wears the dove-grey sands,</l>
            <l>And with heart more old than the horn</l>
            <l>That is brimmed from the pale fire of time:</l>
            <l>White woman with numberless dreams,</l>
            <l>I bring you my passionate rhyme.</l>
            <l>HE GIVES HIS BELOVED CERTAIN RHYMES</l>
            <l>FASTEN your hair with a golden pin,</l>
            <l>And bind up every wandering tress;</l>
            <l>I bade my heart build these poor rhymes:</l>
            <l>It worked at them, day out, day in,</l>
            <l>Building a sorrowful loveliness</l>
            <l>Out of the battles of old times.</l>
            <l>You need but lift a pearl-pale hand,</l>
            <l>And bind up your long hair and sigh;</l>
            <l>And all men's hearts must burn and beat;</l>
            <l>And candle-like foam on the dim sand,</l>
            <l>And stars climbing the dew-dropping sky,</l>
            <l>Live but to light your passing feet.</l>
            <l>TO HIS HEART, BIDDING IT HAVE NO FEAR</l>
            <l>BE you still, be you still, trembling heart;</l>
            <l>Remember the wisdom out of the old days:</l>
            <l>Him who trembles before the flame and the flood,</l>
            <l>And the winds that blow through the starry ways,</l>
            <l>Let the starry winds and the flame and the flood</l>
            <l>Cover over and hide, for he has no part</l>
            <l>With the lonely, majestical multitude.</l>
            <l>THE CAP AND BELLS</l>
            <l>THE jester walked in the garden:</l>
            <l>The garden had fallen still;</l>
            <l>He bade his soul rise upward</l>
            <l>And stand on her window-sill.</l>
            <l>It rose in a straight blue garment,</l>
            <l>When owls began to call:</l>
            <l>It had grown wise-tongued by thinking</l>
            <l>Of a quiet and light footfall;</l>
            <l>But the young queen would not listen;</l>
            <l>She rose in her pale night-gown;</l>
            <l>She drew in the heavy casement</l>
            <l>And pushed the latches down.</l>
            <l>He bade his heart go to her,</l>
            <l>When the owls called out no more;</l>
            <l>In a red and quivering garment</l>
            <l>It sang to her through the door.</l>
            <l>It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming</l>
            <l>Of a flutter of flower-like hair;</l>
            <l>But she took up her fan from the table</l>
            <l>And waved it off on the air.</l>
            <l>"I have cap and bells,' he pondered,</l>
            <l>"I will send them to her and die';</l>
            <l>And when the morning whitened</l>
            <l>He left them where she went by.</l>
            <l>She laid them upon her bosom,</l>
            <l>Under a cloud of her hair,</l>
            <l>And her red lips sang them a love-song</l>
            <l>Till stars grew out of the air.</l>
            <l>She opened her door and her window,</l>
            <l>And the heart and the soul came through,</l>
            <l>To her right hand came the red one,</l>
            <l>To her left hand came the blue.</l>
            <l>They set up a noise like crickets,</l>
            <l>A chattering wise and sweet,</l>
            <l>And her hair was a folded flower</l>
            <l>And the quiet of love in her feet.</l>
            <l>THE VALLEY OF THE BLACK PIG</l>
            <l>THE dews drop slowly and dreams gather: unknown</l>
            <l>spears</l>
            <l>Suddenly hurtle before my dream-awakened eyes,</l>
            <l>And then the clash of fallen horsemen and the cries</l>
            <l>Of unknown perishing armies beat about my ears.</l>
            <l>We who still labour by the cromlech on the shore,</l>
            <l>The grey caim on the hill, when day sinks drowned in</l>
            <l>dew,</l>
            <l>Being weary of the world's empires, bow down to you.</l>
            <l>Master of the still stars and of the flaming door.</l>
            <l>THE LOVER ASKS FORGIVENESS BECAUSE OF</l>
            <l>HIS MANY MOODS</l>
            <l>IF this importunate heart trouble your peace</l>
            <l>With words lighter than air,</l>
            <l>Or hopes that in mere hoping flicker and cease;</l>
            <l>Crumple the rose in your hair;</l>
            <l>And cover your lips with odorous twilight and say,</l>
            <l>"O Hearts of wind-blown flame!</l>
            <l>O Winds, older than changing of night and day,</l>
            <l>That murmuring and longing came</l>
            <l>From marble cities loud with tabors of old</l>
            <l>In dove-grey faery lands;</l>
            <l>From battle-banners, fold upon purple fold,</l>
            <l>Queens wrought with glimmering hands;</l>
            <l>That saw young Niamh hover with love-lorn face</l>
            <l>Above the wandering tide;</l>
            <l>And lingered in the hidden desolate place</l>
            <l>Where the last Phoenix died,</l>
            <l>And wrapped the flames above his holy head;</l>
            <l>And still murmur and long:</l>
            <l>O piteous Hearts, changing till change be dead</l>
            <l>In a tumultuous song':</l>
            <l>And cover the pale blossoms of your breast</l>
            <l>With your dim heavy hair,</l>
            <l>And trouble with a sigh for all things longing for rest</l>
            <l>The odorous twilight there.</l>
            <l>HE TELLS OF A VALLEY FULL OF LOVERS</l>
            <l>I DREAMED that I stood in a valley, and amid sighs,</l>
            <l>For happy lovers passed two by two where I stood;</l>
            <l>And I dreamed my lost love came stealthily out of the</l>
            <l>wood</l>
            <l>With her cloud-pale eyelids falling on dream-dimmed</l>
            <l>eyes:</l>
            <l>I cried in my dream, O women, bid the young men lay</l>
            <l>Their heads on your knees, and drown their eyes with your fair,</l>
            <l>Or remembering hers they will find no other face fair</l>
            <l>Till all the valleys of the world have been withered away.</l>
            <l>HE TELLS OF THE PERFECT BEAUTY</l>
            <l>O CLOUD-PALE eyelids, dream-dimmed eyes,</l>
            <l>The poets labouring all their days</l>
            <l>To build a perfect beauty in rhyme</l>
            <l>Are overthrown by a woman's gaze</l>
            <l>And by the unlabouring brood of the skies:</l>
            <l>And therefore my heart will bow, when dew</l>
            <l>Is dropping sleep, until God burn time,</l>
            <l>Before the unlabouring stars and you.</l>
            <l>HE HEARS THE CRY OF THE SEDGE</l>
            <l>I WANDER by the edge</l>
            <l>Of this desolate lake</l>
            <l>Where wind cries in the sedge:</l>
            <l>Until the axle break</l>
            <l>That keeps the stars in their round,</l>
            <l>And hands hurl in the deep</l>
            <l>The banners of East and West,</l>
            <l>And the girdle of light is unhound,</l>
            <l>Your breast will not lie by the breast</l>
            <l>Of your beloved in sleep.</l>
            <l>HE THINKS OF THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN</l>
            <l>EVIL OF HIS BELOVED</l>
            <l>HALF close your eyelids, loosen your hair,</l>
            <l>And dream about the great and their pride;</l>
            <l>They have spoken against you everywhere,</l>
            <l>But weigh this song with the great and their pride;</l>
            <l>I made it out of a mouthful of air,</l>
            <l>Their children's children shall say they have lied.</l>
            <l>THE BLESSED</l>
            <l>CUMHAL called out, bending his head,</l>
            <l>Till Dathi came and stood,</l>
            <l>With a blink in his eyes, at the cave-mouth,</l>
            <l>Between the wind and the wood.</l>
            <l>And Cumhal said, bending his knees,</l>
            <l>"I have come by the windy way</l>
            <l>And learn to pray when you pray.</l>
            <l>"I can bring you salmon out of the streams</l>
            <l>And heron out of the skies.'</l>
            <l>But Dathi folded his hands and smiled</l>
            <l>With the secrets of God in his eyes.</l>
            <l>And Cumhal saw like a drifting smoke</l>
            <l>All manner of blessed souls,</l>
            <l>Women and children, young men with books,</l>
            <l>And old men with croziers and stoles.</l>
            <l>"praise God and God's Mother,' Dathi said,</l>
            <l>"For God and God's Mother have sent</l>
            <l>The blessedest souls that walk in the world</l>
            <l>To fill your heart with content.'</l>
            <l>"And which is the blessedest,' Cumhal said,</l>
            <l>"Where all are comely and good?</l>
            <l>Is it these that with golden thuribles</l>
            <l>Are singing about the wood?'</l>
            <l>"My eyes are blinking,' Dathi said,</l>
            <l>"With the secrets of God half blind,</l>
            <l>But I can see where the wind goes</l>
            <l>And follow the way of the wind;</l>
            <l>"And blessedness goes where the wind goes,</l>
            <l>And when it is gone we are dead;</l>
            <l>I see the blessedest soul in the world</l>
            <l>And he nods a drunken head.</l>
            <l>"O blessedness comes in the night and the day</l>
            <l>And whither the wise heart knows;</l>
            <l>And one has seen in the redness of wine</l>
            <l>The Incorruptible Rose,</l>
            <l>"That drowsily drops faint leaves on him</l>
            <l>And the sweetness of desire,</l>
            <l>While time and the world are ebbing away</l>
            <l>In twilights of dew and of fire.'</l>
            <l>THE SECRET ROSE</l>
            <l>FAR-OFF, most secret, and inviolate Rose,</l>
            <l>Enfold me in my hour of hours; where those</l>
            <l>Who sought thee in the Holy Sepulchre,</l>
            <l>Or in the wine-vat, dwell beyond the stir</l>
            <l>And tumult of defeated dreams; and deep</l>
            <l>Among pale eyelids, heavy with the sleep</l>
            <l>Men have named beauty. Thy great leaves enfold</l>
            <l>The ancient beards, the helms of ruby and gold</l>
            <l>Of the crowned Magi; and the king whose eyes</l>
            <l>Saw the pierced Hands and Rood of elder rise</l>
            <l>In Druid vapour and make the torches dim;</l>
            <l>Till vain frenzy awoke and he died; and him</l>
            <l>Who met Fand walking among flaming dew</l>
            <l>By a grey shore where the wind never blew,</l>
            <l>And lost the world and Emer for a kiss;</l>
            <l>And him who drove the gods out of their liss,</l>
            <l>And till a hundred moms had flowered red</l>
            <l>Feasted, and wept the barrows of his dead;</l>
            <l>And the proud dreaming king who flung the crown</l>
            <l>And sorrow away, and calling bard and clown</l>
            <l>Dwelt among wine-stained wanderers in deep woods:</l>
            <l>And him who sold tillage, and house, and goods,</l>
            <l>And sought through lands and islands numberless</l>
            <l>years,</l>
            <l>Until he found, with laughter and with tears,</l>
            <l>A woman of so shining loveliness</l>
            <l>That men threshed corn at midnight by a tress,</l>
            <l>A little stolen tress. I, too, await</l>
            <l>The hour of thy great wind of love and hate.</l>
            <l>When shall the stars be blown about the sky,</l>
            <l>Like the sparks blown out of a smithy, and die?</l>
            <l>Surely thine hour has come, thy great wind blows,</l>
            <l>Far-off, most secret, and inviolate Rose?</l>
            <l>MAID QUIET</l>
            <l>WHERE has Maid Quiet gone to,</l>
            <l>Nodding her russet hood?</l>
            <l>The winds that awakened the stars</l>
            <l>Are blowing through my blood.</l>
            <l>O how could I be so calm</l>
            <l>When she rose up to depart?</l>
            <l>Now words that called up the lightning</l>
            <l>Are hurtling through my heart.</l>
            <l>THE TRAVAIL OF PASSION</l>
            <l>WHEN the flaming lute-thronged angelic door is wide;</l>
            <l>When an immortal passion breathes in mortal clay;</l>
            <l>Our hearts endure the scourge, the plaited thorns, the</l>
            <l>way</l>
            <l>Crowded with bitter faces, the wounds in palm and</l>
            <l>side,</l>
            <l>The vinegar-heavy sponge, the flowers by Kedron</l>
            <l>stream;</l>
            <l>We will bend down and loosen our hair over you,</l>
            <l>That it may drop faint perfume, and be heavy with</l>
            <l>dew,</l>
            <l>Lilies of death-pale hope, roses of passionate dream.</l>
            <l>THE LOVER PLEADS WITH HIS FRIEND FOR</l>
            <l>OLD FRIENDS</l>
            <l>THOUGH you are in your shining days,</l>
            <l>Voices among the crowd</l>
            <l>And new friends busy with your praise,</l>
            <l>Be not unkind or proud,</l>
            <l>But think about old friends the most:</l>
            <l>Time's bitter flood will rise,</l>
            <l>Your beauty perish and be lost</l>
            <l>For all eyes but these eyes.</l>
            <l>THE LOVER SPEAKS TO THE HEARERS OF HIS</l>
            <l>SONGS IN COMING DAYS</l>
            <l>O WOMEN, kneeling by your altar-rails long hence,</l>
            <l>When songs I wove for my beloved hide the prayer,</l>
            <l>And smoke from this dead heart drifts through the</l>
            <l>violet air</l>
            <l>And covers away the smoke of myrrh and frankincense;</l>
            <l>Bend down and pray for all that sin I wove in song,</l>
            <l>Till the Attorney for Lost Souls cry her sweet cry,</l>
            <l>And .call to my beloved and me: "No longer fly</l>
            <l>Amid the hovering, piteouS, penitential throng.'</l>
            <l>THE POET PLEADS WITH THE ELEMENTAL POWERS</l>
            <l>THE Powers whose name and shape no living creature</l>
            <l>knows</l>
            <l>Have pulled the Immortal Rose;</l>
            <l>And though the Seven Lights bowed in their dance and</l>
            <l>wept,</l>
            <l>The Polar Dragon slept,</l>
            <l>His heavy rings uncoiled from glimmering deep to deep:</l>
            <l>When will he wake from sleep?</l>
            <l>Great Powers of falling wave and wind and windy fire,</l>
            <l>With your harmonious choir</l>
            <l>Encircle her I love and sing her into peace,</l>
            <l>That my old care may cease;</l>
            <l>Unfold your flaming wings and cover out of sight</l>
            <l>The nets of day and night.</l>
            <l>Dim powers of drowsy thought, let her no longer be</l>
            <l>Like the pale cup of the sea,</l>
            <l>When winds have gathered and sun and moon burned</l>
            <l>dim</l>
            <l>Above its cloudy rim;</l>
            <l>But let a gentle silence wrought with music flow</l>
            <l>Whither her footsteps go.</l>
            <l>HE WISHES HIS BELOVED WERE DEAD</l>
            <l>WERE you but lying cold and dead,</l>
            <l>And lights were paling out of the West,</l>
            <l>You would come hither, and bend your head,</l>
            <l>And I would lay my head on your breast;</l>
            <l>And you would murmur tender words,</l>
            <l>Forgiving me, because you were dead:</l>
            <l>Nor would you rise and hasten away,</l>
            <l>Though you have the will of the wild birds,</l>
            <l>But know your hair was bound and wound</l>
            <l>About the stars and moon and sun:</l>
            <l>O would, beloved, that you lay</l>
            <l>Under the dock-leaves in the ground,</l>
            <l>While lights were paling one by one.</l>
            <l>HE WISHES FOR THE CLOTHS OF HEAVEN</l>
            <l>HAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,</l>
            <l>Enwrought with golden and silver light,</l>
            <l>The blue and the dim and the dark cloths</l>
            <l>Of night and light and the half-light,</l>
            <l>I would spread the cloths under your feet:</l>
            <l>But I, being poor, have only my dreams;</l>
            <l>I have spread my dreams under your feet;</l>
            <l>Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</l>
            <l>HE THINKS OF HIS PAST GREATNESS WHEN A</l>
            <l>PART OF THE CONSTELLATIONS OF HEAVEN</l>
            <l>I HAVE drunk ale from the Country of the Young</l>
            <l>And weep because I know all things now:</l>
            <l>I have been a hazel-tree, and they hung</l>
            <l>The Pilot Star and the Crooked Plough</l>
            <l>Among my leaves in times out of mind:</l>
            <l>I became a rush that horses tread:</l>
            <l>I became a man, a hater of the wind,</l>
            <l>Knowing one, out of all things, alone, that his head</l>
            <l>May not lie on the breast nor his lips on thc hair</l>
            <l>Of the woman that he loves, until he dies.</l>
            <l>O beast of the wilderness, bird of the air,</l>
            <l>Must I endure your amorous cries?</l>
            <l>THE FIDDLER OF DOONEY</l>
            <l>WHEN I play on my fiddle in Dooney.</l>
            <l>Folk dance like a wave of the sea;</l>
            <l>My cousin is priest in Kilvarnet,</l>
            <l>My brother in Mocharabuiee.</l>
            <l>I passed my brother and cousin:</l>
            <l>They read in their books of prayer;</l>
            <l>I read in my book of songs</l>
            <l>I bought at the Sligo fair.</l>
            <l>When we come at the end of time</l>
            <l>To Peter sitting in state,</l>
            <l>He will smile on the three old spirits,</l>
            <l>But call me first through the gate;</l>
            <l>For the good are always the merry,</l>
            <l>Save by an evil chance,</l>
            <l>And the merry love the fiddle,</l>
            <l>And the merry love to dance:</l>
            <l>And when the folk there spy me,</l>
            <l>They will all come up to me,</l>
            <l>With "Here is the fiddler of Dooney!'</l>
            <l>And dance like a wave of the sea.</l>

                  <l>I HAVE heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods</l>
                  <l>Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees</l>
                  <l>Hum in the lime-tree flowers; and put away</l>
                  <l>The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness</l>
                  <l>That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile</l>
                  <l>Tara uprooted, and new commonness</l>
                  <l>Upon the throne and crying about the streets</l>
                  <l>And hanging its paper flowers from post to post,</l>
                  <l>Because it is alone of all things happy.</l>
                  <l>I am contented, for I know that Quiet</l>
                  <l>Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart</l>
                  <l>Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer,</l>

               <l>I HAVE heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods</l>
               <l>Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees</l>
               <l>Hum in the lime-tree flowers; and put away</l>
               <l>The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness</l>
               <l>That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile</l>
               <l>Tara uprooted, and new commonness</l>
               <l>Upon the throne and crying about the streets</l>
               <l>And hanging its paper flowers from post to post,</l>
               <l>Because it is alone of all things happy.</l>
               <l>I am contented, for I know that Quiet</l>
               <l>Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart</l>
               <l>Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer,</l>
               <l>Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs</l>
               <l>A cloudy quiver over Pairc-na-lee.</l>
               <l>THE ARROW</l>
               <l>I THOUGHT of your beauty, and this arrow,</l>
               <l>Made out of a wild thought, is in my marrow.</l>
               <l>There's no man may look upon her, no man,</l>
               <l>As when newly grown to be a woman,</l>
               <l>Tall and noble but with face and bosom</l>
               <l>Delicate in colour as apple blossom.</l>
               <l>This beauty's kinder, yet for a reason</l>
               <l>I could weep that the old is out of season.</l>
               <l>THE FOLLY OF BEING COMFORTED</l>
               <l>ONE that is ever kind said yesterday:</l>
               <l>"Your well-beloved's hair has threads of grey,</l>
               <l>And little shadows come about her eyes;</l>
               <l>Time can but make it easier to be wise</l>
               <l>Though now it seems impossible, and so</l>
               <l>All that you need is patience.'</l>
               <l>Heart cries, "No,</l>
               <l>I have not a crumb of comfort, not a grain.</l>
               <l>Time can but make her beauty over again:</l>
               <l>Because of that great nobleness of hers</l>
               <l>The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs,</l>
               <l>Burns but more clearly. O she had not these ways</l>
               <l>When all the wild Summer was in her gaze.'</l>
               <l>0 heart! O heart! if she'd but turn her head,</l>
               <l>You'd know the folly of being comforted.</l>
               <l>OLD MEMORY</l>
               <l>O THOUGHT, fly to her when the end of day</l>
               <l>Awakens an old memory, and say,</l>
               <l>"Your strength, that is so lofty and fierce and kind,</l>
               <l>It might call up a new age, calling to mind</l>
               <l>The queens that were imagined long ago,</l>
               <l>Is but half yours: he kneaded in the dough</l>
               <l>Through the long years of youth, and who would have</l>
               <l>thought</l>
               <l>It all, and more than it all, would come to naught,</l>
               <l>And that dear words meant nothing?' But enough,</l>
               <l>For when we have blamed the wind we can blame love;</l>
               <l>Or, if there needs be more, be nothing said</l>
               <l>That would be harsh for children that have strayed.</l>
               <l>NEVER GIVE ALL THE HEART</l>
               <l>NEVER give all the heart, for love</l>
               <l>Will hardly seem worth thinking of</l>
               <l>To passionate women if it seem</l>
               <l>Certain, and they never dream</l>
               <l>That it fades out from kiss to kiss;</l>
               <l>For everything that's lovely is</l>
               <l>But a brief, dreamy. kind delight.</l>
               <l>O never give the heart outright,</l>
               <l>For they, for all smooth lips can say,</l>
               <l>Have given their hearts up to the play.</l>
               <l>And who could play it well enough</l>
               <l>If deaf and dumb and blind with love?</l>
               <l>He that made this knows all the cost,</l>
               <l>For he gave all his heart and lost.</l>
               <l>THE WITHERING OF THE BOUGHS</l>
               <l>I CRIED when the moon was mutmuring to the birds:</l>
               <l>"Let peewit call and curlew cry where they will,</l>
               <l>I long for your merry and tender and pitiful words,</l>
               <l>For the roads are unending, and there is no place to my</l>
               <l>mind.'</l>
               <l>The honey-pale moon lay low on the sleepy hill,</l>
               <l>And I fell asleep upon lonely Echtge of streams.</l>
               <l>No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind;</l>
               <l>The boughs have withered because I have told them my, dreams.</l>
               <l>I know of the leafy paths that the witches take</l>
               <l>Who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles</l>
               <l>of wool,</l>
               <l>And their secret smile, out of the depths of the lake;</l>
               <l>I know where a dim moon drifts, where the Danaan</l>
               <l>kind</l>
               <l>Wind and unwind their dances when the light grows</l>
               <l>cool</l>
               <l>On the island lawns, their feet where the pale foam</l>
               <l>gleams.</l>
               <l>No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind;</l>
               <l>The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</l>
               <l>I know of the sleepy country, where swans fly round</l>
               <l>Coupled with golden chains, and sing as they fly.</l>
               <l>A king and a queen are wandering there, and the sound</l>
               <l>Has made them so happy and hopeless, so deaf and so</l>
               <l>blind</l>
               <l>With wisdom, they wander till all the years have gone</l>
               <l>by;</l>
               <l>I know, and the curlew and peewit on Echtge of</l>
               <l>streams.</l>
               <l>No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind;</l>
               <l>The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</l>
               <l>ADAM'S CURSE</l>
               <l>WE sat together at one summer's end,</l>
               <l>That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,</l>
               <l>And you and I, and talked of poetry.</l>
               <l>I said, "A line will take us hours maybe;</l>
               <l>Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,</l>
               <l>Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.</l>
               <l>Better go down upon your marrow-bones</l>
               <l>And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones</l>
               <l>Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;</l>
               <l>For to articulate sweet sounds together</l>
               <l>Is to work harder than all these, and yet</l>
               <l>Be thought an idler by the noisy set</l>
               <l>Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen</l>
               <l>The martyrs call the world.'</l>
               <l>And thereupon</l>
               <l>That beautiful mild woman for whose sake</l>
               <l>There's many a one shall find out all heartache</l>
               <l>On finding that her voice is sweet and low</l>
               <l>Replied, "To be born woman is to know — </l>
               <l>Although they do not talk of it at school — </l>
               <l>That we must labour to be beautiful.'</l>
               <l>I said, "It's certain there is no fine thing</l>
               <l>Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.</l>
               <l>There have been lovers who thought love should be</l>
               <l>So much compounded of high courtesy</l>
               <l>That they would sigh and quote with learned looks</l>
               <l>precedents out of beautiful old books;</l>
               <l>Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'</l>
               <l>We sat grown quiet at the name of love;</l>
               <l>We saw the last embers of daylight die,</l>
               <l>And in the trembling blue-green of the sky</l>
               <l>A moon, worn as if it had been a shell</l>
               <l>Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell</l>
               <l>About the stars and broke in days and years.</l>
               <l>I had a thought for no one's but your ears:</l>
               <l>That you were beautiful, and that I strove</l>
               <l>To love you in the old high way of love;</l>
               <l>That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown</l>
               <l>As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.</l>

               <l>THE OLD MEN ADMIRING THEMSELVES IN THE</l>
               <l>WATER</l>

               <l>"Everything alters,</l>
               <l>And one by one we drop away.'</l>
               <l>They had hands like claws, and their knees</l>
               <l>Were twisted like the old thorn-trees</l>
               <l>By the waters.</l>
               <l>I heard the old, old men say,</l>
               <l>"All that's beautiful drifts away</l>
               <l>Like the waters.'</l>
               <l>UNDER THE MOON</l>
               <l>I HAVE no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde,</l>
               <l>Nor Avalon the grass-green hollow, nor Joyous Isle,</l>
               <l>Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid him for a</l>
               <l>while;</l>
               <l>Nor Uladh, when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the</l>
               <l>wind;</l>
               <l>Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the</l>
               <l>heart:</l>
               <l>Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon's light and</l>
               <l>the sun's</l>
               <l>Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long-lived ones,</l>
               <l>Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the</l>
               <l>gates apart,</l>
               <l>And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn,</l>
               <l>To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier.</l>
               <l>Therein are many queens like Branwen and Guinevere;</l>
               <l>And Niamh and Laban and Fand, who could change</l>
               <l>to an otter or fawn,</l>
               <l>And the wood-woman, whose lover was changed to a</l>
               <l>blue-eyed hawk;</l>
               <l>And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun,</l>
               <l>or shore,</l>
               <l>Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the</l>
               <l>oar,</l>
               <l>I hear the harp-string praise them, or hear their mourn-</l>
               <l>ful talk.</l>
               <l>Because of something told under the famished horn</l>
               <l>Of the hunter's moon, that hung between the night and</l>
               <l>the day,</l>
               <l>To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dis-</l>
               <l>may,</l>
               <l>Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.</l>
               <l>THE RAGGED WOOD</l>
               <l>O HURRY where by water among the trees</l>
               <l>The delicate-stepping stag and his lady sigh,</l>
               <l>When they have but looked upon their images — </l>
               <l>Would none had ever loved but you and I!</l>
               <l>Or have you heard that sliding silver-shoed</l>
               <l>Pale silver-proud queen-woman of the sky,</l>
               <l>When the sun looked out of his golden hood? — </l>
               <l>O that none ever loved but you and I!</l>
               <l>O hurty to the ragged wood, for there</l>
               <l>I will drive all those lovers out and cry — </l>
               <l>O my share of the world, O yellow hair!</l>
               <l>No one has ever loved but you and I.</l>
               <l>O DO NOT LOVE TOO LONG</l>
               <l>SWEETHEART, do not love too long:</l>
               <l>I loved long and long,</l>
               <l>And grew to be out of fashion</l>
               <l>Like an old song.</l>
               <l>All through the years of our youth</l>
               <l>Neither could have known</l>
               <l>Their own thought from the other's,</l>
               <l>We were so much at one.</l>
               <l>But O, in a minute she changed — </l>
               <l>O do not love too long,</l>
               <l>Or you will grow out of fashion</l>
               <l>Like an old song.</l>
               <l>THE PLAYERS ASK FOR A BLESSING ON THE</l>
               <l>PSALTERIES AND ON THEMSELVES</l>
               <l>Three Voices [together]. Hurry to bless the hands that play,</l>
               <l>The mouths that speak, the notes and strings,</l>
               <l>O masters of the glittering town!</l>
               <l>O! lay the shrilly trumpet down,</l>
               <l>Though drunken with the flags that sway</l>
               <l>Over the ramparts and the towers,</l>
               <l>And with the waving of your wings.</l>
               <l>First Voice. Maybe they linger by the way.</l>
               <l>One gathers up his purple gown;</l>
               <l>One leans and mutters by the wall — </l>
               <l>He dreads the weight of mortal hours.</l>
               <l>Second Voice. O no, O no! they hurry down</l>
               <l>Like plovers that have heard the call.</l>
               <l>Third Voice. O kinsmen of the Three in One,</l>
               <l>O kinsmen, bless the hands that play.</l>
               <l>The notes they waken shall live on</l>
               <l>When all this heavy history's done;</l>
               <l>Our hands, our hands must ebb away.</l>
               <l>Three Voices [together]. The proud and careless notes live</l>
               <l>on,</l>
               <l>But bless our hands that ebb away.</l>
               <l>THE HAPPY TOWNLAND</l>

               <l>For O, the strong farmers</l>
               <l>That would let the spade lie,</l>
               <l>Their hearts would be like a cup</l>
               <l>That somebody had drunk dry.</l>
               <l>The little fox he murmured,</l>

               <l>Michael will unhook his trumpet</l>
               <l>From a bough overhead,</l>
               <l>And blow a little noise</l>
               <l>When the supper has been spread.</l>
               <l>Gabriel will come from the water</l>
               <l>With a fish-tail, and talk</l>
               <l>Of wonders that have happened</l>

            <l>Pardon, old fathers, if you still remain</l>
            <l>Somewhere in ear-shot for the story's end,</l>
            <l>Old Dublin merchant "free of the ten and four'</l>
            <l>Or trading out of Galway into Spain;</l>
            <l>Old country scholar, Robert Emmet's friend,</l>
            <l>A hundred-year-old memory to the poor;</l>
            <l>Merchant and scholar who have left me blood</l>
            <l>That has not passed through any huckster's loin,</l>
            <l>Soldiers that gave, whatever die was cast:</l>
            <l>A Butler or an Armstrong that withstood</l>
            <l>Beside the brackish waters of the Boyne</l>
            <l>James and his Irish when the Dutchman crossed;</l>
            <l>Old merchant skipper that leaped overboard</l>
            <l>After a ragged hat in Biscay Bay;</l>
            <l>You most of all, silent and fierce old man,</l>
            <l>Because the daily spectacle that stirred</l>
            <l>My fancy, and set my boyish lips to say,</l>
            <l>"Only the wasteful virtues earn the sun';</l>
            <l>Pardon that for a barren passion's sake,</l>
            <l>Although I have come close on forty-nine,</l>
            <l>I have no child, I have nothing but a book,</l>
            <l>Nothing but that to prove your blood and mine.</l>
            <l>RESPONSIBILITIES</l>
            <l>THE GREY ROCK</l>
            <l>Poets with whom I learned my trade.</l>
            <l>Companions of the Cheshire Cheese,</l>
            <l>Here's an old story I've remade,</l>
            <l>Imagining 'twould better please</l>
            <l>Your cars than stories now in fashion,</l>
            <l>Though you may think I waste my breath</l>
            <l>Pretending that there can be passion</l>
            <l>That has more life in it than death,</l>
            <l>And though at bottling of your wine</l>
            <l>Old wholesome Goban had no say;</l>
            <l>The moral's yours because it's mine.</l>
            <l>When cups went round at close of day — </l>
            <l>Is not that how good stories run? — </l>
            <l>The gods were sitting at the board</l>
            <l>In their great house at Slievenamon.</l>
            <l>They sang a drowsy song, Or snored,</l>
            <l>For all were full of wine and meat.</l>
            <l>The smoky torches made a glare</l>
            <l>On metal Goban 'd hammered at,</l>
            <l>On old deep silver rolling there</l>
            <l>Or on somc still unemptied cup</l>
            <l>That he, when frenzy stirred his thews,</l>
            <l>Had hammered out on mountain top</l>
            <l>To hold the sacred stuff he brews</l>
            <l>That only gods may buy of him.</l>
            <l>Now from that juice that made them wise</l>
            <l>All those had lifted up the dim</l>
            <l>Imaginations of their eyes,</l>
            <l>For one that was like woman made</l>
            <l>Before their sleepy eyelids ran</l>
            <l>And rrembling with her passion said,</l>
            <l>"Come out and dig for a dead man,</l>
            <l>Who's burrowing Somewhere in the ground</l>
            <l>And mock him to his face and then</l>
            <l>Hollo him on with horse and hound,</l>
            <l>For he is the worst of all dead men.'</l>
            <l>We should be dazed and terror-struck,</l>
            <l>If we but saw in dreams that room,</l>
            <l>Those wine-drenched eyes, and curse our luck</l>
            <l>That empticd all our days to come.</l>
            <l>I knew a woman none could please,</l>
            <l>Because she dreamed when but a child</l>
            <l>Of men and women made like these;</l>
            <l>And after, when her blood ran wild,</l>
            <l>Had ravelled her own story out,</l>
            <l>And said, "In two or in three years</l>
            <l>I needs must marry some poor lout,'</l>
            <l>And having said it, burst in tears.</l>
            <l>Since, tavern comrades, you have died,</l>
            <l>Maybe your images have stood,</l>
            <l>Mere bone and muscle thrown aside,</l>
            <l>Before that roomful or as good.</l>
            <l>You had to face your ends when young — </l>
            <l>'Twas wine or women, or some curse — </l>
            <l>But never made a poorer song</l>
            <l>That you might have a heavier purse,</l>
            <l>Nor gave loud service to a cause</l>
            <l>That you might have a troop of friends,</l>
            <l>You kept the Muses' sterner laws,</l>
            <l>And unrepenting faced your ends,</l>
            <l>And therefore earned the right — and yet</l>
            <l>Dowson and Johnson most I praise — </l>
            <l>To troop with those the world's forgot,</l>
            <l>And copy their proud steady gaze.</l>
            <l>"The Danish troop was driven out</l>
            <l>Between the dawn and dusk,' she said;</l>
            <l>"Although the event was long in doubt.</l>
            <l>Although the King of Ireland's dead</l>
            <l>And half the kings, before sundown</l>
            <l>All was accomplished.</l>
            <l>"When this day</l>
            <l>Murrough, the King of Ireland's son,</l>
            <l>Foot after foot was giving way,</l>
            <l>He and his best troops back to back</l>
            <l>Had perished there, but the Danes ran,</l>
            <l>Stricken with panic from the attack,</l>
            <l>The shouting of an unseen man;</l>
            <l>And being thankful Murrough found,</l>
            <l>Led by a footsole dipped in blood</l>
            <l>That had made prints upon the ground,</l>
            <l>Where by old thorn-trees that man stood;</l>
            <l>And though when he gazed here and there,</l>
            <l>He had but gazed on thorn-trees, spoke,</l>
            <l>""Who is the friend that seems but air</l>
            <l>And yet could give so fine a stroke?''</l>
            <l>Thereon a young man met his eye,</l>
            <l>Who said, ""Because she held me in</l>
            <l>Her love, and would not have me die,</l>
            <l>Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin,</l>
            <l>And pushing it into my shirt,</l>
            <l>Promised that for a pin's sake</l>
            <l>No man should see to do me hurt;</l>
            <l>But there it's gone; I will not take</l>
            <l>The fortune that had been my shame</l>
            <l>Seeing, King's son, what wounds you have. — </l>
            <l>'Twas roundly spoke, but when night came</l>
            <l>He had betrayed me to his grave,</l>
            <l>For he and the King's son were dead.</l>
            <l>I'd promised him two hundred years,</l>
            <l>And when for all I'd done or said — </l>
            <l>And these immortal eyes shed tears — </l>
            <l>He claimed his country's need was most,</l>
            <l>I'd saved his life, yet for the sake</l>
            <l>Of a new friend he has turned a ghost.</l>
            <l>What does he cate if my heart break?</l>
            <l>I call for spade and horse and hound</l>
            <l>That we may harry him.' Thereon</l>
            <l>She cast herself upon the ground</l>
            <l>And rent her clothes and made her moan:</l>
            <l>"Why are they faithless when their might</l>
            <l>Is from the holy shades that rove</l>
            <l>The grey rock and the windy light?</l>
            <l>Why should the faithfullest heart most love</l>
            <l>The bitter sweetness of false faces?</l>
            <l>Why must the lasting love what passes,</l>
            <l>Why are the gods by men betrayed?'</l>
            <l>But thereon every god stood up</l>
            <l>With a slow smile and without sound,</l>
            <l>And Stretching forth his arm and cup</l>
            <l>To where she moaned upon the ground,</l>
            <l>Suddenly drenched her to the skin;</l>
            <l>And she with Goban's wine adrip,</l>
            <l>No more remembering what had been.</l>
            <l>Stared at the gods with laughing lip.</l>
            <l>I have kept my faith, though faith was tried,</l>
            <l>To that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,</l>
            <l>And thc world's altered since you died,</l>
            <l>And I am in no good repute</l>
            <l>With the loud host before the sea,</l>
            <l>That think sword-strokes were better meant</l>
            <l>Than lover's music — let that be,</l>
            <l>So that the wandering foot's content.</l>
            <l>TO A WEALTHY MAN WHO PROMISED A SECOND</l>
            <l>SUBSCRIPTION TO THE DUBLIN MUNICIPAL</l>
            <l>GALLERY IF IT WERE PROVED THE PEOPLE</l>
            <l>WANTED PICTURES</l>
            <l>YOU gave, but will not give again</l>
            <l>Until enough of paudeen's pence</l>
            <l>By Biddy's halfpennies have lain</l>
            <l>To be "some sort of evidence',</l>
            <l>Before you'll put your guineas down,</l>
            <l>That things it were a pride to give</l>
            <l>Are what the blind and ignorant town</l>
            <l>Imagines best to make it thrive.</l>
            <l>What cared Duke Ercole, that bid</l>
            <l>His mummers to the market-place,</l>
            <l>What th' onion-sellers thought or did</l>
            <l>So that his plautus set the pace</l>
            <l>For the Italian comedies?</l>
            <l>And Guidobaldo, when he made</l>
            <l>That grammar school of courtesies</l>
            <l>Where wit and beauty learned their trade</l>
            <l>Upon Urbino's windy hill,</l>
            <l>Had sent no runners to and fro</l>
            <l>That he might learn the shepherds' will</l>
            <l>And when they drove out Cosimo,</l>
            <l>Indifferent how the rancour ran,</l>
            <l>He gave the hours they had set free</l>
            <l>To Michelozzo's latest plan</l>
            <l>For the San Marco Library,</l>
            <l>Whence turbulent Italy should draw</l>
            <l>Delight in Art whoSe end is peace,</l>
            <l>In logic and in natural law</l>
            <l>By sucking at the dugs of Greece.</l>
            <l>Your open hand but shows our loss,</l>

            <l>What the exultant heart calls good</l>
            <l>That some new day may breed the best</l>
            <l>Because you gave, not what they would,</l>
            <l>But the right twigs for an eagle's nest!</l>

            <l>SEPTEMBER 1913</l>
            <l>WHAT need you, being come to sense,</l>
            <l>But fumble in a greasy till</l>
            <l>And add the halfpence to the pence</l>
            <l>And prayer to shivering prayer, until</l>
            <l>You have dried the marrow from the bone?</l>
            <l>For men were born to pray and save:</l>
            <l>Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,</l>
            <l>It's with O'Leary in the grave.</l>
            <l>Yet they were of a different kind,</l>
            <l>The names that stilled your childish play,</l>
            <l>They have gone about the world like wind,</l>
            <l>But little time had they to pray</l>
            <l>For whom the hangman's rope was spun,</l>
            <l>And what, God help us, could they save?</l>
            <l>Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,</l>
            <l>It's with O'Leary in the grave.</l>
            <l>Was it for this the wild geese spread</l>
            <l>The grey wing upon every tide;</l>
            <l>For this that all that blood was shed,</l>
            <l>For this Edward Fitzgerald died,</l>
            <l>And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,</l>
            <l>All that delirium of the brave?</l>
            <l>Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,</l>
            <l>It's with O'Leary in the grave.</l>
            <l>Yet could we turn the years again,</l>
            <l>And call those exiles as they were</l>
            <l>In all their loneliness and pain,</l>
            <l>You'd cry, "Some woman's yellow hair</l>
            <l>Has maddened every mother's son':</l>
            <l>They weighed so lightly what they gave.</l>
            <l>But let them be, they're dead and gone,</l>
            <l>They're with O'Leary in the grave.</l>
            <l>TO A FRIEND WHOSE WORK HAS COME TO NOTHING</l>
            <l>NOW all the truth is out,</l>
            <l>Be secret and take defeat</l>
            <l>From any brazen throat,</l>
            <l>For how can you compete,</l>
            <l>Being honour bred, with one</l>
            <l>Who, were it proved he lies,</l>
            <l>Were neither shamed in his own</l>
            <l>Nor in his neighbours' eyes?</l>
            <l>Bred to a harder thing</l>
            <l>Than Triumph, turn away</l>
            <l>And like a laughing string</l>
            <l>Whereon mad fingers play</l>
            <l>Amid a place of stone,</l>
            <l>Be secret and exult,</l>
            <l>Because of all things known</l>
            <l>That is most difficult.</l>
            <l>PAUDEEN</l>
            <l>INDIGNANT at the fumbling wits, the obscure spite</l>
            <l>Of our old paudeen in his shop, I stumbled blind</l>
            <l>Among the stones and thorn-trees, under morning light;</l>
            <l>Until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind</l>
            <l>A curlew answered; and suddenly thereupon I thought</l>
            <l>That on the lonely height where all are in God's eye,</l>
            <l>There cannot be, confusion of our sound forgot,</l>
            <l>A single soul that lacks a sweet crystalline cry.</l>
            <l>TO A SHADE</l>
            <l>IF you have revisited the town, thin Shade,</l>
            <l>Whether to look upon your monument</l>
            <l>(I wonder if the builder has been paid)</l>
            <l>Or happier-thoughted when the day is spent</l>
            <l>To drink of that salt breath out of the sea</l>
            <l>When grey gulls flit about instead of men,</l>
            <l>And the gaunt houses put on majesty:</l>
            <l>Let these content you and be gone again;</l>
            <l>For they are at their old tricks yet.</l>
            <l>A man</l>
            <l>Of your own passionate serving kind who had brought</l>
            <l>In his full hands what, had they only known,</l>
            <l>Had given their children's children loftier thought,</l>
            <l>Sweeter emotion, working in their veins</l>
            <l>Like gentle blood, has been driven from the place,</l>
            <l>And instilt heaped upon him for his pains,</l>
            <l>And for his open-handedness, disgrace;</l>
            <l>Your enemy, an old fotil mouth, had set</l>
            <l>The pack upon him.</l>
            <l>Go, unquiet wanderer,</l>
            <l>And gather the Glasnevin coverlet</l>
            <l>About your head till the dust stops your ear,</l>
            <l>The time for you to taste of that Salt breath</l>
            <l>And listen at the corners has not come;</l>
            <l>You had enough of sorrow before death — </l>
            <l>Away, away! You are safer in the tomb.</l>
            <l>WHEN HELEN LIVED</l>
            <l>WE have cried in our despair</l>
            <l>That men desert,</l>
            <l>For some trivial affair</l>
            <l>Or noisy, insolent sport,</l>
            <l>Beauty that we have won</l>
            <l>From bitterest hours;</l>
            <l>Yet we, had we walked within</l>
            <l>Those topless towers</l>
            <l>Where Helen waked with her boy,</l>
            <l>Had given but as the rest</l>
            <l>Of the men and women of Troy,</l>
            <l>A word and a jest.</l>
            <l>ON THOSE THAT HATED "THE PLAYBOY OF THE</l>
            <l>WESTERN WORLD', 1907</l>
            <l>ONCE, when midnight smote the air,</l>
            <l>Eunuchs ran through Hell and met</l>
            <l>On every crowded street to stare</l>
            <l>Upon great Juan riding by:</l>
            <l>Even like these to rail and sweat</l>
            <l>Staring upon his sinewy thigh.</l>
            <l>THE THREE BEGGARS</l>
            <l>"Though to my feathers in the wet,</l>
            <l>I have stood here from break of day.</l>
            <l>I have not found a thing to eat,</l>
            <l>For only rubbish comes my way.</l>
            <l>Am I to live on lebeen-lone?'</l>
            <l>Muttered the old crane of Gort.</l>
            <l>"For all my pains on lebeen-lone?'</l>
            <l>King Guaire walked amid his court</l>
            <l>The palace-yard and river-side</l>
            <l>And there to three old beggars said,</l>
            <l>"You that have wandered far and wide</l>
            <l>Can ravel out what's in my head.</l>
            <l>Do men who least desire get most,</l>
            <l>Or get the most who most desire?'</l>
            <l>A beggar said, "They get the most</l>
            <l>Whom man or devil cannot tire,</l>
            <l>And what could make their muscles taut</l>
            <l>Unless desire had made them so?'</l>
            <l>But Guaire laughed with secret thought,</l>
            <l>"If that be true as it seems true,</l>
            <l>One of you three is a rich man,</l>
            <l>For he shall have a thousand pounds</l>
            <l>Who is first asleep, if but he can</l>
            <l>Sleep before the third noon sounds."</l>
            <l>And thereon, merry as a bird</l>
            <l>With his old thoughts, King Guaire went</l>
            <l>From river-side and palace-yard</l>
            <l>And left them to their argument.</l>
            <l>"And if I win,' one beggar said,</l>
            <l>'Though I am old I shall persuade</l>
            <l>A pretty girl to share my bed';</l>
            <l>The second: "I shall learn a trade';</l>
            <l>The third: "I'll hurry' to the course</l>
            <l>Among the other gentlemen,</l>
            <l>And lay it all upon a horse';</l>
            <l>The second: "I have thought again:</l>
            <l>A farmer has more dignity.'</l>
            <l>One to another sighed and cried:</l>
            <l>The exorbitant dreams of beggary.</l>
            <l>That idleness had borne to pride,</l>
            <l>Sang through their teeth from noon to noon;</l>
            <l>And when the sccond twilight brought</l>
            <l>The frenzy of the beggars' moon</l>
            <l>None closed his blood-shot eyes but sought</l>
            <l>To keep his fellows from their sleep;</l>
            <l>All shouted till their anger grew</l>
            <l>And they were whirling in a heap.</l>
            <l>They mauled and bit the whole night through;</l>
            <l>They mauled and bit till the day shone;</l>
            <l>They mauled and bit through all that day</l>
            <l>And till another night had gone,</l>
            <l>Or if they made a moment's stay</l>
            <l>They sat upon their heels to rail, ,</l>
            <l>And when old Guaire came and stood</l>
            <l>Before the three to end this tale,</l>
            <l>They were commingling lice and blood</l>
            <l>"Time's up,' he cried, and all the three</l>
            <l>With blood-shot eyes upon him stared.</l>
            <l>"Time's up,' he eried, and all the three</l>
            <l>Fell down upon the dust and snored.</l>
            <l>"Maybe I shall be lucky yet,</l>
            <l>Now they are silent,' said the crane.</l>
            <l>"Though to my feathers in the wet</l>
            <l>I've stood as I were made of stone</l>
            <l>And seen the rubbish run about,</l>
            <l>It's certain there are trout somewhere</l>
            <l>And maybe I shall take a trout</l>
            <l>but I do not seem to care.'</l>
            <l>THE THREE HERMITS</l>
            <l>THREE old hermits took the air</l>
            <l>By a cold and desolate sea,</l>
            <l>First was muttering a prayer,</l>
            <l>Second rummaged for a flea;</l>
            <l>On a windy stone, the third,</l>
            <l>Giddy with his hundredth year,</l>
            <l>Sang unnoticed like a bird:</l>
            <l>"Though the Door of Death is near</l>
            <l>And what waits behind the door,</l>
            <l>Three times in a single day</l>
            <l>I, though upright on the shore,</l>
            <l>Fall asleep when I should pray.'</l>
            <l>So the first, but now the second:</l>
            <l>"We're but given what we have eamed</l>
            <l>When all thoughts and deeds are reckoned,</l>
            <l>So it's plain to be discerned</l>
            <l>That the shades of holy men</l>
            <l>Who have failed, being weak of will,</l>
            <l>Pass the Door of Birth again,</l>
            <l>And are plagued by crowds, until</l>
            <l>They've the passion to escape."</l>
            <l>Moaned the other, "They are thrown</l>
            <l>Into some most fearful shape.'</l>
            <l>But the second mocked his moan:</l>
            <l>"They are not changed to anything,</l>
            <l>Having loved God once, but maybe</l>
            <l>To a poet or a king</l>
            <l>Or a witty lovely lady."</l>
            <l>While he'd rummaged rags and hair,</l>
            <l>Caught and cracked his flea, the third,</l>
            <l>Giddy with his hundredth year,</l>
            <l>Sang unnoticed like a bird.</l>
            <l>BEGGAR TO BEGGAR CRIED</l>
            <l>"TIME to put off the world and go somewhere</l>
            <l>And find my health again in the sea air,'</l>
            <l>Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,</l>
            <l>"And make my soul before my pate is bare.-</l>
            <l>"And get a comfortable wife and house</l>
            <l>To rid me of the devil in my shoes,'</l>
            <l>Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,</l>
            <l>"And the worse devil that is between my thighs.'</l>
            <l>And though I'd marry with a comely lass,</l>
            <l>She need not be too comely — let it pass,'</l>
            <l>Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,</l>
            <l>"But there's a devil in a looking-glass.'</l>
            <l>"Nor should she be too rich, because the rich</l>
            <l>Are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch,'</l>
            <l>Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,</l>
            <l>"And cannot have a humorous happy speech.'</l>
            <l>"And there I'll grow respected at my ease,</l>
            <l>And hear amid the garden's nightly peace.'</l>
            <l>Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,</l>
            <l>"The wind-blown clamour of the barnacle-geese.'</l>
            <l>RUNNING TO PARADISE</l>
            <l>As I came over Windy Gap</l>
            <l>They threw a halfpenny into my cap.</l>
            <l>For I am running to paradise;</l>
            <l>And all that I need do is to wish</l>
            <l>And somebody puts his hand in the dish</l>
            <l>To throw me a bit of salted fish:</l>
            <l>And there the king is but as the beggar.</l>
            <l>My brother Mourteen is worn out</l>
            <l>With skelping his big brawling lout,</l>
            <l>And I am running to paradise;</l>
            <l>A poor life, do what he can,</l>
            <l>And though he keep a dog and a gun,</l>
            <l>A serving-maid and a serving-man:</l>
            <l>And there the king is but as the beggar.</l>
            <l>Poor men have grown to be rich men,</l>
            <l>And rich men grown to be poor again,</l>
            <l>And I am running to paradise;</l>
            <l>And many a darling wit's grown dull</l>
            <l>That tossed a bare heel when at school,</l>
            <l>Now it has filled a old sock full:</l>
            <l>And there the king is but as the beggar.</l>
            <l>The wind is old and still at play</l>
            <l>While I must hurty upon my way.</l>
            <l>For I am running to paradise;</l>
            <l>Yet never have I lit on a friend</l>
            <l>To take my fancy like the wind</l>
            <l>That nobody can buy or bind:</l>
            <l>And there the king is but as the beggar.</l>
            <l>THE HOUR BEFORE DAWN</l>
            <l>A CURSING rogue with a merry face,</l>
            <l>A bundle of rags upon a crutch,</l>
            <l>Stumbled upon that windy place</l>
            <l>Called Cruachan, and it was as much</l>
            <l>As the one sturdy leg could do</l>
            <l>To keep him upright while he cursed.</l>
            <l>He had counted, where long years ago</l>
            <l>Queen Maeve's nine Maines had been nursed,</l>
            <l>A pair of lapwings, one old sheep,</l>
            <l>And not a house to the plain's edge,</l>
            <l>When close to his right hand a heap</l>
            <l>Of grey stones and a rocky ledge</l>
            <l>Reminded him that he could make.</l>
            <l>If he but shifted a few stones,</l>
            <l>A shelter till the daylight broke.</l>
            <l>But while he fumbled with the stones</l>
            <l>They toppled over; "Were it not</l>
            <l>I have a lucky wooden shin</l>
            <l>I had been hurt'; and toppling brought</l>
            <l>Before his eyes, where stones had been,</l>
            <l>A dark deep hollow in the rock.</l>
            <l>He gave a gasp and thought to have fled,</l>
            <l>Being certain it was no right rock</l>
            <l>Because an ancient history said</l>
            <l>Hell Mouth lay open near that place,</l>
            <l>And yet stood still, because inside</l>
            <l>A great lad with a beery face</l>
            <l>Had tucked himself away beside</l>
            <l>A ladle and a tub of beer,</l>
            <l>And snored, no phantom by his look.</l>
            <l>So with a laugh at his own fear</l>
            <l>He crawled into that pleasant nook.</l>
            <l>"Night grows uneasy near the dawn</l>
            <l>Till even I sleep light; but who</l>
            <l>Has tired of his own company?</l>
            <l>What one of Maeve's nine brawling sons</l>
            <l>Sick of his grave has wakened me?</l>
            <l>But let him keep his grave for once</l>
            <l>That I may find the sleep I have lost."</l>
            <l>What care I if you sleep or wake?</l>
            <l>But I'Il have no man call me ghost."</l>
            <l>Say what you please, but from daybreak</l>
            <l>I'll sleep another century."</l>
            <l>And I will talk before I sleep</l>
            <l>And drink before I talk.'</l>
            <l>And he</l>
            <l>Had dipped the wooden ladle deep</l>
            <l>Into the sleeper's tub of beer</l>
            <l>Had not the sleeper started up.</l>
            <l>Before you have dipped it in the beer</l>
            <l>I dragged from Goban's mountain-top</l>
            <l>I'll have assurance that you are able</l>
            <l>To value beer; no half-legged fool</l>
            <l>Shall dip his nose into my ladle</l>
            <l>Merely for stumbling on this hole</l>
            <l>In the bad hour before the dawn."</l>
            <l>Why beer is only beer.'</l>
            <l>"But say</l>
            <l>""I'll sleep until the winter's gone,</l>
            <l>Or maybe to Midsummer Day,''</l>
            <l>And drink and you will sleep that length.</l>
            <l>"I'd like to sleep till winter's gone</l>
            <l>Or till the sun is in his srrength.</l>
            <l>This blast has chilled me to the bone.'</l>
            <l>"I had no better plan at first.</l>
            <l>I thought to wait for that or this;</l>
            <l>Maybe the weather was accursed</l>
            <l>Or I had no woman there to kiss;</l>
            <l>So slept for half a year or so;</l>
            <l>But year by year I found that less</l>
            <l>Gave me such pleasure I'd forgo</l>
            <l>Even a half-hour's nothingness,</l>
            <l>And when at one year's end I found</l>
            <l>I had not waked a single minute,</l>
            <l>I chosc this burrow under ground.</l>
            <l>I'll sleep away all time within it:</l>
            <l>My sleep were now nine centuries</l>
            <l>But for those mornings when I find</l>
            <l>The lapwing at their foolish dies</l>
            <l>And the sheep bleating at the wind</l>
            <l>As when I also played the fool.'</l>
            <l>The beggar in a rage began</l>
            <l>Upon his hunkers in the hole,</l>
            <l>"It's plain that you are no right man</l>
            <l>To mock at everything I love</l>
            <l>As if it were not worth, the doing.</l>
            <l>I'd have a merry life enough</l>
            <l>If a good Easter wind were blowing,</l>
            <l>And though the winter wind is bad</l>
            <l>I should not be too down in the mouth</l>
            <l>For anything you did or said</l>
            <l>If but this wind were in the south.'</l>
            <l>"You cty aloud, O would 'twere spring</l>
            <l>Or that the wind would shift a point,</l>
            <l>And do not know that you would bring,</l>
            <l>If time were suppler in the joint,</l>
            <l>Neither the spring nor the south wind</l>
            <l>But the hour when you shall pass away</l>
            <l>And leave no smoking wick behind,</l>
            <l>For all life longs for the Last Day</l>
            <l>And there's no man but cocks his ear</l>
            <l>To know when Michael's trumpet cries</l>
            <l>"That flesh and bone may disappear,</l>
            <l>And souls as if they were but sighs,</l>
            <l>And there be nothing but God left;</l>
            <l>But, I aone being blessed keep</l>
            <l>Like some old rabbit to my cleft</l>
            <l>And wait Him in a drunken sleep.'</l>
            <l>He dipped his ladle in the tub</l>
            <l>And drank and yawned and stretched him out,</l>
            <l>The other shouted, "You would rob</l>
            <l>My life of every pleasant thought</l>
            <l>And every comfortable thing,</l>
            <l>And so take that and that." Thereon</l>
            <l>He gave him a great pummelling,</l>
            <l>But might have pummelled at a stone</l>
            <l>For all the sleeper knew or cared;</l>
            <l>And after heaped up stone on stone,</l>
            <l>And then, grown weary, prayed and cursed</l>
            <l>And heaped up stone on stone again,</l>
            <l>And prayed and cursed and cursed and bed</l>
            <l>From Maeve and all that juggling plain,</l>
            <l>Nor gave God thanks till overhead</l>
            <l>The clouds were brightening with the dawn.</l>
            <l>A SONG FROM "THE PLAYER QUEEN'</l>
            <l>MY mother dandled me and sang,</l>
            <l>"How young it is, how young!'</l>
            <l>And made a golden cradle</l>
            <l>That on a willow swung.</l>
            <l>"He went away,' my mother sang,</l>
            <l>"When I was brought to bed,'</l>
            <l>And all the while her needle pulled</l>
            <l>The gold and silver thread.</l>
            <l>She pulled the thread and bit the thread</l>
            <l>And made a golden gown,</l>
            <l>And wept because she had dreamt that I</l>
            <l>Was born to wear a crown.</l>
            <l>"When she was got,' my mother sang,</l>
            <l>I heard a sea-mew cry,</l>
            <l>And saw a flake of the yellow foam</l>
            <l>That dropped upon my thigh."</l>
            <l>How therefore could she help but braid</l>

            <l>The golden top of care?</l>
            <l>THE REALISTS</l>
            <l>HOPE that you may understand!</l>
            <l>What can books of men that wive</l>
            <l>In a dragon-guarded land,</l>
            <l>paintings of the dolphin-drawn</l>
            <l>Sea-nymphs in their pearly wagons</l>
            <l>Do, but awake a hope to live</l>
            <l>That had gone</l>
            <l>With the dragons?</l>
            <l>THE WITCH</l>
            <l>TOIL and grow rich,</l>
            <l>What's that but to lie</l>
            <l>With a foul witch</l>
            <l>And after, drained dry,</l>
            <l>To be brought</l>
            <l>To the chamber where</l>
            <l>Lies one long sought</l>
            <l>With despair?</l>
            <l>ME PEACOCK</l>
            <l>WHAT'S riches to him</l>
            <l>That has made a great peacock</l>
            <l>With the pride of his eye?</l>
            <l>The wind-beaten, stone-grey,</l>
            <l>And desolate Three Rock</l>
            <l>Would nourish his whim.</l>
            <l>Live he or die</l>
            <l>Amid wet rocks and heather,</l>
            <l>His ghost will be gay</l>
            <l>Adding feather to feather</l>
            <l>For the pride of his eye.</l>
            <l>THE MOUNTAIN TOMB</l>
            <l>POUR wine and dance if manhood still have pride,</l>
            <l>Bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom;</l>
            <l>The cataract smokes upon the mountain side,</l>
            <l>Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.</l>
            <l>Pull down the blinds, bring fiddle and clarionet</l>
            <l>That there be no foot silent in the room</l>
            <l>Nor mouth from kissing, nor from wine unwet;</l>
            <l>Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.</l>
            <l>In vain, in pain; the cataract still cries;</l>
            <l>The everlasting taper lights the gloom;</l>
            <l>All wisdom shut into his onyx eyes,</l>
            <l>Our Father Rosicross sleeps in his tomb.</l>
            <l>TO A CHILD DANCING IN THE WIND</l>
            <l>DANCE there upon the shore;</l>
            <l>What need have you to care</l>
            <l>For wind or water's roar?</l>
            <l>And tumble out your hair</l>
            <l>That the salt drops have wet;</l>
            <l>Being young you have not known</l>
            <l>The fool's triumph, nor yet</l>
            <l>Love lost as soon as won,</l>
            <l>Nor the best labourer dead</l>
            <l>And all the sheaves to bind.</l>
            <l>What need have you to dread</l>
            <l>The monstrous crying of wind!</l>
            <l>TWO YEARS LATER</l>
            <l>HAS no one said those daring</l>
            <l>Kind eyes should be more learn'd?</l>
            <l>Or warned you how despairing</l>
            <l>The moths are when they are burned?</l>
            <l>I could have warned you; but you are young,</l>
            <l>So we speak a different tongue.</l>
            <l>O you will take whatever's offered</l>
            <l>And dream that all the world's a friend,</l>
            <l>Suffer as your mother suffered,</l>
            <l>Be as broken in the end.</l>
            <l>But I am old and you are young,</l>
            <l>And I speak a barbarous tongue.</l>
            <l>A MEMORY OF YOUTH</l>
            <l>THE moments passed as at a play;</l>
            <l>I had the wisdom love brings forth;</l>
            <l>I had my share of mother-wit,</l>
            <l>And yet for all that I could say,</l>
            <l>And though I had her praise for it,</l>
            <l>A cloud blown from the cut-throat North</l>
            <l>Suddenly hid Love's moon away.</l>
            <l>Believing every word I said,</l>
            <l>I praised her body and her mind</l>
            <l>Till pride had made her eyes grow bright,</l>
            <l>And pleasure made her cheeks grow red,</l>
            <l>And vanity her footfall light,</l>
            <l>Yet we, for all that praise, could find</l>
            <l>Nothing but darkness overhead.</l>
            <l>We sat as silent as a stone,</l>
            <l>We knew, though she'd not said a word,</l>
            <l>That even the best of love must die,</l>
            <l>And had been savagely undone</l>
            <l>Were it not that Love upon the cry</l>
            <l>Of a most ridiculous little bird</l>
            <l>Tore from the clouds his marvellous moon.</l>
            <l>ALTHOUGH crowds gathered once if she but showed</l>
            <l>her face,</l>
            <l>And even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,</l>
            <l>Like some last courtier at a gypsy camping-place</l>
            <l>Babbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.</l>
            <l>These lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,</l>
            <l>These, these remain, but I record what-s gone. A crowd</l>
            <l>Will gather, and not know it walks the very street</l>
            <l>Whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning</l>
            <l>cloud</l>
            <l>FRIENDS</l>
            <l>NOW must I these three praise — </l>
            <l>Three women that have wrought</l>
            <l>What joy is in my days:</l>
            <l>One because no thought,</l>
            <l>Nor those unpassing cares,</l>
            <l>No, not in these fifteen</l>
            <l>Many-times-troubled years,</l>
            <l>Could ever come between</l>
            <l>Mind and delighted mind;</l>
            <l>And one because her hand</l>
            <l>Had strength that could unbind</l>
            <l>What none can understand,</l>
            <l>What none can have and thrive,</l>
            <l>Youth's dreamy load, till she</l>
            <l>So changed me that I live</l>
            <l>Labouring in ecstasy.</l>
            <l>And what of her that took</l>
            <l>All till my youth was gone</l>
            <l>With scarce a pitying look?</l>
            <l>How could I praise that one?</l>
            <l>When day begins to break</l>
            <l>I count my good and bad,</l>
            <l>Being wakeful for her sake,</l>
            <l>Remembering what she had,</l>
            <l>What eagle look still shows,</l>
            <l>While up from my heart's root</l>
            <l>So great a sweetness flows</l>
            <l>I shake from head to foot.</l>
            <l>THE COLD HEAVEN</l>
            <l>SUDDENLY I saw the cold and rook-delighting heaven</l>
            <l>That seemed as though ice burned and was but the</l>
            <l>more ice,</l>
            <l>And thereupon imagination and heart were driven</l>
            <l>So wild that every casual thought of that and this</l>
            <l>Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out</l>
            <l>of season</l>
            <l>With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;</l>
            <l>And I took all thc blame out of all sense and reason,</l>
            <l>Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,</l>
            <l>Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to</l>
            <l>quicken,</l>
            <l>Confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent</l>
            <l>Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken</l>
            <l>By the injustice of the skies for punishment?</l>
            <l>THAT THE NIGHT COME</l>
            <l>SHE lived in storm and strife,</l>
            <l>Her soul had such desire</l>
            <l>For what proud death may bring</l>
            <l>That it could not endure</l>
            <l>The common good of life,</l>
            <l>But lived as 'twere a king</l>
            <l>That packed his marriage day</l>
            <l>With banneret and pennon,</l>
            <l>Trumpet and kettledrum,</l>
            <l>And the outrageous cannon,</l>
            <l>To bundle time away</l>
            <l>That the night come.</l>
            <l>AN APPOINTMENT</l>
            <l>BEING out of heart with government</l>
            <l>I took a broken root to fling</l>
            <l>Where the proud, wayward squirrel went,</l>
            <l>Taking delight that he could spring;</l>
            <l>And he, with that low whinnying sound</l>
            <l>That is like laughter, sprang again</l>
            <l>And so to the other tree at a bound.</l>
            <l>Nor the tame will, nor timid brain,</l>
            <l>Nor heavy knitting of the brow</l>
            <l>Bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb</l>
            <l>And threw him up to laugh on the bough;</l>
            <l>No govermnent appointed him.</l>
            <l>THE MAGI</l>
            <l>NOW as at all times I can see in the mind's eye,</l>
            <l>In their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones</l>
            <l>Appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky</l>
            <l>With all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,</l>
            <l>And all their helms of Silver hovering side by side,</l>
            <l>And all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,</l>
            <l>Being by Calvary's turbulence unsatisfied,</l>
            <l>The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.</l>
            <l>THE DOLLS</l>
            <l>A DOLL in the doll-maker's house</l>
            <l>Looks at the cradle and bawls:</l>
            <l>"That is an insult to us.'</l>
            <l>But the oldest of all the dolls,</l>
            <l>Who had seen, being kept for show,</l>
            <l>Generations of his sort,</l>
            <l>Out-screams the whole shelf: 'Although</l>
            <l>There's not a man can report</l>
            <l>Evil of this place,</l>
            <l>The man and the woman bring</l>
            <l>Hither, to our disgrace,</l>
            <l>A noisy and filthy thing.'</l>
            <l>Hearing him groan and stretch</l>
            <l>The doll-maker's wife is aware</l>
            <l>Her husband has heard the wretch,</l>
            <l>And crouched by the arm of his chair,</l>
            <l>She murmurs into his ear,</l>
            <l>Head upon shoulder leant:</l>
            <l>"My dear, my dear, O dear.</l>
            <l>It was an accident.'</l>
            <l>A COAT</l>
            <l>I MADE my song a coat</l>
            <l>Covered with embroideries</l>
            <l>Out of old mythologies</l>
            <l>From heel to throat;</l>
            <l>But he fools caught it,</l>
            <l>Wore it in the world's eyes</l>
            <l>As though they'd wrought it.</l>
            <l>Song, let them take it,</l>
            <l>For there's more enterprise</l>
            <l>In walking naked.</l>
            <l>While I, from that reed-throated whisperer</l>
            <l>Who comes at need, although not now as once</l>
            <l>A clear articulation in the air,</l>
            <l>But inwardly, surmise companions</l>
            <l>Beyond the fling of the dull ass's hoof</l>
            <l> — Ben Jonson's phrase — and find when June is come</l>
            <l>At Kyle-na-no under that ancient roof</l>
            <l>A sterner conscience and a friendlier home,</l>
            <l>I can forgive even that wrong of wrongs,</l>
            <l>Those undreamt accidents that have made me</l>

               <l>An old man cocked his ear upon a bridge;</l>
               <l>He and his friend, their faces to the South,</l>
               <l>Had trod the uneven road. Their hoots were soiled,</l>
               <l>Their Connemara cloth worn out of shape;</l>
               <l>They had kept a steady pace as though their beds,</l>
               <l>Despite a dwindling and late-risen moon,</l>
               <l>Were distant still. An old man cocked his ear.</l>
               <l>Aherne. What made that Sound?</l>
               <l>Robartes. A rat or water-hen</l>
               <l>Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream.</l>
               <l>We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower,</l>
               <l>And the light proves that he is reading still.</l>
               <l>He has found, after the manner of his kind,</l>
               <l>Mere images; chosen this place to live in</l>
               <l>Because, it may be, of the candle-light</l>
               <l>From the far tower where Milton's Platonist</l>
               <l>Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince:</l>
               <l>The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,</l>
               <l>An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil;</l>
               <l>And now he seeks in book or manuscript</l>
               <l>What he shall never find.</l>
               <l>Aherne. Why should not you</l>
               <l>Who know it all ring at his door, and speak</l>
               <l>Just truth enough to show that his whole life</l>
               <l>Will scarcely find for him a broken crust</l>
               <l>Of all those truths that are your daily bread;</l>
               <l>And when you have spoken take the roads again?</l>
               <l>Robartes. He wrote of me in that extravagant style</l>
               <l>He had learnt from pater, and to round his tale</l>
               <l>Said I was dead; and dead I choose to be.</l>
               <l>Aherne. Sing me the changes of the moon once more;</l>
               <l>True song, though speech: `mine author sung it me.'</l>
               <l>Robartes. Twenty-and-eight the phases of the moon,</l>
               <l>The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents,</l>
               <l>Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty</l>
               <l>The cradles that a man must needs be rocked in:</l>
               <l>For there's no human life at the full or the dark.</l>
               <l>From the first crescent to the half, the dream</l>
               <l>But summons to adventure and the man</l>
               <l>Is always happy like a bird or a beast;</l>
               <l>But while the moon is rounding towards the full</l>
               <l>He follows whatever whim's most difficult</l>
               <l>Among whims not impossible, and though scarred.</l>
               <l>As with the cat-o'-nine-tails of the mind,</l>
               <l>His body moulded from within his body</l>
               <l>Grows comelier. Eleven pass, and then</l>
               <l>Athene takes Achilles by the hair,</l>
               <l>Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born,</l>
               <l>Because the hero's crescent is the twelfth.</l>
               <l>And yet, twice born, twice buried, grow he must,</l>
               <l>Before the full moon, helpless as a worm.</l>
               <l>The thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war</l>
               <l>In its own being, and when that war's begun</l>
               <l>There is no muscle in the arm; and after,</l>
               <l>Under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon,</l>
               <l>The soul begins to tremble into stillness,</l>
               <l>To die into the labyrinth of itself!</l>
               <l>Aherne. Sing out the song; sing to the end, and sing</l>
               <l>The strange reward of all that discipline.</l>
               <l>Robartes. All thought becomes an image and the soul</l>
               <l>Becomes a body: that body and that soul</l>
               <l>Too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle,</l>
               <l>Too lonely for the traffic of the world:</l>
               <l>Body and soul cast out and cast away</l>
               <l>Beyond the visible world.</l>
               <l>Aherne. All dreams of the soul</l>
               <l>End in a beautiful man's or woman's body.</l>
               <l>Robartes, Have you not always known it?</l>
               <l>Aherne. The song will have it</l>
               <l>That those that we have loved got their long fingers</l>
               <l>From death, and wounds, or on Sinai's top,</l>
               <l>Or from some bloody whip in their own hands.</l>
               <l>They ran from cradle to cradle till at last</l>
               <l>Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness</l>
               <l>Of body and soul.</l>
               <l>Robartes. The lover's heart knows that.</l>
               <l>Aherne. It must be that the terror in their eyes</l>
               <l>Is memory or foreknowledge of the hour</l>
               <l>When all is fed with light and heaven is bare.</l>
               <l>Robartes. When the moon's full those creatures of the</l>
               <l>full</l>
               <l>Are met on the waste hills by countrymen</l>
               <l>Who shudder and hurry by: body and soul</l>
               <l>Estranged amid the strangeness of themselves,</l>
               <l>Caught up in contemplation, the mind's eye</l>
               <l>Fixed upon images that once were thought;</l>
               <l>For separate, perfect, and immovable</l>
               <l>Images can break the solitude</l>
               <l>Of lovely, satisfied, indifferent eyes.</l>
               <l>And thereupon with aged, high-pitched voice</l>
               <l>Aherne laughed, thinking of the man within,</l>
               <l>His sleepless candle and laborious pen.</l>
               <l>Robartes. And after that the crumbling of the moon.</l>
               <l>The soul remembering its loneliness</l>
               <l>Shudders in many cradles; all is changed,</l>
               <l>It would be the world's servant, and as it serves,</l>
               <l>Choosing whatever task's most difficult</l>
               <l>Among tasks not impossible, it takes</l>
               <l>Upon the body and upon the soul</l>
               <l>The coarseness of the drudge.</l>
               <l>Aherne. Before the full</l>
               <l>It sought itself and afterwards the world.</l>
               <l>Robartes. Because you are forgotten, half out of life,</l>
               <l>And never wrote a book, your thought is clear.</l>
               <l>Reformer, merchant, statesman, learned man,</l>
               <l>Dutiful husband, honest wife by turn,</l>
               <l>Cradle upon cradle, and all in flight and all</l>
               <l>Deformed because there is no deformity</l>
               <l>But saves us from a dream.</l>
               <l>Aherne. And what of those</l>
               <l>That the last servile crescent has set free?</l>
               <l>Robartes. Because all dark, like those that are all light,</l>
               <l>They are cast beyond the verge, and in a cloud,</l>
               <l>Crying to one another like the bats;</l>
               <l>And having no desire they cannot tell</l>
               <l>What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph</l>
               <l>At the perfection of one's own obedience;</l>
               <l>And yet they speak what's blown into the mind;</l>
               <l>Deformed beyond deformity, unformed,</l>
               <l>Insipid as the dough before it is baked,</l>
               <l>They change their bodies at a word.</l>
               <l>Aherne. And then?</l>
               <l>Robartes. When all the dough has been so kneaded up</l>
               <l>That it can take what form cook Nature fancies,</l>
               <l>The first thin crescent is wheeled round once more.</l>
               <l>Aherne. But the escape; the song's not finished yet.</l>
               <l>Robartes. Hunchback and Saint and Fool are the last</l>
               <l>crescents.</l>
               <l>The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow</l>
               <l>Out of the up and down, the wagon-wheel</l>
               <l>Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter — </l>
               <l>Out of that raving tide — is drawn betwixt</l>
               <l>Deformity of body and of mind.</l>
               <l>Aherne. Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell,</l>
               <l>Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall</l>
               <l>Beside the castle door, where all is stark</l>
               <l>Austerity, a place set out for wisdom</l>
               <l>That he will never find; I'd play a part;</l>
               <l>He would never know me after all these years</l>
               <l>But take me for some drunken countryman:</l>
               <l>I'd stand and mutter there until he caught</l>
               <l>`Hunchback and Saint and Fool,' and that they came</l>
               <l>Under the three last crescents of the moon.</l>
               <l>And then I'd stagger out. He'd crack his wits</l>
               <l>Day after day, yet never find the meaning.</l>
               <l>And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard</l>
               <l>Should be so simple — a bat rose from the hazels</l>
               <l>And circled round him with its squeaky cry,</l>
               <l>The light in the tower window was put out.</l>
               <l>THE CAT AND THE MOON</l>
               <l>THE cat went here and there</l>
               <l>And the moon spun round like a top,</l>
               <l>And the nearest kin of the moon,</l>
               <l>The creeping cat, looked up.</l>
               <l>Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,</l>
               <l>For, wander and wail as he would,</l>
               <l>The pure cold light in the sky</l>
               <l>Troubled his animal blood.</l>
               <l>Minnaloushe runs in the grass</l>
               <l>Lifting his delicate feet.</l>
               <l>Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?</l>
               <l>When two close kindred meet.</l>
               <l>What better than call a dance?</l>
               <l>Maybe the moon may learn,</l>
               <l>Tired of that courtly fashion,</l>
               <l>A new dance turn.</l>
               <l>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</l>
               <l>From moonlit place to place,</l>
               <l>The sacred moon overhead</l>
               <l>Has taken a new phase.</l>
               <l>Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils</l>
               <l>Will pass from change to change,</l>
               <l>And that from round to crescent,</l>
               <l>From crescent to round they range?</l>
               <l>Minnaloushe creeps through the grass</l>
               <l>Alone, important and wise,</l>
               <l>And lifts to the changing moon</l>
               <l>His changing eyes.</l>
               <l>THE SAINT AND THE HUNCHBACK</l>
               <l>Hunchback. Stand up and lift your hand and bless</l>
               <l>A man that finds great bitterness</l>
               <l>In thinking of his lost renown.</l>
               <l>A Roman Caesar is held down</l>
               <l>Under this hump.</l>
               <l>Saint. God tries each man</l>
               <l>According to a different plan.</l>
               <l>I shall not cease to bless because</l>
               <l>I lay about me with the taws</l>
               <l>That night and morning I may thrash</l>
               <l>Greek Alexander from my flesh,</l>
               <l>Augustus Caesar, and after these</l>
               <l>That great rogue Alcibiades.</l>
               <l>Hunchback. To all that in your flesh have stood</l>
               <l>And blessed, I give my gratitude,</l>
               <l>Honoured by all in their degrees,</l>
               <l>But most to Alcibiades.</l>
               <l>TWO SONGS OF A FOOL</l>
               <l>   I</l>
               <l>A SPECKLED cat and a tame hare</l>
               <l>Eat at my hearthstone</l>
               <l>And sleep there;</l>
               <l>And both look up to me alone</l>
               <l>For learning and defence</l>
               <l>As I look up to providence.</l>
               <l>I start out of my sleep to think</l>
               <l>Some day I may forget</l>
               <l>Their food and drink;</l>
               <l>Or, the house door left unshut,</l>
               <l>The hare may run till it's found</l>
               <l>The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.</l>
               <l>I bear a burden that might well try</l>
               <l>Men that do all by rule,</l>
               <l>And what can I</l>
               <l>That am a wandering-witted fool</l>
               <l>But pray to God that He ease</l>
               <l>My great responsibilities?</l>
               <l>I slept on my three-legged stool by the fire.</l>
               <l>The speckled cat slept on my knee;</l>
               <l>We never thought to enquire</l>
               <l>Where the brown hare might be,</l>
               <l>And whether the door were shut.</l>
               <l>Who knows how she drank the wind</l>
               <l>Stretched up on two legs from the mat,</l>
               <l>Before she had settled her mind</l>
               <l>To drum with her heel and to leap?</l>
               <l>Had I but awakened from sleep</l>
               <l>And called her name, she had heard.</l>
               <l>It may be, and had not stirred,</l>
               <l>That now, it may be, has found</l>
               <l>The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.</l>
               <l>ANOTHER SONG OF A FOOL</l>
               <l>THIS great purple butterfly,</l>
               <l>In the prison of my hands,</l>
               <l>Has a learning in his eye</l>
               <l>Not a poor fool understands.</l>
               <l>Once he lived a schoolmaster</l>
               <l>With a stark, denying look;</l>
               <l>A string of scholars went in fear</l>
               <l>Of his great birch and his great book.</l>
               <l>Like the clangour of a bell,</l>
               <l>Sweet and harsh, harsh and sweet.</l>
               <l>That is how he learnt so well</l>
               <l>To take the roses for his meat.</l>
               <l>THE DOUBLE VISION OF MICHAEL ROBARTES</l>
               <l>   I</l>
               <l>ON the grey rock of Cashel the mind's eye</l>
               <l>Has called up the cold spirits that are born</l>
               <l>When the old moon is vanished from the sky</l>
               <l>And the new still hides her horn.</l>
               <l>Under blank eyes and fingers never still</l>
               <l>The particular is pounded till it is man.</l>
               <l>When had I my own will?</l>
               <l>O not since life began.</l>
               <l>Constrained, arraigned, baffled, bent and unbent</l>
               <l>By these wire-jointed jaws and limbs of wood,</l>
               <l>Themselves obedient,</l>
               <l>Knowing not evil and good;</l>
               <l>Obedient to some hidden magical breath.</l>
               <l>They do not even feel, so abstract are they.</l>
               <l>So dead beyond our death,</l>
               <l>Triumph that we obey.</l>
               <l>On the grey rock of Cashel I suddenly saw</l>
               <l>A Sphinx with woman breast and lion paw.</l>
               <l>A Buddha, hand at rest,</l>
               <l>Hand lifted up that blest;</l>
               <l>And right between these two a girl at play</l>
               <l>That, it may be, had danced her life away,</l>
               <l>For now being dead it seemed</l>
               <l>That she of dancing dreamed.</l>
               <l>Although I saw it all in the mind's eye</l>
               <l>There can be nothing solider till I die;</l>
               <l>I saw by the moon's light</l>
               <l>Now at its fifteenth night.</l>
               <l>One lashed her tail; her eyes lit by the moon</l>
               <l>Gazed upon all things known, all things unknown,</l>
               <l>In triumph of intellect</l>
               <l>With motionless head erect.</l>
               <l>That other's moonlit eyeballs never moved,</l>
               <l>Being fixed on all things loved, all things unloved.</l>
               <l>Yet little peace he had,</l>
               <l>For those that love are sad.</l>
               <l>0 little did they care who danced between,</l>
               <l>And little she by whom her dance was seen</l>
               <l>So she had outdanced thought.</l>
               <l>Body perfection brought,</l>
               <l>For what but eye and ear silence the mind</l>
               <l>With the minute particulars of mankind?</l>
               <l>Mind moved yet seemed to stop</l>
               <l>As 'twere a spinning-top.</l>
               <l>In contemplation had those three so wrought</l>
               <l>Upon a moment, and so stretched it out</l>
               <l>That they, time overthrown,</l>
               <l>Were dead yet flesh and bone.</l>
               <l>I knew that I had seen, had seen at last</l>
               <l>That girl my unremembering nights hold fast</l>
               <l>Or else my dreams that fly</l>
               <l>If I should rub an eye,</l>
               <l>And yet in flying fling into my meat</l>
               <l>A crazy juice that makes the pulses beat</l>
               <l>As though I had been undone</l>
               <l>By Homer's Paragon</l>
               <l>Who never gave the burning town a thought;</l>
               <l>To such a pitch of folly I am brought,</l>
               <l>Being caught between the pull</l>
               <l>Of the dark moon and the full,</l>
               <l>The commonness of thought and images</l>
               <l>That have the frenzy of our western seas.</l>
               <l>Thereon I made my moan,</l>
               <l>And after kissed a stone,</l>
               <l>And after that arranged it in a song</l>
               <l>Seeing that I, ignorant for So long,</l>
               <l>Had been rewarded thus</l>
               <l>In Cormac's ruined house.</l>

            <l>MICHAEL ROBARTES AND THE DANCER</l>
            <l>He. Opinion is not worth a rush;</l>
            <l>In this altar-piece the knight,</l>
            <l>Who grips his long spear so to push</l>
            <l>That dragon through the fading light,</l>
            <l>Loved the lady; and it's plain</l>
            <l>The half-dead dragon was her thought,</l>
            <l>That every morning rose again</l>
            <l>And dug its claws and shrieked and fought.</l>
            <l>Could the impossible come to pass</l>
            <l>She would have time to turn her eyes,</l>
            <l>Her lover thought, upon the glass</l>
            <l>And on the instant would grow wise.</l>
            <l>She. You mean they argued.</l>
            <l>He. Put it so;</l>
            <l>But bear in mind your lover's wage</l>
            <l>Is what your looking-glass can show,</l>
            <l>And that he will turn green with rage</l>
            <l>At all that is not pictured there.</l>
            <l>She. May I not put myself to college?</l>
            <l>He. Go pluck Athene by the hair;</l>
            <l>For what mere book can grant a knowledge</l>
            <l>With an impassioned gravity</l>
            <l>Appropriate to that beating breast,</l>
            <l>That vigorous thigh, that dreaming eye?</l>
            <l>And may the Devil take the rest.</l>
            <l>She. And must no beautiful woman be</l>
            <l>Learned like a man?</l>
            <l>He.  Paul Veronese</l>
            <l>And all his sacred company</l>
            <l>Imagined bodies all their days</l>
            <l>By the lagoon you love so much,</l>
            <l>For proud, soft, ceremonious proof</l>
            <l>That all must come to sight and touch;</l>
            <l>While Michael Angelo's Sistine roof,</l>
            <l>His "Morning' and his "Night' disclose</l>
            <l>How sinew that has been pulled tight,</l>
            <l>Or it may be loosened in repose,</l>
            <l>Can rule by supernatural right</l>
            <l>Yet be but sinew.</l>
            <l>She. I have heard said</l>
            <l>There is great danger in the body.</l>
            <l>He. Did God in portioning wine and bread</l>
            <l>Give man His thought or His mere body?</l>
            <l>She. My wretched dragon is perplexed.</l>
            <l>Hec. I have principles to prove me right.</l>
            <l>It follows from this Latin text</l>
            <l>That blest souls are not composite,</l>
            <l>And that all beautiful women may</l>
            <l>Live in uncomposite blessedness,</l>
            <l>And lead us to the like — if they</l>
            <l>Will banish every thought, unless</l>
            <l>The lineaments that please their view</l>
            <l>When the long looking-glass is full,</l>
            <l>Even from the foot-sole think it too.</l>
            <l>She. They say such different things at school.</l>
            <l>SOLOMON AND THE WITCH</l>
            <l>AND thus declared that Arab lady:</l>
            <l>"Last night, where under the wild moon</l>
            <l>On grassy mattress I had laid me,</l>
            <l>Within my arms great Solomon,</l>
            <l>I suddenly cried out in a strange tongue</l>
            <l>Not his, not mine."</l>
            <l>Who understood</l>
            <l>Whatever has been said, sighed, sung,</l>
            <l>Howled, miau-d, barked, brayed, belled, yelled, cried,</l>
            <l>crowed,</l>
            <l>Thereon replied: "A cockerel</l>
            <l>Crew from a blossoming apple bough</l>
            <l>Three hundred years before the Fall,</l>
            <l>And never crew again till now,</l>
            <l>And would not now but that he thought,</l>
            <l>Chance being at one with Choice at last,</l>
            <l>All that the brigand apple brought</l>
            <l>And this foul world were dead at last.</l>
            <l>He that crowed out eternity</l>
            <l>Thought to have crowed it in again.</l>
            <l>For though love has a spider's eye</l>
            <l>To find out some appropriate pain — </l>
            <l>Aye, though all passion's in the glance — </l>
            <l>For every nerve, and tests a lover</l>
            <l>With cruelties of Choice and Chance;</l>
            <l>And when at last that murder's over</l>
            <l>Maybe the bride-bed brings despair,</l>
            <l>For each an imagined image brings</l>
            <l>And finds a real image there;</l>
            <l>Yet the world ends when these two things,</l>
            <l>Though several, are a single light,</l>
            <l>When oil and wick are burned in one;</l>
            <l>Therefore a blessed moon last night</l>
            <l>Gave Sheba to her Solomon.'</l>
            <l>"Yet the world stays.'</l>
            <l>"If that be so,</l>
            <l>Your cockerel found us in the wrong</l>
            <l>Although he thought it. worth a crow.</l>
            <l>Maybe an image is too strong</l>
            <l>Or maybe is not strong enough.'</l>
            <l>"The night has fallen; not a sound</l>
            <l>In the forbidden sacred grove</l>
            <l>Unless a petal hit the ground,</l>
            <l>Nor any human sight within it</l>
            <l>But the crushed grass where we have lain!</l>
            <l>And the moon is wilder every minute.</l>
            <l>O! Solomon! let us try again.'</l>
            <l>AN IMAGE FROM A PAST LIFE</l>
            <l>He. Never until this night have I been stirred.</l>
            <l>The elaborate starlight throws a reflection</l>
            <l>On the dark stream,</l>
            <l>Till all the eddies gleam;</l>
            <l>And thereupon there comes that scream</l>
            <l>From terrified, invisible beast or bird:</l>
            <l>Image of poignant recollection.</l>
            <l>She. An image of my heart that is smitten through</l>
            <l>Out of all likelihood, or reason,</l>
            <l>And when at last,</l>
            <l>Youth's bitterness being past,</l>
            <l>I had thought that all my days were cast</l>
            <l>Amid most lovely places; smitten as though</l>
            <l>It had not learned its lesson.</l>
            <l>He. Why have you laid your hands upon my eyes?</l>
            <l>What can have suddenly alarmed you</l>
            <l>Whereon 'twere best</l>
            <l>My eyes should never rest?</l>
            <l>What is there but the slowly fading west,</l>
            <l>The river imaging the flashing skies,</l>
            <l>All that to this moment charmed you?</l>
            <l>She. A Sweetheart from another life floats there</l>
            <l>As though she had been forced to linger</l>
            <l>From vague distress</l>
            <l>Or arrogant loveliness,</l>
            <l>Merely to loosen out a tress</l>
            <l>Among the starry eddies of her hair</l>
            <l>Upon the paleness of a finger.</l>
            <l>He. But why should you grow suddenly afraid</l>
            <l>And start — I at your shoulder — </l>
            <l>Imagining</l>
            <l>That any night could bring</l>
            <l>An image up, or anything</l>
            <l>Even to eyes that beauty had driven mad,</l>
            <l>But images to make me fonder?</l>
            <l>She. Now She has thrown her arms above her head;</l>
            <l>Whether she threw them up to flout me,</l>
            <l>Or but to find,</l>
            <l>Now that no fingers bind,</l>
            <l>That her hair streams upon the wind,</l>
            <l>I do not know, that know I am afraid</l>
            <l>Of the hovering thing night brought me.</l>
            <l>UNDER SATURN</l>
            <l>DO not because this day I have grown saturnine</l>
            <l>Imagine that lost love, inseparable from my thought</l>
            <l>Because I have no other youth, can make me pine;</l>
            <l>For how should I forget the wisdom that you brought,</l>
            <l>The comfort that you made? Although my wits have gone</l>
            <l>On a fantastic ride, my horse's flanks are spurred</l>
            <l>By childish memories of an old cross Pollexfen,</l>
            <l>And of a Middleton, whose name you never heard,</l>
            <l>And of a red-haired Yeats whose looks, although he died</l>
            <l>Before my time, seem like a vivid memory.</l>
            <l>You heard that labouring man who had served my</l>
            <l>people. He said</l>
            <l>Upon the open road, near to the Sligo quay — </l>
            <l>No, no, not said, but cried it out — "You have come</l>
            <l>again,</l>
            <l>And surely after twenty years it was time to come.'</l>
            <l>I am thinking of a child's vow sworn in vain</l>
            <l>Never to leave that valley his fathers called their home.</l>
            <l>EASTER 1916</l>
            <l>I HAVE met them at close of day</l>
            <l>Coming with vivid faces</l>
            <l>From counter or desk among grey</l>
            <l>Eighteenth-century houses.</l>
            <l>I have passed with a nod of the head</l>
            <l>Or polite meaningless words,</l>
            <l>Or have lingered awhile and said</l>
            <l>Polite meaningless words,</l>
            <l>And thought before I had done</l>
            <l>Of a mocking tale or a gibe</l>
            <l>To please a companion</l>
            <l>Around the fire at the club,</l>
            <l>Being certain that they and I</l>
            <l>But lived where motley is worn:</l>
            <l>All changed, changed utterly:</l>
            <l>A terrible beauty is born.</l>
            <l>That woman's days were spent</l>
            <l>In ignorant good-will,</l>
            <l>Her nights in argument</l>
            <l>Until her voice grew shrill.</l>
            <l>What voice more sweet than hers</l>
            <l>When, young and beautiful,</l>
            <l>She rode to harriers?</l>
            <l>This man had kept a school</l>
            <l>And rode our winged horse;</l>
            <l>This other his helper and friend</l>
            <l>Was coming into his force;</l>
            <l>He might have won fame in the end,</l>
            <l>So sensitive his nature seemed,</l>
            <l>So daring and sweet his thought.</l>
            <l>This other man I had dreamed</l>
            <l>A drunken, vainglorious lout.</l>
            <l>He had done most bitter wrong</l>
            <l>To some who are near my heart,</l>
            <l>Yet I number him in the song;</l>
            <l>He, too, has resigned his part</l>
            <l>In the casual comedy;</l>
            <l>He, too, has been changed in his turn,</l>
            <l>Transformed utterly:</l>
            <l>A terrible beauty is born.</l>
            <l>Hearts with one purpose alone</l>
            <l>Through summer and winter seem</l>
            <l>Enchanted to a stone</l>
            <l>To trouble the living stream.</l>
            <l>The horse that comes from the road.</l>
            <l>The rider, the birds that range</l>
            <l>From cloud to tumbling cloud,</l>
            <l>Minute by minute they change;</l>
            <l>A shadow of cloud on the stream</l>
            <l>Changes minute by minute;</l>
            <l>A horse-hoof slides on the brim,</l>
            <l>And a horse plashes within it;</l>
            <l>The long-legged moor-hens dive,</l>
            <l>And hens to moor-cocks call;</l>
            <l>Minute by minute they live:</l>
            <l>The stone's in the midst of all.</l>
            <l>Too long a sacrifice</l>
            <l>Can make a stone of the heart.</l>
            <l>O when may it suffice?</l>
            <l>That is Heaven's part, our part</l>
            <l>To murmur name upon name,</l>
            <l>As a mother names her child</l>
            <l>When sleep at last has come</l>
            <l>On limbs that had run wild.</l>
            <l>What is it but nightfall?</l>
            <l>No, no, not night but death;</l>
            <l>Was it needless death after all?</l>
            <l>For England may keep faith</l>
            <l>For all that is done and said.</l>
            <l>We know their dream; enough</l>
            <l>To know they dreamed and are dead;</l>
            <l>And what if excess of love</l>
            <l>Bewildered them till they died?</l>
            <l>I write it out in a verse — </l>
            <l>MacDonagh and MacBride</l>
            <l>And Connolly and pearse</l>
            <l>Now and in time to be,</l>
            <l>Wherever green is worn,</l>
            <l>Are changed, changed utterly:</l>
            <l>A terrible beauty is born.</l>
            <l>SIXTEEN DEAD MEN</l>
            <l>O BUT we talked at large before</l>
            <l>The sixteen men were shot,</l>
            <l>But who can talk of give and take,</l>
            <l>What should be and what not</l>
            <l>While those dead men are loitering there</l>
            <l>To stir the boiling pot?</l>
            <l>You say that we should still the land</l>
            <l>Till Germany's overcome;</l>
            <l>But who is there to argue that</l>
            <l>Now Pearse is deaf and dumb?</l>
            <l>And is their logic to outweigh</l>
            <l>MacDonagh's bony thumb?</l>
            <l>how could you dream they'd listen</l>
            <l>That have an ear alone</l>
            <l>For those new comrades they have found,</l>
            <l>Lord Edward and Wolfe Tone,</l>
            <l>Or meddle with our give and take</l>
            <l>That converse bone to bone?</l>
            <l>THE ROSE TREE</l>
            <l>'O WORDS are lightly spoken,'</l>
            <l>Said Pearse to Connolly,</l>
            <l>'Maybe a breath of politic words</l>
            <l>Has withered our Rose Tree;</l>
            <l>Or maybe but a wind that blows</l>
            <l>Across the bitter sea.'</l>
            <l>"It needs to be but watered,'</l>
            <l>James Connolly replied,</l>
            <l>"To make the green come out again</l>
            <l>And spread on every side,</l>
            <l>And shake the blossom from the bud</l>
            <l>To be the garden's pride.'</l>
            <l>"But where can we draw water,'</l>
            <l>Said Pearse to Connolly,</l>
            <l>"When all the wells are parched away?</l>
            <l>O plain as plain can be</l>
            <l>There's nothing but our own red blood</l>
            <l>Can make a right Rose Tree.'</l>
            <l>ON A POLITICAL PRISONER</l>
            <l>SHE that but little patience knew,</l>
            <l>From childhood on, had now so much</l>
            <l>A grey gull lost its fear and flew</l>
            <l>Down to her cell and there alit,</l>
            <l>And there endured her fingers' touch</l>
            <l>And from her fingers ate its bit.</l>
            <l>Did she in touching that lone wing</l>
            <l>Recall the years before her mind</l>
            <l>Became a bitter, an abstract thing,</l>
            <l>Her thought some popular enmity:</l>
            <l>Blind and leader of the blind</l>
            <l>Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?</l>
            <l>When long ago I saw her ride</l>
            <l>Under Ben Bulben to the meet,</l>
            <l>The beauty of her country-side</l>
            <l>With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,</l>
            <l>She seemed to have grown clean and sweet</l>
            <l>Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:</l>
            <l>Sea-borne, or balanced on the air</l>
            <l>When first it sprang out of the nest</l>
            <l>Upon some lofty rock to stare</l>
            <l>Upon the cloudy canopy,</l>
            <l>While under its storm-beaten breast</l>
            <l>Cried out the hollows of the sea.</l>
            <l>THE LEADERS OF THE CROWD</l>
            <l>THEY must to keep their certainty accuse</l>
            <l>All that are different of a base intent;</l>
            <l>Pull down established honour; hawk for news</l>
            <l>Whatever their loose fantasy invent</l>
            <l>And murmur it with bated breath, as though</l>
            <l>The abounding gutter had been Helicon</l>
            <l>Or calumny a song. How can they know</l>
            <l>Truth flourishes where the student's lamp has shone,</l>
            <l>And there alone, that have no Solitude?</l>
            <l>So the crowd come they care not what may come.</l>
            <l>They have loud music, hope every day renewed</l>
            <l>And heartier loves; that lamp is from the tomb.</l>
            <l>TOWARDS BREAK OF DAY</l>
            <l>WAS it the double of my dream</l>
            <l>The woman that by me lay</l>
            <l>Dreamed, or did we halve a dream</l>
            <l>Under the first cold gleam of day?</l>
            <l>I thought: "There is a waterfall</l>
            <l>Upon Ben Bulben side</l>
            <l>That all my childhood counted dear;</l>
            <l>Were I to travel far and wide</l>
            <l>I could not find a thing so dear.'</l>
            <l>My memories had magnified</l>
            <l>So many times childish delight.</l>
            <l>I would have touched it like a child</l>
            <l>But knew my finger could but have touched</l>
            <l>Cold stone and water. I grew wild.</l>
            <l>Even accusing Heaven because</l>
            <l>It had set down among its laws:</l>
            <l>Nothing that we love over-much</l>
            <l>Is ponderable to our touch.</l>
            <l>I dreamed towards break of day,</l>
            <l>The cold blown spray in my nostril.</l>
            <l>But she that beside me lay</l>
            <l>Had watched in bitterer sleep</l>
            <l>The marvellous stag of Arthur,</l>
            <l>That lofty white stag, leap</l>
            <l>From mountain steep to steep.</l>
            <l>DEMON AND BEAST</l>
            <l>FOR certain minutes at the least</l>
            <l>That crafty demon and that loud beast</l>
            <l>That plague me day and night</l>
            <l>Ran out of my sight;</l>
            <l>Though I had long perned in the gyre,</l>
            <l>Between my hatred and desire.</l>
            <l>I saw my freedom won</l>
            <l>And all laugh in the sun.</l>
            <l>The glittering eyes in a death's head</l>
            <l>Of old Luke Wadding's portrait said</l>
            <l>Welcome, and the Ormondes all</l>
            <l>Nodded upon the wall,</l>
            <l>And even Strafford smiled as though</l>
            <l>It made him happier to know</l>
            <l>I understood his plan.</l>
            <l>Now that the loud beast ran</l>
            <l>There was no portrait in the Gallery</l>
            <l>But beckoned to sweet company,</l>
            <l>For all men's thoughts grew clear</l>
            <l>Being dear as mine are dear.</l>
            <l>But soon a tear-drop started up,</l>
            <l>For aimless joy had made me stop</l>
            <l>Beside the little lake</l>
            <l>To watch a white gull take</l>
            <l>A bit of bread thrown up into the air;</l>
            <l>Now gyring down and perning there</l>
            <l>He splashed where an absurd</l>
            <l>Portly green-pated bird</l>
            <l>Shook off the water from his back;</l>
            <l>Being no more demoniac</l>
            <l>A stupid happy creature</l>
            <l>Could rouse my whole nature.</l>
            <l>Yet I am certain as can be</l>
            <l>That every natural victory</l>
            <l>Belongs to beast or demon,</l>
            <l>That never yet had freeman</l>
            <l>Right mastery of natural things,</l>
            <l>And that mere growing old, that brings</l>
            <l>Chilled blood, this sweetness brought;</l>
            <l>Yet have no dearer thought</l>
            <l>Than that I may find out a way</l>
            <l>To make it linger half a day.</l>
            <l>O what a sweetness strayed</l>
            <l>Through barren Thebaid,</l>
            <l>Or by the Mareotic sea</l>
            <l>When that exultant Anthony</l>
            <l>And twice a thousand more</l>
            <l>Starved upon the shore</l>
            <l>And withered to a bag of bones!</l>
            <l>What had the Caesars but their thrones?</l>
            <l>THE SECOND COMING</l>
            <l>TURNING and turning in the widening gyre</l>
            <l>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</l>
            <l>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</l>
            <l>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</l>
            <l>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere</l>
            <l>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</l>
            <l>The best lack all conviction, while the worst</l>
            <l>Are full of passionate intensity.</l>
            <l>Surely some revelation is at hand;</l>
            <l>Surely the Second Coming is at hand.</l>
            <l>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out</l>
            <l>When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi</l>
            <l>Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert</l>
            <l>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,</l>
            <l>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,</l>
            <l>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it</l>
            <l>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.</l>
            <l>The darkness drops again; but now I know</l>
            <l>That twenty centuries of stony sleep</l>
            <l>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,</l>
            <l>And what rough beast, its hour come round at laSt,</l>
            <l>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</l>
            <l>A PRAYER FOR MY DAUGHTER</l>
            <l>ONCE more the storm is howling, and half hid</l>
            <l>Under this cradle-hood and coverlid</l>
            <l>My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle</l>
            <l>But Gregory's wood and one bare hill</l>
            <l>Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind.</l>
            <l>Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;</l>
            <l>And for an hour I have walked and prayed</l>
            <l>Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.</l>
            <l>I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour</l>
            <l>And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,</l>
            <l>And-under the arches of the bridge, and scream</l>
            <l>In the elms above the flooded stream;</l>
            <l>Imagining in excited reverie</l>
            <l>That the future years had come,</l>
            <l>Dancing to a frenzied drum,</l>
            <l>Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.</l>
            <l>May she be granted beauty and yet not</l>
            <l>Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,</l>
            <l>Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,</l>
            <l>Being made beautiful overmuch,</l>
            <l>Consider beauty a sufficient end,</l>
            <l>Lose natural kindness and maybe</l>
            <l>The heart-revealing intimacy</l>
            <l>That chooses right, and never find a friend.</l>
            <l>Helen being chosen found life flat and dull</l>
            <l>And later had much trouble from a fool,</l>
            <l>While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,</l>
            <l>Being fatherless could have her way</l>
            <l>Yet chose a bandy-legged smith for man.</l>
            <l>It's certain that fine women eat</l>
            <l>A crazy salad with their meat</l>
            <l>Whereby the Horn of plenty is undone.</l>
            <l>In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;</l>
            <l>Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned</l>
            <l>By those that are not entirely beautiful;</l>
            <l>Yet many, that have played the fool</l>
            <l>For beauty's very self, has charm made wisc.</l>
            <l>And many a poor man that has roved,</l>
            <l>Loved and thought himself beloved,</l>
            <l>From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.</l>
            <l>May she become a flourishing hidden tree</l>
            <l>That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,</l>
            <l>And have no business but dispensing round</l>
            <l>Their magnanimities of sound,</l>
            <l>Nor but in merriment begin a chase,</l>
            <l>Nor but in merriment a quarrel.</l>
            <l>O may she live like some green laurel</l>
            <l>Rooted in one dear perpetual place.</l>
            <l>My mind, because the minds that I have loved,</l>
            <l>The sort of beauty that I have approved,</l>
            <l>Prosper but little, has dried up of late,</l>
            <l>Yet knows that to be choked with hate</l>
            <l>May well be of all evil chances chief.</l>
            <l>If there's no hatred in a mind</l>
            <l>Assault and battery of the wind</l>
            <l>Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.</l>
            <l>An intellectual hatred is the worst,</l>
            <l>So let her think opinions are accursed.</l>
            <l>Have I not seen the loveliest woman born</l>
            <l>Out of the mouth of plenty's horn,</l>
            <l>Because of her opinionated mind</l>
            <l>Barter that horn and every good</l>
            <l>By quiet natures understood</l>
            <l>For an old bellows full of angry wind?</l>
            <l>Considering that, all hatred driven hence,</l>
            <l>The soul recovers radical innocence</l>
            <l>And learns at last that it is self-delighting,</l>
            <l>Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,</l>
            <l>And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;</l>
            <l>She can, though every face should scowl</l>
            <l>And every windy quarter howl</l>
            <l>Or every bellows burst, be happy Still.</l>
            <l>And may her bridegroom bring her to a house</l>
            <l>Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;</l>
            <l>For arrogance and hatred are the wares</l>
            <l>Peddled in the thoroughfares.</l>
            <l>How but in custom and in ceremony</l>
            <l>Are innocence and beauty born?</l>
            <l>Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,</l>
            <l>And custom for the spreading laurel tree.</l>
            <l>A MEDITATION IN TIME OF WAR</l>
            <l>FOR one throb of the artery,</l>
            <l>While on that old grey stone I Sat</l>
            <l>Under the old wind-broken tree,</l>
            <l>I knew that One is animate,</l>
            <l>Mankind inanimate fantasy'.</l>
            <l>TO BE CARVED ON A STONE AT THOOR BALLYLEE</l>
            <l>I, THE poet William Yeats,</l>
            <l>With old mill boards and sea-green slates,</l>
            <l>And smithy work from the Gort forge,</l>
            <l>Restored this tower for my wife George;</l>

               <l>   I</l>
               <l>THAT is no country for old men. The young</l>
               <l>In one another's arms, birds in the trees</l>
               <l> — Those dying generations — at their song,</l>
               <l>The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,</l>
               <l>Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long</l>
               <l>Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.</l>
               <l>Caught in that sensual music all neglect</l>
               <l>Monuments of unageing intellect.</l>
               <l>An aged man is but a paltry thing,</l>
               <l>A tattered coat upon a stick, unless</l>
               <l>Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing</l>
               <l>For every tatter in its mortal dress,</l>
               <l>Nor is there singing school but studying</l>
               <l>Monuments of its own magnificence;</l>
               <l>And therefore I have sailed the seas and come</l>
               <l>To the holy city of Byzantium.</l>
               <l>O sages standing in God's holy fire</l>
               <l>As in the gold mosaic of a wall,</l>
               <l>Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,</l>
               <l>And be the singing-masters of my soul.</l>
               <l>Consume my heart away; sick with desire</l>
               <l>And fastened to a dying animal</l>
               <l>It knows not what it is; and gather me</l>
               <l>Into the artifice of eternity.</l>
               <l>Once out Of nature I shall never take</l>
               <l>My bodily form from any natural thing,</l>
               <l>But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make</l>
               <l>Of hammered gold and gold enamelling</l>
               <l>To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;</l>
               <l>Or set upon a golden bough to sing</l>
               <l>To lords and ladies of Byzantium</l>
               <l>Of what is past, or passing, or to come.</l>
               <l>THE TOWER</l>
               <l>   I</l>
               <l>WHAT shall I do with this absurdity — </l>
               <l>O heart, O troubled heart — this caricature,</l>
               <l>Decrepit age that has been tied to me</l>
               <l>As to a dog's tail?</l>
               <l>Never had I more</l>
               <l>Excited, passionate, fantastical</l>
               <l>Imagination, nor an ear and eye</l>
               <l>That more expected the impossible — </l>
               <l>No, not in boyhood when with rod and fly,</l>
               <l>Or the humbler worm, I climbed Ben Bulben's back</l>
               <l>And had the livelong summer day to spend.</l>
               <l>It seems that I must bid the Muse go pack,</l>
               <l>Choose Plato and Plotinus for a friend</l>
               <l>Until imagination, ear and eye,</l>
               <l>Can be content with argument and deal</l>
               <l>In abstract things; or be derided by</l>
               <l>A sort of battered kettle at the heel.</l>
               <l>I pace upon the battlements and stare</l>
               <l>On the foundations of a house, or where</l>
               <l>Tree, like a sooty finger, starts from the earth;</l>
               <l>And send imagination forth</l>
               <l>Under the day's declining beam, and call</l>
               <l>Images and memories</l>
               <l>From ruin or from ancient trees,</l>
               <l>For I would ask a question of them all.</l>
               <l>Beyond that ridge lived Mrs. French, and once</l>
               <l>When every silver candlestick or sconce</l>
               <l>Lit up the dark mahogany and the wine.</l>
               <l>A serving-man, that could divine</l>
               <l>That most respected lady's every wish,</l>
               <l>Ran and with the garden shears</l>
               <l>Clipped an insolent farmer's ears</l>
               <l>And brought them in a little covered dish.</l>
               <l>Some few remembered still when I was young</l>
               <l>A peasant girl commended by a Song,</l>
               <l>Who'd lived somewhere upon that rocky place,</l>
               <l>And praised the colour of her face,</l>
               <l>And had the greater joy in praising her,</l>
               <l>Remembering that, if walked she there,</l>
               <l>Farmers jostled at the fair</l>
               <l>So great a glory did the song confer.</l>
               <l>And certain men, being maddened by those rhymes,</l>
               <l>Or else by toasting her a score of times,</l>
               <l>Rose from the table and declared it right</l>
               <l>To test their fancy by their sight;</l>
               <l>But they mistook the brightness of the moon</l>
               <l>For the prosaic light of day — </l>
               <l>Music had driven their wits astray — </l>
               <l>And one was drowned in the great bog of Cloone.</l>
               <l>Strange, but the man who made the song was blind;</l>
               <l>Yet, now I have considered it, I find</l>
               <l>That nothing strange; the tragedy began</l>
               <l>With Homer that was a blind man,</l>
               <l>And Helen has all living hearts betrayed.</l>
               <l>O may the moon and sunlight seem</l>
               <l>One inextricable beam,</l>
               <l>For if I triumph I must make men mad.</l>
               <l>And I myself created Hanrahan</l>
               <l>And drove him drunk or sober through the dawn</l>
               <l>From somewhere in the neighbouring cottages.</l>
               <l>Caught by an old man's juggleries</l>
               <l>He stumbled, tumbled, fumbled to and fro</l>
               <l>And had but broken knees for hire</l>
               <l>And horrible splendour of desire;</l>
               <l>I thought it all out twenty years ago:</l>
               <l>Good fellows shuffled cards in an old bawn;</l>
               <l>And when that ancient ruffian's turn was on</l>
               <l>He so bewitched the cards under his thumb</l>
               <l>That all but the one card became</l>
               <l>A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards,</l>
               <l>And that he changed into a hare.</l>
               <l>Hanrahan rose in frenzy there</l>
               <l>And followed up those baying creatures towards — </l>
               <l>O towards I have forgotten what — enough!</l>
               <l>I must recall a man that neither love</l>
               <l>Nor music nor an enemy's clipped ear</l>
               <l>Could, he was so harried, cheer;</l>
               <l>A figure that has grown so fabulous</l>
               <l>There's not a neighbour left to say</l>
               <l>When he finished his dog's day:</l>
               <l>An ancient bankrupt master of this house.</l>
               <l>Before that ruin came, for centuries,</l>
               <l>Rough men-at-arms, cross-gartered to the knees</l>
               <l>Or shod in iron, climbed the narrow stairs,</l>
               <l>And certain men-at-arms there were</l>
               <l>Whose images, in the Great Memory stored,</l>
               <l>Come with loud cry and panting breast</l>
               <l>To break upon a sleeper's rest</l>
               <l>While their great wooden dice beat on the board.</l>
               <l>As I would question all, come all who can;</l>
               <l>Come old, necessitous. half-mounted man;</l>
               <l>And bring beauty's blind rambling celebrant;</l>
               <l>The red man the juggler sent</l>
               <l>Through God-forsaken meadows; Mrs. French,</l>
               <l>Gifted with so fine an ear;</l>
               <l>The man drowned in a bog's mire,</l>
               <l>When mocking Muses chose the country wench.</l>
               <l>Did all old men and women, rich and poor,</l>
               <l>Who trod upon these rocks or passed this door,</l>
               <l>Whether in public or in secret rage</l>
               <l>As I do now against old age?</l>
               <l>But I have found an answer in those eyes</l>
               <l>That are impatient to be gone;</l>
               <l>Go therefore; but leave Hanrahan,</l>
               <l>For I need all his mighty memories.</l>
               <l>Old lecher with a love on every wind,</l>
               <l>Bring up out of that deep considering mind</l>
               <l>All that you have discovered in the grave,</l>
               <l>For it is certain that you have</l>
               <l>Reckoned up every unforeknown, unseeing</l>
               <l>plunge, lured by a softening eye,</l>
               <l>Or by a touch or a sigh,</l>
               <l>Into the labyrinth of another's being;</l>
               <l>Does the imagination dwell the most</l>
               <l>Upon a woman won or woman lost.?</l>
               <l>If on the lost, admit you turned aside</l>
               <l>From a great labyrinth out of pride,</l>
               <l>Cowardice, some silly over-subtle thought</l>
               <l>Or anything called conscience once;</l>
               <l>And that if memory recur, the sun's</l>
               <l>Under eclipse and the day blotted out.</l>
               <l>   III</l>
               <l>It is time that I wrote my will;</l>
               <l>I choose upstanding men</l>
               <l>That climb the streams until</l>
               <l>The fountain leap, and at dawn</l>
               <l>Drop their cast at the side</l>
               <l>Of dripping stone; I declare</l>
               <l>They shall inherit my pride,</l>
               <l>The pride of people that were</l>
               <l>Bound neither to Cause nor to State.</l>
               <l>Neither to slaves that were spat on,</l>
               <l>Nor to the tyrants that spat,</l>
               <l>The people of Burke and of Grattan</l>
               <l>That gave, though free to refuse — </l>
               <l>pride, like that of the morn,</l>
               <l>When the headlong light is loose,</l>
               <l>Or that of the fabulous horn,</l>
               <l>Or that of the sudden shower</l>
               <l>When all streams are dry,</l>
               <l>Or that of the hour</l>
               <l>When the swan must fix his eye</l>
               <l>Upon a fading gleam,</l>
               <l>Float out upon a long</l>
               <l>Last reach of glittering stream</l>
               <l>And there sing his last song.</l>
               <l>And I declare my faith:</l>
               <l>I mock plotinus' thought</l>
               <l>And cry in plato's teeth,</l>
               <l>Death and life were not</l>
               <l>Till man made up the whole,</l>
               <l>Made lock, stock and barrel</l>
               <l>Out of his bitter soul,</l>
               <l>Aye, sun and moon and star, all,</l>
               <l>And further add to that</l>
               <l>That, being dead, we rise,</l>
               <l>Dream and so create</l>
               <l>Translunar paradise.</l>
               <l>I have prepared my peace</l>
               <l>With learned Italian things</l>
               <l>And the proud stones of Greece,</l>
               <l>Poet's imaginings</l>
               <l>And memories of love,</l>
               <l>Memories of the words of women,</l>
               <l>All those things whereof</l>
               <l>Man makes a superhuman,</l>
               <l>Mirror-resembling dream.</l>
               <l>As at the loophole there</l>
               <l>The daws chatter and scream,</l>
               <l>And drop twigs layer upon layer.</l>
               <l>When they have mounted up,</l>
               <l>The mother bird will rest</l>
               <l>On their hollow top,</l>
               <l>And so warm her wild nest.</l>
               <l>I leave both faith and pride</l>
               <l>To young upstanding men</l>
               <l>Climbing the mountain-side,</l>
               <l>That under bursting dawn</l>
               <l>They may drop a fly;</l>
               <l>Being of that metal made</l>
               <l>Till it was broken by</l>
               <l>This sedentary trade.</l>
               <l>Now shall I make my soul,</l>
               <l>Compelling it to study</l>
               <l>In a learned school</l>
               <l>Till the wreck of body,</l>
               <l>Slow decay of blood,</l>
               <l>Testy delirium</l>
               <l>Or dull decrepitude,</l>
               <l>Or what worse evil come — </l>
               <l>The death of friends, or death</l>
               <l>Of every brilliant eye</l>
               <l>That made a catch in the breath — .</l>
               <l>Seem but the clouds of the sky</l>
               <l>When the horizon fades;</l>
               <l>Or a bird's sleepy cry</l>
               <l>Among the deepening shades.</l>
               <l>MEDITATIONS IN TIME OF CIVIL WAR</l>
               <l>   I</l>
               <l>Ancestral Houses</l>
               <l>SURELY among a rich man s flowering lawns,</l>
               <l>Amid the rustle of his planted hills,</l>
               <l>Life overflows without ambitious pains;</l>
               <l>And rains down life until the basin spills,</l>
               <l>And mounts more dizzy high the more it rains</l>
               <l>As though to choose whatever shape it wills</l>
               <l>And never stoop to a mechanical</l>
               <l>Or servile shape, at others' beck and call.</l>
               <l>Mere dreams, mere dreams! Yet Homer had not Sung</l>
               <l>Had he not found it certain beyond dreams</l>
               <l>That out of life's own self-delight had sprung</l>
               <l>The abounding glittering jet; though now it seems</l>
               <l>As if some marvellous empty sea-shell flung</l>
               <l>Out of the obscure dark of the rich streams,</l>
               <l>And not a fountain, were the symbol which</l>
               <l>Shadows the inherited glory of the rich.</l>
               <l>Some violent bitter man, some powerful man</l>
               <l>Called architect and artist in, that they,</l>
               <l>Bitter and violent men, might rear in stone</l>
               <l>The sweetness that all longed for night and day,</l>
               <l>The gentleness none there had ever known;</l>
               <l>But when the master's buried mice can play.</l>
               <l>And maybe the great-grandson of that house,</l>
               <l>For all its bronze and marble, 's but a mouse.</l>
               <l>O what if gardens where the peacock strays</l>
               <l>With delicate feet upon old terraces,</l>
               <l>Or else all Juno from an urn displays</l>
               <l>Before the indifferent garden deities;</l>
               <l>O what if levelled lawns and gravelled ways</l>
               <l>Where slippered Contemplation finds his ease</l>
               <l>And Childhood a delight for every sense,</l>
               <l>But take our greatness with our violence?</l>
               <l>What if the glory of escutcheoned doors,</l>
               <l>And buildings that a haughtier age designed,</l>
               <l>The pacing to and fro on polished floors</l>
               <l>Amid great chambers and long galleries, lined</l>
               <l>With famous portraits of our ancestors;</l>
               <l>What if those things the greatest of mankind</l>
               <l>Consider most to magnify, or to bless,</l>

               <l>My House</l>
               <l>An ancient bridge, and a more ancient tower,</l>
               <l>A farmhouse that is sheltered by its wall,</l>
               <l>An acre of stony ground,</l>
               <l>Where the symbolic rose can break in flower,</l>
               <l>Old ragged elms, old thorns innumerable,</l>
               <l>The sound of the rain or sound</l>
               <l>Of every wind that blows;</l>
               <l>The stilted water-hen</l>
               <l>Crossing Stream again</l>
               <l>Scared by the splashing of a dozen cows;</l>
               <l>A winding stair, a chamber arched with stone,</l>
               <l>A grey stone fireplace with an open hearth,</l>
               <l>A candle and written page.</l>
               <l>Il Penseroso's Platonist toiled on</l>
               <l>In some like chamber, shadowing forth</l>
               <l>How the daemonic rage</l>
               <l>Imagined everything.</l>
               <l>Benighted travellers</l>
               <l>From markets and from fairs</l>
               <l>Have seen his midnight candle glimmering.</l>
               <l>Two men have founded here. A man-at-arms</l>
               <l>Gathered a score of horse and spent his days</l>
               <l>In this tumultuous spot,</l>
               <l>Where through long wars and sudden night alarms</l>
               <l>His dwindling score and he seemed castaways</l>
               <l>Forgetting and forgot;</l>
               <l>And I, that after me</l>
               <l>My bodily heirs may find,</l>
               <l>To exalt a lonely mind,</l>
               <l>Befitting emblems of adversity.</l>
               <l>   III</l>
               <l>My Table</l>
               <l>Two heavy trestles, and a board</l>
               <l>Where Sato's gift, a changeless sword,</l>
               <l>By pen and paper lies,</l>
               <l>That it may moralise</l>
               <l>My days out of their aimlessness.</l>
               <l>A bit of an embroidered dress</l>
               <l>Covers its wooden sheath.</l>
               <l>Chaucer had not drawn breath</l>
               <l>When it was forged. In Sato's house,</l>
               <l>Curved like new moon, moon-luminous</l>
               <l>It lay five hundred years.</l>
               <l>Yet if no change appears</l>
               <l>No moon; only an aching heart</l>
               <l>Conceives a changeless work of art.</l>
               <l>Our learned men have urged</l>
               <l>That when and where 'twas forged</l>
               <l>A marvellous accomplishment,</l>
               <l>In painting or in pottery, went</l>
               <l>From father unto son</l>
               <l>And through the centuries ran</l>
               <l>And seemed unchanging like the sword.</l>
               <l>Soul's beauty being most adored,</l>
               <l>Men and their business took</l>
               <l>Me soul's unchanging look;</l>
               <l>For the most rich inheritor,</l>
               <l>Knowing that none could pass Heaven's door,</l>
               <l>That loved inferior art,</l>
               <l>Had such an aching heart</l>
               <l>That he, although a country's talk</l>
               <l>For silken clothes and stately walk.</l>
               <l>Had waking wits; it seemed</l>
               <l>Juno's peacock screamed.</l>
               <l>   IV</l>
               <l>My Descendants</l>
               <l>Having inherited a vigorous mind</l>
               <l>From my old fathers, I must nourish dreams</l>
               <l>And leave a woman and a man behind</l>
               <l>As vigorous of mind, and yet it seems</l>
               <l>Life scarce can cast a fragrance on the wind,</l>
               <l>Scarce spread a glory to the morning beams,</l>
               <l>But the torn petals strew the garden plot;</l>
               <l>And there's but common greenness after that.</l>
               <l>And what if my descendants lose the flower</l>
               <l>Through natural declension of the soul,</l>
               <l>Through too much business with the passing hour,</l>
               <l>Through too much play, or marriage with a fool?</l>
               <l>May this laborious stair and this stark tower</l>
               <l>Become a roofless min that the owl</l>
               <l>May build in the cracked masonry and cry</l>
               <l>Her desolation to the desolate sky.</l>
               <l>The Primum Mobile that fashioned us</l>
               <l>Has made the very owls in circles move;</l>
               <l>And I, that count myself most prosperous,</l>
               <l>Seeing that love and friendship are enough,</l>
               <l>For an old neighbour's friendship chose the house</l>
               <l>And decked and altered it for a girl's love,</l>
               <l>And know whatever flourish and decline</l>
               <l>These stones remain their monument and mine.</l>
               <l>   V</l>
               <l>The Road at My Door</l>
               <l>An affable Irregular,</l>
               <l>A heavily-built Falstaffian man,</l>
               <l>Comes cracking jokes of civil war</l>
               <l>As though to die by gunshot were</l>
               <l>The finest play under the sun.</l>
               <l>A brown Lieutenant and his men,</l>
               <l>Half dressed in national uniform,</l>
               <l>Stand at my door, and I complain</l>
               <l>Of the foul weather, hail and rain,</l>
               <l>A pear-tree broken by the storm.</l>
               <l>I count those feathered balls of soot</l>
               <l>The moor-hen guides upon the stream.</l>
               <l>To silence the envy in my thought;</l>
               <l>And turn towards my chamber, caught</l>
               <l>In the cold snows of a dream.</l>
               <l>   VI</l>
               <l>The Stare's Nest by My Window</l>
               <l>The bees build in the crevices</l>
               <l>Of loosening masonry, and there</l>
               <l>The mother birds bring grubs and flies.</l>
               <l>My wall is loosening; honey-bees,</l>
               <l>Come build in the empty house of the state.</l>
               <l>We are closed in, and the key is turned</l>
               <l>On our uncertainty; somewhere</l>
               <l>A man is killed, or a house burned,</l>
               <l>Yet no cleat fact to be discerned:</l>
               <l>Come build in he empty house of the stare.</l>
               <l>A barricade of stone or of wood;</l>
               <l>Some fourteen days of civil war;</l>
               <l>Last night they trundled down the road</l>
               <l>That dead young soldier in his blood:</l>
               <l>Come build in the empty house of the stare.</l>
               <l>We had fed the heart on fantasies,</l>
               <l>The heart's grown brutal from the fare;</l>
               <l>More Substance in our enmities</l>
               <l>Than in our love; O honey-bees,</l>
               <l>Come build in the empty house of the stare.</l>
               <l>   VII</l>
               <l>I see Phantoms of Hatred and of the Heart's</l>
               <l>Fullness and of the Coming Emptiness</l>
               <l>I climb to the tower-top and lean upon broken stone,</l>
               <l>A mist that is like blown snow is sweeping over all,</l>
               <l>Valley, river, and elms, under the light of a moon</l>
               <l>That seems unlike itself, that seems unchangeable,</l>
               <l>A glittering sword out of the east. A puff of wind</l>
               <l>And those white glimmering fragments of the mist</l>
               <l>sweep by.</l>
               <l>Frenzies bewilder, reveries perturb the mind;</l>
               <l>Monstrous familiar images swim to the mind's eye.</l>
               <l>`Vengeance upon the murderers,' the cry goes up,</l>
               <l>`Vengeance for Jacques Molay.' In cloud-pale rags, or</l>
               <l>in lace,</l>
               <l>The rage-driven, rage-tormented, and rage-hungry troop,</l>
               <l>Trooper belabouring trooper, biting at arm or at face,</l>
               <l>Plunges towards nothing, arms and fingers spreading</l>
               <l>wide</l>
               <l>For the embrace of nothing; and I, my wits astray</l>
               <l>Because of all that senseless tumult, all but cried</l>
               <l>For vengeance on the murderers of Jacques Molay.</l>
               <l>Their legs long, delicate and slender, aquamarine their</l>
               <l>eyes,</l>
               <l>Magical unicorns bear ladies on their backs.</l>
               <l>The ladies close their musing eyes. No prophecies,</l>
               <l>Remembered out of Babylonian almanacs,</l>
               <l>Have closed the ladies' eyes, their minds are but a pool</l>
               <l>Where even longing drowns under its own excess;</l>
               <l>Nothing but stillness can remain when hearts are full</l>
               <l>Of their own sweetness, bodies of their loveliness.</l>
               <l>The cloud-pale unicorns, the eyes of aquamarine,</l>
               <l>The quivering half-closed eyelids, the rags of cloud or</l>
               <l>of lace,</l>
               <l>Or eyes that rage has brightened, arms it has made lean,</l>
               <l>Give place to an indifferent multitude, give place</l>
               <l>To brazen hawks. Nor self-delighting reverie,</l>
               <l>Nor hate of what's to come, nor pity for what's gone,</l>
               <l>Nothing but grip of claw, and the eye's complacency,</l>
               <l>The innumerable clanging wings that have put out the</l>
               <l>moon.</l>
               <l>I turn away and shut the door, and on the stair</l>
               <l>Wonder how many times I could have proved my</l>
               <l>worth</l>
               <l>In something that all others understand or share;</l>
               <l>But O! ambitious heart, had such a proof drawn forth</l>
               <l>A company of friends, a conscience set at ease,</l>
               <l>It had but made us pine the more. The abstract joy,</l>
               <l>The half-read wisdom of daemonic images,</l>
               <l>Suffice the ageing man as once the growing boy.</l>
               <l>NINETEEN HUNDRED AND NINETEEN</l>
               <l>MANY ingenious lovely things are gone</l>
               <l>That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude,</l>
               <l>protected from the circle of the moon</l>
               <l>That pitches common things about. There stood</l>
               <l>Amid the ornamental bronze and stone</l>
               <l>An ancient image made of olive wood — </l>
               <l>And gone are Phidias' famous ivories</l>
               <l>And all the golden grasshoppers and bees.</l>
               <l>We too had many pretty toys when young:</l>
               <l>A law indifferent to blame or praise,</l>
               <l>To bribe or threat; habits that made old wrong</l>
               <l>Melt down, as it were wax in the sun's rays;</l>
               <l>Public opinion ripening for so long</l>
               <l>We thought it would outlive all future days.</l>
               <l>O what fine thought we had because we thought</l>
               <l>That the worst rogues and rascals had died out.</l>
               <l>All teeth were drawn, all ancient tricks unlearned,</l>
               <l>And a great army but a showy thing;</l>
               <l>What matter that no cannon had been turned</l>
               <l>Into a ploughshare? Parliament and king</l>
               <l>Thought that unless a little powder burned</l>
               <l>The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting</l>
               <l>And yet it lack all glory; and perchance</l>
               <l>The guardsmen's drowsy chargers would not prance.</l>
               <l>Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare</l>
               <l>Rides upon sleep: a drunken soldiery</l>
               <l>Can leave the mother, murdered at her door,</l>
               <l>To crawl in her own blood, and go scot-free;</l>
               <l>The night can sweat with terror as before</l>
               <l>We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,</l>
               <l>And planned to bring the world under a rule,</l>
               <l>Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.</l>
               <l>He who can read the signs nor sink unmanned</l>
               <l>Into the half-deceit of some intoxicant</l>
               <l>From shallow wits; who knows no work can stand,</l>
               <l>Whether health, wealth or peace of mind were spent</l>
               <l>On master-work of intellect or hand,</l>
               <l>No honour leave its mighty monument,</l>
               <l>Has but one comfort left: all triumph would</l>
               <l>But break upon his ghostly solitude.</l>
               <l>But is there any comfort to be found?</l>
               <l>Man is in love and loves what vanishes,</l>
               <l>What more is there to say? That country round</l>
               <l>None dared admit, if Such a thought were his,</l>
               <l>Incendiary or bigot could be found</l>
               <l>To burn that stump on the Acropolis,</l>
               <l>Or break in bits the famous ivories</l>
               <l>Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees.</l>
               <l>When Loie Fuller's Chinese dancers enwound</l>
               <l>A shining web, a floating ribbon of cloth,</l>
               <l>It seemed that a dragon of air</l>
               <l>Had fallen among dancers, had whirled them round</l>
               <l>Or hurried them off on its own furious path;</l>
               <l>So the platonic Year</l>
               <l>Whirls out new right and wrong,</l>
               <l>Whirls in the old instead;</l>
               <l>All men are dancers and their tread</l>
               <l>Goes to the barbarous clangour of a gong.</l>
               <l>   III</l>
               <l>Some moralist or mythological poet</l>
               <l>Compares the solitary soul to a swan;</l>
               <l>I am satisfied with that,</l>
               <l>Satisfied if a troubled mirror show it,</l>
               <l>Before that brief gleam of its life be gone,</l>
               <l>An image of its state;</l>
               <l>The wings half spread for flight,</l>
               <l>The breast thrust out in pride</l>
               <l>Whether to play, or to ride</l>
               <l>Those winds that clamour of approaching night.</l>
               <l>A man in his own secret meditation</l>
               <l>Is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made</l>
               <l>In art or politics;</l>
               <l>Some platonist affirms that in the station</l>
               <l>Where we should cast off body and trade</l>
               <l>The ancient habit sticks,</l>
               <l>And that if our works could</l>
               <l>But vanish with our breath</l>
               <l>That were a lucky death,</l>
               <l>For triumph can but mar our solitude.</l>
               <l>The swan has leaped into the desolate heaven:</l>
               <l>That image can bring wildness, bring a rage</l>
               <l>To end all things, to end</l>
               <l>What my laborious life imagined, even</l>
               <l>The half-imagined, the half-written page;</l>
               <l>O but we dreamed to mend</l>
               <l>Whatever mischief seemed</l>
               <l>To afflict mankind, but now</l>
               <l>That winds of winter blow</l>
               <l>Learn that we were crack-pated when we dreamed.</l>
               <l>We, who seven years ago</l>
               <l>Talked of honour and of truth,</l>
               <l>Shriek with pleasure if we show</l>
               <l>The weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth.</l>
               <l>Come let us mock at the great</l>
               <l>That had such burdens on the mind</l>
               <l>And toiled so hard and late</l>
               <l>To leave some monument behind,</l>
               <l>Nor thought of the levelling wind.</l>
               <l>Come let us mock at the wise;</l>
               <l>With all those calendars whereon</l>
               <l>They fixed old aching eyes,</l>
               <l>They never saw how seasons run,</l>
               <l>And now but gape at the sun.</l>
               <l>Come let us mock at the good</l>
               <l>That fancied goodness might be gay,</l>
               <l>And sick of solitude</l>
               <l>Might proclaim a holiday:</l>
               <l>Wind shrieked — and where are they?</l>
               <l>Mock mockers after that</l>
               <l>That would not lift a hand maybe</l>
               <l>To help good, wise or great</l>
               <l>To bar that foul storm out, for we</l>
               <l>Traffic in mockery.</l>
               <l>Violence upon the roads: violence of horses;</l>
               <l>Some few have handsome riders, are garlanded</l>
               <l>On delicate sensitive ear or tossing mane,</l>
               <l>But wearied running round and round in their courses</l>
               <l>All break and vanish, and evil gathers head:</l>
               <l>Herodias' daughters have returned again,</l>
               <l>A sudden blast of dusty wind and after</l>
               <l>Thunder of feet, tumult of images,</l>
               <l>Their purpose in the labyrinth of the wind;</l>
               <l>And should some crazy hand dare touch a daughter</l>
               <l>All turn with amorous cries, or angry cries,</l>
               <l>According to the wind, for all are blind.</l>
               <l>But now wind drops, dust settles; thereupon</l>
               <l>There lurches past, his great eyes without thought</l>
               <l>Under the shadow of stupid straw-pale locks,</l>
               <l>That insolent fiend Robert Artisson</l>
               <l>To whom the love-lorn Lady Kyteler brought</l>
               <l>Bronzed peacock feathers, red combs of her cocks.</l>
               <l>THE WHEEL</l>
               <l>THROUGH winter-time we call on spring,</l>
               <l>And through the spring on summer call,</l>
               <l>And when abounding hedges ring</l>
               <l>Declare that winter's best of all;</l>
               <l>And after that there s nothing good</l>
               <l>Because the spring-time has not come — </l>
               <l>Nor know that what disturbs our blood</l>
               <l>Is but its longing for the tomb.</l>
               <l>YOUTH AND AGE</l>
               <l>MUCH did I rage when young,</l>
               <l>Being by the world oppressed,</l>
               <l>But now with flattering tongue</l>
               <l>It speeds the parting guest.</l>
               <l>THE NEW FACES</l>
               <l>IF you, that have grown old, were the first dead,</l>
               <l>Neither catalpa tree nor scented lime</l>
               <l>Should hear my living feet, nor would I tread</l>
               <l>Where we wrought that shall break the teeth of Time.</l>
               <l>Let the new faces play what tricks they will</l>
               <l>In the old rooms; night can outbalance day,</l>
               <l>Our shadows rove the garden gravel still,</l>
               <l>The living seem more shadowy than they.</l>
               <l>A PRAYER FOR MY SON</l>
               <l>BID a strong ghost stand at the head</l>
               <l>That my Michael may sleep sound,</l>
               <l>Nor cry, nor turn in the bed</l>
               <l>Till his morning meal come round;</l>
               <l>And may departing twilight keep</l>
               <l>All dread afar till morning's back.</l>
               <l>That his mother may not lack</l>
               <l>Her fill of sleep.</l>
               <l>Bid the ghost have sword in fist:</l>
               <l>Some there are, for I avow</l>
               <l>Such devilish things exist,</l>
               <l>Who have planned his murder, for they know</l>
               <l>Of some most haughty deed or thought</l>
               <l>That waits upon his future days,</l>
               <l>And would through hatred of the bays</l>
               <l>Bring that to nought.</l>
               <l>Though You can fashion everything</l>
               <l>From nothing every day, and teach</l>
               <l>The morning stats to sing,</l>
               <l>You have lacked articulate speech</l>
               <l>To tell Your simplest want, and known,</l>
               <l>Wailing upon a woman's knee,</l>
               <l>All of that worst ignominy</l>
               <l>Of flesh and bone;</l>
               <l>And when through all the town there ran</l>
               <l>The servants of Your enemy,</l>
               <l>A woman and a man,</l>
               <l>Unless the Holy Writings lie,</l>
               <l>Hurried through the smooth and rough</l>
               <l>And through the fertile and waste,</l>
               <l>protecting, till the danger past,</l>
               <l>With human love.</l>
               <l>TWO SONGS FROM A PLAY</l>
               <l>   I</l>
               <l>I SAW a staring virgin stand</l>
               <l>Where holy Dionysus died,</l>
               <l>And tear the heart out of his side.</l>
               <l>And lay the heart upon her hand</l>
               <l>And bear that beating heart away;</l>
               <l>Of Magnus Annus at the spring,</l>
               <l>As though God's death were but a play.</l>
               <l>Another Troy must rise and set,</l>
               <l>Another lineage feed the crow,</l>
               <l>Another Argo's painted prow</l>
               <l>Drive to a flashier bauble yet.</l>
               <l>The Roman Empire stood appalled:</l>
               <l>It dropped the reins of peace and war</l>
               <l>When that fierce virgin and her Star</l>
               <l>Out of the fabulous darkness called.</l>
               <l>In pity for man's darkening thought</l>
               <l>He walked that room and issued thence</l>
               <l>In Galilean turbulence;</l>
               <l>The Babylonian starlight brought</l>
               <l>A fabulous, formless darkness in;</l>
               <l>Odour of blood when Christ was slain</l>
               <l>Made all platonic tolerance vain</l>
               <l>And vain all Doric discipline.</l>
               <l>Everything that man esteems</l>
               <l>Endures a moment or a day.</l>
               <l>Love's pleasure drives his love away,</l>
               <l>The painter's brush consumes his dreams;</l>
               <l>The herald's cry, the soldier's tread</l>
               <l>Exhaust his glory and his might:</l>
               <l>Whatever flames upon the night</l>
               <l>Man's own resinous heart has fed.</l>
               <l>FRAGMENTS</l>
               <l>   I</l>
               <l>LOCKE sank into a swoon;</l>
               <l>The Garden died;</l>
               <l>God took the spinning-jenny</l>
               <l>Out of his side.</l>
               <l>   II</l>
               <l>Where got I that truth?</l>
               <l>Out of a medium's mouth.</l>
               <l>Out of nothing it came,</l>
               <l>Out of the forest loam,</l>
               <l>Out of dark night where lay</l>
               <l>The crowns of Nineveh.</l>
               <l>LEDA AND THE SWAN</l>
               <l>A SUDDEN blow: the great wings beating still</l>
               <l>Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed</l>
               <l>By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,</l>
               <l>He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.</l>
               <l>How can those terrified vague fingers push</l>
               <l>The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?</l>
               <l>And how can body, laid in that white rush,</l>
               <l>But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?</l>
               <l>A shudder in the loins engenders there</l>
               <l>The broken wall, the burning roof and tower</l>
               <l>And Agamemnon dead.</l>
               <l>Being so caught up,</l>
               <l>So mastered by the brute blood of the air,</l>
               <l>Did she put on his knowledge with his power</l>
               <l>Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?</l>
               <l>ON A PICTURE OF A BLACK CENTAUR BY</l>
               <l>EDMUND DULAC</l>
               <l>YOUR hooves have stamped at the black margin of the</l>
               <l>wood,</l>
               <l>Even where horrible green parrots call and swing.</l>
               <l>My works are all stamped down into the sultry mud.</l>
               <l>I knew that horse-play, knew it for a murderous thing.</l>
               <l>What wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food</l>
               <l>to eat,</l>
               <l>And that alone; yet I, being driven half insane</l>
               <l>Because of some green wing, gathered old mummy</l>
               <l>wheat</l>
               <l>In the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain</l>
               <l>And after baked it slowly in an oven; but now</l>
               <l>I bring full-flavoured wine out of a barrel found</l>
               <l>Where seven Ephesian topers slept and never knew</l>
               <l>When Alexander's empire passed, they slept so sound.</l>
               <l>Stretch out your limbs and sleep a long Saturnian sleep;</l>
               <l>I have loved you better than my soul for all my words,</l>
               <l>And there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep</l>
               <l>Unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds.</l>
               <l>AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN</l>
               <l>I WALK through the long schoolroom questioning;</l>
               <l>A kind old nun in a white hood replies;</l>
               <l>The children learn to cipher and to sing,</l>
               <l>To study reading-books and histories,</l>
               <l>To cut and sew, be neat in everything</l>
               <l>In the best modern way — the children's eyes</l>
               <l>In momentary wonder stare upon</l>
               <l>A sixty-year-old smiling public man.</l>
               <l>I dream of a Ledaean body, bent</l>
               <l>Above a sinking fire. a tale that she</l>
               <l>Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event</l>
               <l>That changed some childish day to tragedy — </l>
               <l>Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent</l>
               <l>Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,</l>
               <l>Or else, to alter Plato's parable,</l>
               <l>Into the yolk and white of the one shell.</l>
               <l>   III</l>
               <l>And thinking of that fit of grief or rage</l>
               <l>I look upon one child or t'other there</l>
               <l>And wonder if she stood so at that age — </l>
               <l>For even daughters of the swan can share</l>
               <l>Something of every paddler's heritage — </l>
               <l>And had that colour upon cheek or hair,</l>
               <l>And thereupon my heart is driven wild:</l>
               <l>She stands before me as a living child.</l>
               <l>Her present image floats into the mind — </l>
               <l>Did Quattrocento finger fashion it</l>
               <l>Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind</l>
               <l>And took a mess of shadows for its meat?</l>
               <l>And I though never of Ledaean kind</l>
               <l>Had pretty plumage once — enough of that,</l>
               <l>Better to smile on all that smile, and show</l>
               <l>There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.</l>
               <l>What youthful mother, a shape upon her lap</l>
               <l>Honey of generation had betrayed,</l>
               <l>And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape</l>
               <l>As recollection or the drug decide,</l>
               <l>Would think her Son, did she but see that shape</l>
               <l>With sixty or more winters on its head,</l>
               <l>A compensation for the pang of his birth,</l>
               <l>Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?</l>
               <l>Plato thought nature but a spume that plays</l>
               <l>Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;</l>
               <l>Solider Aristotle played the taws</l>
               <l>Upon the bottom of a king of kings;</l>
               <l>World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras</l>
               <l>Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings</l>
               <l>What a star sang and careless Muses heard:</l>
               <l>Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.</l>
               <l>   VII</l>
               <l>Both nuns and mothers worship images,</l>
               <l>But those the candles light are not as those</l>
               <l>That animate a mother's reveries,</l>
               <l>But keep a marble or a bronze repose.</l>
               <l>And yet they too break hearts — O presences</l>
               <l>That passion, piety or affection knows,</l>
               <l>And that all heavenly glory symbolise — </l>
               <l>O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;</l>
               <l>   VIII</l>
               <l>Labour is blossoming or dancing where</l>
               <l>The body is not bruised to pleasure soul.</l>
               <l>Nor beauty born out of its own despair,</l>
               <l>Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.</l>
               <l>O chestnut-tree, great-rooted blossomer,</l>
               <l>Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?</l>
               <l>O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,</l>
               <l>How can we know the dancer from the dance?</l>
               <l>COLONUS' PRAISE</l>
               <l>Chorus. Come praise Colonus' horses, and come praise</l>
               <l>The wine-dark of the wood's intricacies,</l>
               <l>The nightingale that deafens daylight there,</l>
               <l>If daylight ever visit where,</l>
               <l>Unvisited by tempest or by sun,</l>
               <l>Immortal ladies tread the ground</l>
               <l>Dizzy with harmonious sound,</l>
               <l>Semele's lad a gay companion.</l>
               <l>And yonder in the gymnasts' garden thrives</l>
               <l>The self-sown, self-begotten shape that gives</l>
               <l>Athenian intellect its mastery,</l>
               <l>Even the grey-leaved olive-tree</l>
               <l>Miracle-bred out of the living stone;</l>
               <l>Nor accident of peace nor war</l>
               <l>Shall wither that old marvel, for</l>
               <l>The great grey-eyed Athene stareS thereon.</l>
               <l>Who comes into this country, and has come</l>
               <l>Where golden crocus and narcissus bloom,</l>
               <l>Where the Great Mother, mourning for her daughter</l>
               <l>And beauty-drunken by the water</l>
               <l>Glittering among grey-leaved olive-trees,</l>
               <l>Has plucked a flower and sung her loss;</l>
               <l>Who finds abounding Cephisus</l>
               <l>Has found the loveliest spectacle there is.</l>
               <l>because this country has a pious mind</l>
               <l>And so remembers that when all mankind</l>
               <l>But trod the road, or splashed about the shore,</l>
               <l>Poseidon gave it bit and oar,</l>
               <l>Every Colonus lad or lass discourses</l>
               <l>Of that oar and of that bit;</l>
               <l>Summer and winter, day and night,</l>
               <l>Of horses and horses of the sea, white horses.</l>
               <l>WISDOM</l>
               <l>THE true faith discovered was</l>
               <l>When painted panel, statuary.</l>
               <l>Glass-mosaic, window-glass,</l>
               <l>Amended what was told awry</l>
               <l>By some peasant gospeller;</l>
               <l>Swept the Sawdust from the floor</l>
               <l>Of that working-carpenter.</l>
               <l>Miracle had its playtime where</l>
               <l>In damask clothed and on a seat</l>
               <l>Chryselephantine, cedar-boarded,</l>
               <l>His majestic Mother sat</l>
               <l>Stitching at a purple hoarded</l>
               <l>That He might be nobly breeched</l>
               <l>In starry towers of Babylon</l>
               <l>Noah's freshet never reached.</l>
               <l>King Abundance got Him on</l>
               <l>Innocence; and Wisdom He.</l>
               <l>That cognomen sounded best</l>
               <l>Considering what wild infancy</l>
               <l>Drove horror from His Mother's breast.</l>
               <l>THE FOOL BY THE ROADSIDE</l>
               <l>WHEN all works that have</l>
               <l>From cradle run to grave</l>
               <l>From grave to cradle run instead;</l>
               <l>When thoughts that a fool</l>
               <l>Has wound upon a spool</l>
               <l>Are but loose thread, are but loose thread;</l>
               <l>When cradle and spool are past</l>
               <l>And I mere shade at last</l>
               <l>Coagulate of stuff</l>
               <l>Transparent like the wind,</l>
               <l>I think that I may find</l>
               <l>A faithful love, a faithful love.</l>
               <l>OWEN AHERNE AND HIS DANCERS</l>
               <l>A STRANGE thing surely that my Heart, when love had</l>
               <l>come unsought</l>
               <l>Upon the Norman upland or in that poplar shade,</l>
               <l>Should find no burden but itself and yet should be</l>
               <l>worn out.</l>
               <l>It could not bear that burden and therefore it went</l>
               <l>mad.</l>
               <l>The south wind brought it longing, and the east wind</l>
               <l>despair,</l>
               <l>The west wind made it pitiful, and the north wind</l>
               <l>afraid.</l>
               <l>It feared to give its love a hurt with all the tempest</l>
               <l>there;</l>
               <l>It feared the hurt that she could give and therefore it</l>
               <l>went mad.</l>
               <l>I can exchange opinion with any neighbouring mind,</l>
               <l>I have as healthy flesh and blood as any rhymer's had,</l>
               <l>But O! my Heart could bear no more when the upland</l>
               <l>caught the wind;</l>
               <l>I ran, I ran, from my love's side because my Heart went</l>
               <l>mad.</l>
               <l>   II</l>
               <l>The Heart behind its rib laughed out. `You have called</l>
               <l>me mad,' it said,</l>
               <l>`Because I made you turn away and run from that</l>
               <l>young child;</l>
               <l>How could she mate with fifty years that was so wildly</l>
               <l>bred?</l>
               <l>Let the cage bird and the cage bird mate and the wild</l>
               <l>bird mate in the wild.'</l>
               <l>`You but imagine lies all day, O murderer,' I replied.</l>
               <l>`And all those lies have but one end, poor wretches to</l>
               <l>betray;</l>
               <l>I did not find in any cage the woman at my side.</l>
               <l>O but her heart would break to learn my thoughts are</l>
               <l>far away.'</l>
               <l>'Speak all your mind,' my Heart sang out, `speak all</l>
               <l>your mind; who cares,</l>
               <l>Now that your tongue cannot persuade the child till</l>
               <l>she mistake</l>
               <l>Her childish gratitude for love and match your fifty</l>
               <l>years?</l>
               <l>O let her choose a young man now and all for his wild</l>
               <l>sake.'</l>
               <l>A MAN YOUNG AND OLD</l>
               <l>   I</l>
               <l>First Love</l>
               <l>THOUGH nurtured like the sailing moon</l>
               <l>In beauty's murderous brood,</l>
               <l>She walked awhile and blushed awhile</l>
               <l>And on my pathway stood</l>
               <l>Until I thought her body bore</l>
               <l>A heart of flesh and blood.</l>
               <l>But since I laid a hand thereon</l>
               <l>And found a heart of stone</l>
               <l>I have attempted many things</l>
               <l>And not a thing is done,</l>
               <l>For every hand is lunatic</l>
               <l>That travels on the moon.</l>
               <l>She smiled and that transfigured me</l>
               <l>And left me but a lout,</l>
               <l>Maundering here, and maundering there,</l>
               <l>Emptier of thought</l>
               <l>Than the heavenly circuit of its stars</l>
               <l>When the moon sails out.</l>
               <l>   II</l>
               <l>Human Dignity</l>
               <l>Like the moon her kindness is,</l>
               <l>If kindness I may call</l>
               <l>What has no comprehension in't,</l>
               <l>But is the same for all</l>
               <l>As though my sorrow were a scene</l>
               <l>Upon a painted wall.</l>
               <l>So like a bit of stone I lie</l>
               <l>Under a broken tree.</l>
               <l>I could recover if I shrieked</l>
               <l>My heart's agony</l>
               <l>To passing bird, but I am dumb</l>
               <l>From human dignity.</l>
               <l>   III</l>
               <l>The Mermaid </l>
               <l>A mermaid found a swimming lad,</l>
               <l>Picked him for her own,</l>
               <l>Pressed her body to his body,</l>
               <l>Laughed; and plunging down</l>
               <l>Forgot in cruel happiness</l>
               <l>That even lovers drown.</l>
               <l>   IV</l>
               <l>The Death of the Hare</l>
               <l>I have pointed out the yelling pack,</l>
               <l>The hare leap to the wood,</l>
               <l>And when I pass a compliment</l>
               <l>Rejoice as lover should</l>
               <l>At the drooping of an eye,</l>
               <l>At the mantling of the blood.</l>
               <l>Then' suddenly my heart is wrung</l>
               <l>By her distracted air</l>
               <l>And I remember wildness lost</l>
               <l>And after, swept from there,</l>
               <l>Am set down standing in the wood</l>
               <l>At the death of the hare.</l>
               <l>   V</l>
               <l>The Empty Cup</l>
               <l>A crazy man that found a cup,</l>
               <l>When all but dead of thirst,</l>
               <l>Hardly dared to wet his mouth</l>
               <l>Imagining, moon-accursed ,</l>
               <l>That another mouthful</l>
               <l>And his beating heart would burst.</l>
               <l>October last I found it too</l>
               <l>But found it dry as bone,</l>
               <l>And for that reason am I crazed</l>
               <l>And my sleep is gone.</l>
               <l>   VI</l>
               <l>His Memories</l>
               <l>We should be hidden from their eyes,</l>
               <l>Being but holy shows</l>
               <l>And bodies broken like a thorn</l>
               <l>Whereon the bleak north blows,</l>
               <l>To think of buried Hector</l>
               <l>And that none living knows.</l>
               <l>The women take so little stock</l>
               <l>In what I do or say</l>
               <l>They'd sooner leave their cosseting</l>
               <l>To hear a jackass bray;</l>
               <l>My arms are like the twisted thorn</l>
               <l>And yet there beauty lay;</l>
               <l>The first of all the tribe lay there</l>
               <l>And did such pleasure take — </l>
               <l>She who had brought great Hector down</l>
               <l>And put all Troy to wreck — </l>
               <l>That she cried into this ear,</l>
               <l>`Strike me if I shriek.'</l>
               <l>   VII</l>
               <l>The Friends of his Youth</l>
               <l>Laughter not time destroyed my voice</l>
               <l>And put that crack in it,</l>
               <l>And when the moon's pot-bellied</l>
               <l>I get a laughing fit,</l>
               <l>For that old Madge comes down the lane,</l>
               <l>A stone upon her breast,</l>
               <l>And a cloak wrapped about the stone,</l>
               <l>And she can get no rest</l>
               <l>With singing hush and hush-a-bye;</l>
               <l>She that has been wild</l>
               <l>And barren as a breaking wave</l>
               <l>Thinks that the stone's a child.</l>
               <l>And Peter that had great affairs</l>
               <l>And was a pushing man</l>
               <l>Shrieks, `I am King of the Peacocks,'</l>
               <l>And perches on a stone;</l>
               <l>And then I laugh till tears run down</l>
               <l>And the heart thumps at my side,</l>
               <l>Remembering that her shriek was love</l>
               <l>And that he shrieks from pride.</l>
               <l>   VIII</l>
               <l>Summer and Spring</l>
               <l>We sat under an old thorn-tree</l>
               <l>And talked away the night,</l>
               <l>Told all that had been said or done</l>
               <l>Since first we saw the light,</l>
               <l>And when we talked of growing up</l>
               <l>Knew that we'd halved a soul</l>
               <l>And fell the one in t'other's arms</l>
               <l>That we might make it whole;</l>
               <l>Then peter had a murdering look,</l>
               <l>For it seemed that he and she</l>
               <l>Had spoken of their childish days</l>
               <l>Under that very tree.</l>
               <l>O what a bursting out there was,</l>
               <l>And what a blossoming,</l>
               <l>When we had all the summer-time</l>
               <l>And she had all the spring!</l>
               <l>   IX</l>
               <l>The Secrets of the Old</l>
               <l>I have old women's secrets now</l>
               <l>That had those of the young;</l>
               <l>Madge tells me what I dared not think</l>
               <l>When my blood was strong,</l>
               <l>And what had drowned a lover once</l>
               <l>Sounds like an old song.</l>
               <l>Though Margery is stricken dumb</l>
               <l>If thrown in Madge's way,</l>
               <l>We three make up a solitude;</l>
               <l>For none alive to-day</l>
               <l>Can know the stories that we know</l>
               <l>Or say the things we say:</l>
               <l>How such a man pleased women most</l>
               <l>Of all that are gone,</l>
               <l>How such a pair loved many years</l>
               <l>And such a pair but one,</l>
               <l>Stories of the bed of straw</l>
               <l>Or the bed of down.</l>
               <l>   X</l>
               <l>His Wildness</l>
               <l>O bid me mount and sail up there</l>
               <l>Amid the cloudy wrack,</l>
               <l>For peg and Meg and Paris' love</l>
               <l>That had so straight a back,</l>
               <l>Are gone away, and some that stay</l>
               <l>Have changed their silk for sack.</l>
               <l>Were I but there and none to hear</l>
               <l>I'd have a peacock cry,</l>
               <l>For that is natural to a man</l>
               <l>That lives in memory,</l>
               <l>Being all alone I'd nurse a stone</l>
               <l>And sing it lullaby.</l>
               <l>   XI</l>
               <l>From 'Oedipus at Colonus'</l>
               <l>Endure what life God gives and ask no longer span;</l>
               <l>Cease to remember the delights of youth, travel-</l>
               <l>wearied aged man;</l>
               <l>Delight becomes death-longing if all longing else be</l>
               <l>vain.</l>
               <l>Even from that delight memory treasures so,</l>
               <l>Death, despair, division of families, all entanglements</l>
               <l>of mankind grow,</l>
               <l>As that old wandering beggar and these God-hated</l>
               <l>children know.</l>
               <l>In the long echoing street the laughing dancers throng,</l>
               <l>The bride is carried to the bridegroom's chamber</l>
               <l>through torchlight and tumultuous song;</l>
               <l>I celebrate the silent kiss that ends short life or long.</l>
               <l>Never to have lived is best, ancient writers say;</l>
               <l>Never to have drawn the breath of life, never to have</l>
               <l>looked into the eye of day;</l>
               <l>The second best's a gay goodnight and quickly turn</l>
               <l>away.</l>
               <l>THE THREE MONUMENTS</l>
               <l>THEY hold their public meetings where</l>
               <l>Our most renowned patriots stand,</l>
               <l>One among the birds of the air,</l>
               <l>A stumpier on either hand;</l>
               <l>And all the popular statesmen say</l>
               <l>That purity built up the State</l>
               <l>And after kept it from decay;</l>
               <l>And let all base ambition be,</l>
               <l>For intellect would make us proud</l>
               <l>And pride bring in impurity:</l>
               <l>The three old rascals laugh aloud.</l>
               <l>ALL SOULS' NIGHT</l>
               <l>Epilogue to `A Vision'</l>
               <l>MIDNIGHT has come, and the great Christ Church Bell</l>
               <l>And may a lesser bell sound through the room;</l>
               <l>And it is All Souls' Night,</l>
               <l>And two long glasses brimmed with muscatel</l>
               <l>Bubble upon the table. A ghost may come;</l>
               <l>For it is a ghost's right,</l>
               <l>His element is so fine</l>
               <l>Being sharpened by his death,</l>
               <l>To drink from the wine-breath</l>
               <l>While our gross palates drink from the whole wine.</l>
               <l>I need some mind that, if the cannon sound</l>
               <l>From every quarter of the world, can stay</l>
               <l>Wound in mind's pondering</l>
               <l>As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound;</l>
               <l>Because I have a marvellous thing to say,</l>
               <l>A certain marvellous thing</l>
               <l>None but the living mock,</l>
               <l>Though not for sober ear;</l>
               <l>It may be all that hear</l>
               <l>Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.</l>
               <l>Horton's the first I call. He loved strange thought</l>
               <l>And knew that sweet extremity of pride</l>
               <l>That's called platonic love,</l>
               <l>And that to such a pitch of passion wrought</l>
               <l>Nothing could bring him, when his lady died,</l>
               <l>Anodyne for his love.</l>
               <l>Words were but wasted breath;</l>
               <l>One dear hope had he:</l>
               <l>The inclemency</l>
               <l>Of that or the next winter would be death.</l>
               <l>Two thoughts were so mixed up I could not tell</l>
               <l>Whether of her or God he thought the most,</l>
               <l>But think that his mind's eye,</l>
               <l>When upward turned, on one sole image fell;</l>
               <l>And that a slight companionable ghost,</l>
               <l>Wild with divinity,</l>
               <l>Had so lit up the whole</l>
               <l>Immense miraculous house</l>
               <l>The Bible promised us,</l>
               <l>It seemed a gold-fish swimming in a bowl.</l>
               <l>On Florence Emery I call the next,</l>
               <l>Who finding the first wrinkles on a face</l>
               <l>Admired and beautiful,</l>
               <l>And knowing that the future would be vexed</l>
               <l>With 'minished beauty, multiplied commonplace,</l>
               <l>preferred to teach a school</l>
               <l>Away from neighbour or friend,</l>
               <l>Among dark skins, and there</l>
               <l>permit foul years to wear</l>
               <l>Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end.</l>
               <l>Before that end much had she ravelled out</l>
               <l>From a discourse in figurative speech</l>
               <l>By some learned Indian</l>
               <l>On the soul's journey. How it is whirled about,</l>
               <l>Wherever the orbit of the moon can reach,</l>
               <l>Until it plunge into the sun;</l>
               <l>And there, free and yet fast,</l>
               <l>Being both Chance and Choice,</l>
               <l>Forget its broken toys</l>
               <l>And sink into its own delight at last.</l>
               <l>And I call up MacGregor from the grave,</l>
               <l>For in my first hard springtime we were friends.</l>
               <l>Although of late estranged.</l>
               <l>I thought him half a lunatic, half knave,</l>
               <l>And told him so, but friendship never ends;</l>
               <l>And what if mind seem changed,</l>
               <l>And it seem changed with the mind,</l>
               <l>When thoughts rise up unbid</l>
               <l>On generous things that he did</l>
               <l>And I grow half contented to be blind!</l>
               <l>He had much industry at setting out,</l>
               <l>Much boisterous courage, before loneliness</l>
               <l>Had driven him crazed;</l>
               <l>For meditations upon unknown thought</l>
               <l>Make human intercourse grow less and less;</l>
               <l>They are neither paid nor praised.</l>
               <l>but he d object to the host,</l>
               <l>The glass because my glass;</l>
               <l>A ghost-lover he was</l>
               <l>And may have grown more arrogant being a ghost.</l>
               <l>But names are nothing. What matter who it be,</l>
               <l>So that his elements have grown so fine</l>
               <l>The fume of muscatel</l>
               <l>Can give his sharpened palate ecstasy</l>
               <l>No living man can drink from the whole wine.</l>
               <l>I have mummy truths to tell</l>
               <l>Whereat the living mock,</l>
               <l>Though not for sober ear,</l>
               <l>For maybe all that hear</l>
               <l>Should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock.</l>
               <l>Such thought — such thought have I that hold it tight</l>
               <l>Till meditation master all its parts,</l>
               <l>Nothing can stay my glance</l>
               <l>Until that glance run in the world's despite</l>
               <l>To where the damned have howled away their hearts,</l>
               <l>And where the blessed dance;</l>
               <l>Such thought, that in it bound</l>
               <l>I need no other thing,</l>
               <l>Wound in mind's wandering</l>
               <l>As mummies in the mummy-cloth are wound.</l>

            <l>1933</l>
            <l>IN MEMORY OF EVA GORE-BOOTH AND CON</l>
            <l>MARKIEWICZ</l>
            <l>THE light of evening, Lissadell,</l>
            <l>Great windows open to the south,</l>
            <l>Two girls in silk kimonos, both</l>
            <l>Beautiful, one a gazelle.</l>
            <l>But a raving autumn shears</l>
            <l>Blossom from the summer's wreath;</l>
            <l>The older is condemned to death,</l>
            <l>Pardoned, drags out lonely years</l>
            <l>Conspiring among the ignorant.</l>
            <l>I know not what the younger dreams — </l>
            <l>Some vague Utopia — and she seems,</l>
            <l>When withered old and skeleton-gaunt,</l>
            <l>An image of such politics.</l>
            <l>Many a time I think to seek</l>
            <l>One or the other out and speak</l>
            <l>Of that old Georgian mansion, mix</l>
            <l>pictures of the mind, recall</l>
            <l>That table and the talk of youth,</l>
            <l>Two girls in silk kimonos, both</l>
            <l>Beautiful, one a gazelle.</l>
            <l>Dear shadows, now you know it all,</l>
            <l>All the folly of a fight</l>
            <l>With a common wrong or right.</l>
            <l>The innocent and the beautiful.</l>
            <l>Have no enemy but time;</l>
            <l>Arise and bid me strike a match</l>
            <l>And strike another till time catch;</l>
            <l>Should the conflagration climb,</l>
            <l>Run till all the sages know.</l>
            <l>We the great gazebo built,</l>
            <l>They convicted us of guilt;</l>
            <l>Bid me strike a match and blow.</l>
            <l>DEATH</l>
            <l>NOR dread nor hope attend</l>
            <l>A dying animal;</l>
            <l>A man awaits his end</l>
            <l>Dreading and hoping all;</l>
            <l>Many times he died,</l>
            <l>Many times rose again.</l>
            <l>A great man in his pride</l>
            <l>Confronting murderous men</l>
            <l>Casts derision upon</l>
            <l>Supersession of breath;</l>
            <l>He knows death to the bone — </l>
            <l>Man has created death.</l>
            <l>A DIALOGUE OF SELF AND SOUL</l>
            <l>My Soul I summon to the winding ancient stair;</l>
            <l>Set all your mind upon the steep ascent,</l>
            <l>Upon the broken, crumbling battlement,</l>
            <l>Upon the breathless starlit air,</l>
            <l>"Upon the star that marks the hidden pole;</l>
            <l>Fix every wandering thought upon</l>
            <l>That quarter where all thought is done:</l>
            <l>Who can distinguish darkness from the soul</l>
            <l>My Self. The consecretes blade upon my knees</l>
            <l>Is Sato's ancient blade, still as it was,</l>
            <l>Still razor-keen, still like a looking-glass</l>
            <l>Unspotted by the centuries;</l>
            <l>That flowering, silken, old embroidery, torn</l>
            <l>From some court-lady's dress and round</l>
            <l>The wodden scabbard bound and wound</l>
            <l>Can, tattered, still protect, faded adorn</l>
            <l>My Soul. Why should the imagination of a man</l>
            <l>Long past his prime remember things that are</l>
            <l>Emblematical of love and war?</l>
            <l>Think of ancestral night that can,</l>
            <l>If but imagination scorn the earth</l>
            <l>And interllect is wandering</l>
            <l>To this and that and t'other thing,</l>
            <l>Deliver from the crime of death and birth.</l>
            <l>My self. Montashigi, third of his family, fashioned it</l>
            <l>Five hundred years ago, about it lie</l>
            <l>Flowers from I know not what embroidery — </l>
            <l>Heart's purple — and all these I set</l>
            <l>For emblems of the day against the tower</l>
            <l>Emblematical of the night,</l>
            <l>And claim as by a soldier's right</l>
            <l>A charter to commit the crime once more.</l>
            <l>My Soul. Such fullness in that quarter overflows</l>
            <l>And falls into the basin of the mind</l>
            <l>That man is stricken deaf and dumb and blind,</l>
            <l>For intellect no longer knows</l>
            <l>Is from the Ought, or knower from the
Known — </l>
            <l>That is to say, ascends to Heaven;</l>
            <l>Only the dead can be forgiven;</l>
            <l>But when I think of that my tongue's a stone.</l>
            <l>My Self. A living man is blind and drinks his drop.</l>
            <l>What matter if the ditches are impure?</l>
            <l>What matter if I live it all once more?</l>
            <l>Endure that toil of growing up;</l>
            <l>The ignominy of boyhood; the distress</l>
            <l>Of boyhood changing into man;</l>
            <l>The unfinished man and his pain</l>
            <l>Brought face to face with his own clumsiness;</l>
            <l>The finished man among his enemies? — </l>
            <l>How in the name of Heaven can he escape</l>
            <l>That defiling and disfigured shape</l>
            <l>The mirror of malicious eyes</l>
            <l>Casts upon his eyes until at last</l>
            <l>He thinks that shape must be his shape?</l>
            <l>And what's the good of an escape</l>
            <l>If honour find him in the wintry blast?</l>
            <l>I am content to live it all again</l>
            <l>And yet again, if it be life to pitch</l>
            <l>Into the frog-spawn of a blind man's ditch,</l>
            <l>A blind man battering blind men;</l>
            <l>Or into that most fecund ditch of all,</l>
            <l>The folly that man does</l>
            <l>Or must suffer, if he woos</l>
            <l>A proud woman not kindred of his soul.</l>
            <l>I am content to follow to its source</l>
            <l>Every event in action or in thought;</l>
            <l>Measure the lot; forgive myself the lot!</l>
            <l>When such as I cast out remorse</l>
            <l>So great a sweetness flows into the breast</l>
            <l>We must laugh and we must sing,</l>
            <l>We are blest by everything,</l>
            <l>Everything we look upon is blest.</l>
            <l>  BLOOD AND THE MOON</l>
            <l>BLESSED be this place,</l>
            <l>More blessed still this tower;</l>
            <l>A bloody, arrogant power</l>
            <l>Rose out of the race</l>
            <l>Uttering, mastering it,</l>
            <l>Rose like these walls from these</l>
            <l>Storm-beaten cottages — </l>
            <l>In mockery I have set</l>
            <l>A powerful emblem up,</l>
            <l>And sing it rhyme upon rhyme</l>
            <l>In mockery of a time</l>
            <l>HaIf dead at the top.</l>
            <l>Alexandria's was a beacon tower, and Babylon's</l>
            <l>An image of the moving heavens, a log-book of the</l>
            <l>sun's journey and the moon's;</l>
            <l>And Shelley had his towers, thought's crowned powers</l>
            <l>he called them once.</l>
            <l>I declare this tower is my symbol; I declare</l>
            <l>This winding, gyring, spiring treadmill of a stair is my</l>
            <l>ancestral stair;</l>
            <l>That Goldsmith and the Dean, Berkeley and Burke</l>
            <l>have travelled there.</l>
            <l>Swift beating on his breast in sibylline frenzy blind</l>
            <l>Because the heart in his blood-sodden breast had</l>
            <l>dragged him down into mankind,</l>
            <l>Goldsmith deliberately sipping at the honey-pot of his</l>
            <l>mind,</l>
            <l>And haughtier-headed Burke that proved the State a</l>
            <l>tree,</l>
            <l>That this unconquerable labyrinth of the birds, cen-</l>
            <l>tury after century,</l>
            <l>Cast but dead leaves to mathematical equality;</l>
            <l>And God-appointed Berkeley that proved all things a</l>
            <l>dream,</l>
            <l>That this pragmatical, preposterous pig of a world, its</l>
            <l>farrow that so solid seem,</l>
            <l>Must vanish on the instant if the mind but change its</l>
            <l>theme;</l>
            <l>Saeva Indignatio and the labourer's hire,</l>
            <l>The strength that gives our blood and state magnani-</l>
            <l>mity of its own desire;</l>
            <l>Everything that is not God consumed with intellectual</l>
            <l>fire.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>The purity of the unclouded moon</l>
            <l>Has flung its atrowy shaft upon the floor.</l>
            <l>Seven centuries have passed and it is pure,</l>
            <l>The blood of innocence has left no stain.</l>
            <l>There, on blood-saturated ground, have stood</l>
            <l>Soldier, assassin, executioner.</l>
            <l>Whether for daily pittance or in blind fear</l>
            <l>Or out of abstract hatred, and shed blood,</l>
            <l>But could not cast a single jet thereon.</l>
            <l>Odour of blood on the ancestral stair!</l>
            <l>And we that have shed none must gather there</l>
            <l>And clamour in drunken frenzy for the moon.</l>
            <l>IV</l>
            <l>Upon the dusty, glittering windows cling,</l>
            <l>And seem to cling upon the moonlit skies,</l>
            <l>Tortoiseshell butterflies, peacock butterflies,</l>
            <l>A couple of night-moths are on the wing.</l>
            <l>Is every modern nation like the tower,</l>
            <l>Half dead at the top? No matter what I said,</l>
            <l>For wisdom is the property of the dead,</l>
            <l>A something incompatible with life; and power,</l>
            <l>Like everything that has the stain of blood,</l>
            <l>A property of the living; but no stain</l>
            <l>Can come upon the visage of the moon</l>
            <l>When it has looked in glory from a cloud.</l>
            <l>OIL AND BLOOD</l>
            <l>IN tombs of gold and lapis lazuli</l>
            <l>Bodies of holy men and women exude</l>
            <l>Miraculous oil, odour of violet.</l>
            <l>But under heavy loads of trampled clay</l>
            <l>Lie bodies of the vampires full of blood;</l>
            <l>Their shrouds are bloody and their lips are wet.</l>
            <l>VERONICA'S NAPKIN</l>
            <l>THE Heavenly Circuit; Berenice's Hair;</l>
            <l>Tent-pole of Eden; the tent's drapery;</l>
            <l>Symbolical glory of thc earth and air!</l>
            <l>The Father and His angelic hierarchy</l>
            <l>That made the magnitude and glory there</l>
            <l>Stood in the circuit of a needle's eye.</l>
            <l>Some found a different pole, and where it stood</l>
            <l>A pattern on a napkin dipped in blood.</l>
            <l>SYMBOLS</l>
            <l>A STORM BEATEN old watch-tower,</l>
            <l>A blind hermit rings the hour.</l>
            <l>All-destroying sword-blade still</l>
            <l>Carried by the wandering fool.</l>
            <l>Gold-sewn silk on the sword-blade,</l>
            <l>Beauty and fool together laid.</l>
            <l>SPILT MILK</l>
            <l>WE that have done and thought,</l>
            <l>That have thought and done,</l>
            <l>Must ramble, and thin out</l>
            <l>Like milk spilt on a stone.</l>
            <l>THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND AFTER</l>
            <l>THOUGH the great song return no more</l>
            <l>There's keen delight in what we have:</l>
            <l>The rattle of pebbles on the shore</l>
            <l>Under the receding wave.</l>
            <l>STATISTICS</l>
            <l>"THOSE Platonists are a curse,' he said,</l>
            <l>"God's fire upon the wane,</l>
            <l>A diagram hung there instead,</l>
            <l>More women born than men.'</l>
            <l>THREE MOVEMENTS</l>
            <l>SHAKESPEAREAN fish swam the sea, far away from land;</l>
            <l>Romantic fish swam in nets coming to the hand;</l>
            <l>What are all those fish that lie gasping on the strand?</l>
            <l>THE SEVEN SAGES</l>
            <l>The First. My great-grandfather spoke to Edmund</l>
            <l>Burke</l>
            <l>In Grattan's house.</l>
            <l>The Second. My great-grandfather shared</l>
            <l>A pot-house bench with Oliver Goldsmith once.</l>
            <l>The Third. My great-grandfather's father talked of</l>
            <l>music,</l>
            <l>Drank tar-water with the Bishop of Cloyne.</l>
            <l>The Fourth. But mine saw Stella once.</l>
            <l>The Fifth. Whence came our thought?</l>
            <l>The Sixth. From four great minds that hated Whiggery.</l>
            <l>The Fifth. Burke was a Whig.</l>
            <l>The Sixth. Whether they knew or not,</l>
            <l>Goldsmith and Burke, Swift and the Bishop of</l>
            <l>Cloyne</l>
            <l>All hated Whiggery; but what is Whiggery?</l>
            <l>A levelling, rancorous, rational sort of mind</l>
            <l>That never looked out of the eye of a saint</l>
            <l>Or out of drunkard's eye.</l>
            <l>The Seventh. All's Whiggery now,</l>
            <l>But we old men are massed against the world.</l>
            <l>The First. American colonies, Ireland, France and India</l>
            <l>Harried, and Burke's great melody against it.</l>
            <l>The Second. Oliver Goldsmith sang what he had seen,</l>
            <l>Roads full of beggars, cattle in the fields,</l>
            <l>But never saw the trefoil stained with blood,</l>
            <l>The avenging leaf those fields raised up against it.</l>
            <l>The Fourth. The tomb of Swift wears it away.</l>
            <l>The Third. A voice</l>
            <l>Soft as the rustle of a reed from Cloyne</l>
            <l>That gathers volume; now a thunder-clap.</l>
            <l>The Sixtb. What schooling had these four?</l>
            <l>The Seventh. They walked the roads</l>
            <l>Mimicking what they heard, as children mimic;</l>
            <l>They understood that wisdom comes of beggary.</l>
            <l>THE CRAZED MOON</l>
            <l>CRAZED through much child-bearing</l>
            <l>The moon is staggering in the sky;</l>
            <l>Moon-struck by the despairing</l>
            <l>Glances of her wandering eye</l>
            <l>We grope, and grope in vain,</l>
            <l>For children born of her pain.</l>
            <l>Children dazed or dead!</l>
            <l>When she in all her virginal pride</l>
            <l>First trod on the mountain's head</l>
            <l>What stir ran through the countryside</l>
            <l>Where every foot obeyed her glance!</l>
            <l>What manhood led the dance!</l>
            <l>Fly-catchers of the moon,</l>
            <l>Our hands are blenched, our fingers seem</l>
            <l>But slender needles of bone;</l>
            <l>Blenched by that malicious dream</l>
            <l>They are spread wide that each</l>
            <l>May rend what comes in reach.</l>
            <l>COOLE PARK, 1929</l>
            <l>I MEDITATE upon a swallow's flight,</l>
            <l>Upon a aged woman and her house,</l>
            <l>A sycamore and lime-tree lost in night</l>
            <l>Although that western cloud is luminous,</l>
            <l>Great works constructed there in nature's spite</l>
            <l>For scholars and for poets after us,</l>
            <l>Thoughts long knitted into a single thought,</l>
            <l>A dance-like glory that those walls begot.</l>
            <l>There Hyde before he had beaten into prose</l>
            <l>That noble blade the Muses buckled on,</l>
            <l>There one that ruffled in a manly pose</l>
            <l>For all his timid heart, there that slow man,</l>
            <l>That meditative man, John Synge, and those</l>
            <l>Impetuous men, Shawe-Taylor and Hugh Lane,</l>
            <l>Found pride established in humility,</l>
            <l>A scene well Set and excellent company.</l>
            <l>They came like swallows and like swallows went,</l>
            <l>And yet a woman's powerful character</l>
            <l>Could keep a Swallow to its first intent;</l>
            <l>And half a dozen in formation there,</l>
            <l>That seemed to whirl upon a compass-point,</l>
            <l>Found certainty upon the dreaming air,</l>
            <l>The intellectual sweetness of those lines</l>
            <l>That cut through time or cross it withershins.</l>
            <l>Here, traveller, scholar, poet, take your stand</l>
            <l>When all those rooms and passages are gone,</l>
            <l>When nettles wave upon a shapeless mound</l>
            <l>And saplings root among the broken stone,</l>
            <l>And dedicate — eyes bent upon the ground,</l>
            <l>Back turned upon the brightness of the sun</l>
            <l>And all the sensuality of the shade — </l>
            <l>A moment's memory to that laurelled head.</l>
            <l>COOLE PARK AND BALLYLEE, 1931</l>
            <l>UNDER my window-ledge the waters race,</l>
            <l>Otters below and moor-hens on the top,</l>
            <l>Run for a mile undimmed in Heaven's face</l>
            <l>Then darkening through "dark' Raftery's "cellar' drop,</l>
            <l>Run underground, rise in a rocky place</l>
            <l>In Coole demesne, and there to finish up</l>
            <l>Spread to a lake and drop into a hole.</l>
            <l>What's water but the generated soul?</l>
            <l>Upon the border of that lake's a wood</l>
            <l>Now all dry sticks under a wintry sun,</l>
            <l>And in a copse of beeches there I stood,</l>
            <l>For Nature's pulled her tragic buskin on</l>
            <l>And all the rant's a mirror of my mood:</l>
            <l>At sudden thunder of the mounting swan</l>
            <l>I turned about and looked where branches break</l>
            <l>The glittering reaches of the flooded lake.</l>
            <l>Another emblem there! That stormy white</l>
            <l>But seems a concentration of the sky;</l>
            <l>And, like the soul, it sails into the sight</l>
            <l>And in the morning's gone, no man knows why;</l>
            <l>And is so lovely that it sets to right</l>
            <l>What knowledge or its lack had set awry,</l>
            <l>So atrogantly pure, a child might think</l>
            <l>It can be murdered with a spot of ink.</l>
            <l>Sound of a stick upon the floor, a sound</l>
            <l>From somebody that toils from chair to chair;</l>
            <l>Beloved books that famous hands have bound,</l>
            <l>Old marble heads, old pictures everywhere;</l>
            <l>Great rooms where travelled men and children found</l>
            <l>Content or joy; a last inheritor</l>
            <l>Where none has reigned that lacked a name and fame</l>
            <l>Or out of folly into folly came.</l>
            <l>A spot whereon the founders lived and died</l>
            <l>Seemed once more dear than life; ancestral trees,</l>
            <l>Or gardens rich in memory glorified</l>
            <l>Marriages, alliances and families,</l>
            <l>And every bride's ambition satisfied.</l>
            <l>Where fashion or mere fantasy decrees</l>
            <l>We shift about — all that great glory spent — </l>
            <l>Like some poor Arab tribesman and his tent.</l>
            <l>We were the last romantics — chose for theme</l>
            <l>Traditional sanctity and loveliness;</l>
            <l>Whatever's written in what poets name</l>
            <l>The book of the people; whatever most can bless</l>
            <l>The mind of man or elevate a rhyme;</l>
            <l>But all is changed, that high horse riderless,</l>
            <l>Though mounted in that saddle Homer rode</l>
            <l>Where the swan drifts upon a darkening flood.</l>
            <l>FOR ANNE GREGORY</l>
            <l>"NEVER shall a young man,</l>

            <l>Savage indignation there</l>

            <l>THE heron-billed pale cattle-birds</l>
            <l>That feed on some foul parasite</l>

            <l>Till the dawn break upon those mingled seas.</l>
            <l>Often at evening when a boy</l>
            <l>Would I carry to a friend — </l>
            <l>Hoping more substantial joy</l>

            <l>Not such as are in Newton's metaphor,</l>
            <l>But actual shells of Rosses' level shore.</l>
            <l>Greater glory in the Sun,</l>

            <l>Much on the Great Questioner;</l>
            <l>What He can question, what if questioned I</l>
            <l>Can with a fitting confidence reply.</l>
            <l>THE CHOICE</l>
            <l>The intellect of man is forced to choose</l>
            <l>perfection of the life, or of the work,</l>
            <l>And if it take the second must refuse</l>
            <l>A heavenly mansion, raging in the dark.</l>
            <l>When all that story's finished, what's the news?</l>
            <l>In luck or out the toil has left its mark:</l>
            <l>That old perplexity an empty purse,</l>
            <l>Or the day's vanity, the night's remorse.</l>
            <l>MOHINI CHATTERJEE</l>
            <l>I ASKED if I should pray.</l>

            <l>THE unpurged images of day recede;</l>
            <l>The Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed;</l>
            <l>Night resonance recedes, night walkers' song</l>
            <l>After great cathedral gong;</l>
            <l>A starlit or a moonlit dome disdains</l>
            <l>All that man is,</l>
            <l>All mere complexities,</l>
            <l>The fury and the mire of human veins.</l>
            <l>Before me floats an image, man or shade,</l>
            <l>Shade more than man, more image than a shade;</l>
            <l>For Hades' bobbin bound in mummy-cloth</l>
            <l>May unwind the winding path;</l>
            <l>A mouth that has no moisture and no breath</l>
            <l>Breathless mouths may summon;</l>
            <l>I hail the superhuman;</l>
            <l>I call it death-in-life and life-in-death.</l>
            <l>Miracle, bird or golden handiwork,</l>
            <l>More miraclc than bird or handiwork,</l>
            <l>Planted on the star-lit golden bough,</l>
            <l>Can like the cocks of Hades crow,</l>
            <l>Or, by the moon embittered, scorn aloud</l>
            <l>In glory of changeless metal</l>
            <l>Common bird or petal</l>
            <l>And all complexities of mire or blood.</l>
            <l>At midnight on the Emperor's pavement flit</l>
            <l>Flames that no faggot feeds, nor steel has lit,</l>
            <l>Nor storm disturbs, flames begotten of flame,</l>
            <l>Where blood-begotten spirits come</l>
            <l>And all complexities of fury leave,</l>
            <l>Dying into a dance,</l>
            <l>An agony of trance,</l>
            <l>An agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve.</l>
            <l>Astraddle on the dolphin's mire and blood,</l>
            <l>Spirit after Spirit! The smithies break the flood.</l>
            <l>The golden smithies of the Emperor!</l>
            <l>Marbles of the dancing floor</l>
            <l>Break bitter furies of complexity,</l>
            <l>Those images that yet</l>
            <l>Fresh images beget,</l>
            <l>That dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea.</l>
            <l>THE MOTHER OF GOD</l>
            <l>THE threefold terror of love; a fallen flare</l>
            <l>Through the hollow of an ear;</l>
            <l>Wings beating about the room;</l>
            <l>The terror of all terrors that I bore</l>
            <l>The Heavens in my womb.</l>
            <l>Had I not found content among the shows</l>
            <l>Every common woman knows,</l>
            <l>Chimney corner, garden walk,</l>
            <l>Or rocky cistern where we tread the clothes</l>
            <l>And gather all the talk?</l>
            <l>What is this flesh I purchased with my pains,</l>
            <l>This fallen star my milk sustains,</l>
            <l>This love that makes my heart's blood stop</l>
            <l>Or strikes a Sudden chill into my bones</l>

            <l>BETWEEN extremities</l>
            <l>Man runs his course;</l>
            <l>A brand, or flaming breath.</l>
            <l>Comes to destroy</l>
            <l>All those antinomies</l>
            <l>Of day and night;</l>
            <l>The body calls it death,</l>
            <l>The heart remorse.</l>
            <l>But if these be right</l>
            <l>What is joy?</l>
            <l>II</l>
            <l>A tree there is that from its topmost bough</l>
            <l>Is half all glittering flame and half all green</l>
            <l>Abounding foliage moistened with the dew;</l>
            <l>And half is half and yet is all the scene;</l>
            <l>And half and half consume what they renew,</l>
            <l>And he that Attis' image hangs between</l>
            <l>That staring fury and the blind lush leaf</l>
            <l>May know not what he knows, but knows not grief</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>Get all the gold and silver that you can,</l>
            <l>Satisfy ambition, animate</l>
            <l>The trivial days and ram them with the sun,</l>
            <l>And yet upon these maxims meditate:</l>
            <l>All women dote upon an idle man</l>
            <l>Although their children need a rich estate;</l>
            <l>No man has ever lived that had enough</l>
            <l>Of children's gratitude or woman's love.</l>
            <l>No longer in Lethean foliage caught</l>
            <l>Begin the preparation for your death</l>
            <l>And from the fortieth winter by that thought</l>
            <l>Test every work of intellect or faith,</l>
            <l>And everything that your own hands have wrought</l>
            <l>And call those works extravagance of breath</l>
            <l>That are not suited for such men as come</l>
            <l>proud, open-eyed and laughing to the tomb.</l>
            <l>IV</l>
            <l>My fiftieth year had come and gone,</l>
            <l>I sat, a solitary man,</l>
            <l>In a crowded London shop,</l>
            <l>An open book and empty cup</l>
            <l>On the marble table-top.</l>
            <l>While on the shop and street I gazed</l>
            <l>My body of a sudden blazed;</l>
            <l>And twenty minutes more or less</l>
            <l>It seemed, so great my happiness,</l>
            <l>That I was blessed and could bless.</l>
            <l>Although the summer Sunlight gild</l>
            <l>Cloudy leafage of the sky,</l>
            <l>Or wintry moonlight sink the field</l>
            <l>In storm-scattered intricacy,</l>
            <l>I cannot look thereon,</l>
            <l>Responsibility so weighs me down.</l>
            <l>Things said or done long years ago,</l>
            <l>Or things I did not do or say</l>
            <l>But thought that I might say or do,</l>
            <l>Weigh me down, and not a day</l>
            <l>But something is recalled,</l>
            <l>My conscience or my vanity appalled.</l>
            <l>A rivery field spread out below,</l>
            <l>An odour of the new-mown hay</l>
            <l>In his nostrils, the great lord of Chou</l>
            <l>Cried, casting off the mountain snow,</l>
            <l>"Let all things pass away.'</l>
            <l>Wheels by milk-white asses drawn</l>
            <l>Where Babylon or Nineveh</l>
            <l>Rose; some conquer drew rein</l>
            <l>And cried to battle-weary men,</l>
            <l>"Let all things pass away.'</l>
            <l>From man's blood-sodden heart are sprung</l>
            <l>Those branches of the night and day</l>
            <l>Where the gaudy moon is hung.</l>
            <l>What's the meaning of all song?</l>
            <l>"Let all things pass away.'</l>
            <l>VII</l>
            <l>The Soul. Seek out reality, leave things that seem.</l>
            <l>The Heart. What, be a singer born and lack a theme?</l>
            <l>The Soul. Isaiah's coal, what more can man desire?</l>
            <l>The Heart. Struck dumb in the simplicity of fire!</l>
            <l>The Soul. Look on that fire, salvation walks within.</l>
            <l>The Heart. What theme had Homer but original sin?</l>
            <l>VIII</l>
            <l>Must we part, Von Hugel, though much alike, for we</l>
            <l>Accept the miracles of the saints and honour sanctity?</l>
            <l>The body of Saint Teresa lies undecayed in tomb,</l>
            <l>Bathed in miraculous oil, sweet odours from it come,</l>

            <l>All could be known or shown</l>

            <l>I tremble to the bone,</l>
            <l>The more I leave the door unlatched</l>
            <l>The sooner love is gone,</l>
            <l>For love is but a skein unwound</l>
            <l>Between the dark and dawn.</l>
            <l>A lonely ghost the ghost is</l>
            <l>That to God shall come;</l>

            <l>My body in the tomb — </l>
            <l>Shall leap into the light lost</l>
            <l>In my mother's womb.</l>
            <l>But were I left to lie alone</l>
            <l>In an empty bed,</l>
            <l>The skein so bound us ghost to ghost</l>
            <l>When he turned his head</l>
            <l>passing on the road that night,</l>
            <l>Mine must walk when dead.</l>

            <l>I had wild Jack for a lover;</l>
            <l>Though like a road</l>
            <l>That men pass over</l>
            <l>My body makes no moan</l>

            <l>`Those breasts are flat and fallen now,</l>
            <l>Those veins must soon be dry;</l>

            <l>`Fair and foul are near of kin,</l>
            <l>And fair needs foul,' I cried.</l>
            <l>`My friends are gone, but that's a truth</l>
            <l>Nor grave nor bed denied,</l>
            <l>Learned in bodily lowliness</l>
            <l>And in the heart's pride.</l>
            <l>`A woman can be proud and stiff</l>
            <l>When on love intent;</l>
            <l>But Love has pitched his mansion in</l>
            <l>The place of excrement;</l>
            <l>For nothing can be sole or whole</l>
            <l>That has not been rent.'</l>

            <l>I FOUND that ivory image there</l>
            <l>Dancing with her chosen youth,</l>
            <l>But when he wound her coal-black hair</l>
            <l>As though to strangle her, no scream</l>
            <l>Or bodily movement did I dare,</l>
            <l>Eyes under eyelids did so gleam;</l>
            <l>Love is like the lion's tooth.</l>
            <l>When She, and though some said she played</l>
            <l>I said that she had danced heart's truth,</l>
            <l>Drew a knife to strike him dead,</l>
            <l>I could but leave him to his fate;</l>
            <l>For no matter what is said</l>
            <l>They had all that had their hate;</l>
            <l>Love is like the lion's tooth.</l>
            <l>Did he die or did she die?</l>
            <l>Seemed to die or died they both?</l>
            <l>God be with the times when I</l>
            <l>Cared not a thraneen for what chanced</l>
            <l>So that I had the limbs to try</l>
            <l>Such a dance as there was danced — </l>

            <l>I WENT out alone</l>
            <l>To sing a song or two,</l>
            <l>My fancy on a man,</l>
            <l>And you know who.</l>
            <l>Another came in sight</l>
            <l>That on a stick relied</l>
            <l>To hold himself upright;</l>
            <l>I sat and cried.</l>
            <l>And that was all my song — </l>
            <l>When everything is told,</l>
            <l>Saw I an old man young</l>
            <l>Or young man old?</l>

            <l>The heart in my side,</l>
            <l>That so still had lain,</l>
            <l>In noble rage replied</l>
            <l>And beat upon the bone:</l>
            <l>`Uplift those eyes and throw</l>
            <l>Those glances unafraid:</l>

            <l>No withered crone I saw</l>
            <l>Before the world was made.'</l>
            <l>Abashed by that report,</l>

            <l>WHO talks of Plato's spindle;</l>
            <l>What set it whirling round?</l>
            <l>Eternity may dwindle,</l>
            <l>Time is unwound,</l>
            <l>Dan and Jerry Lout</l>
            <l>Change their loves about.</l>
            <l>However they may take it,</l>
            <l>Before the thread began</l>
            <l>I made, and may not break it</l>
            <l>When the last thread has run,</l>
            <l>A bargain with that hair</l>
            <l>And all the windings there.</l>
            <l>   XV</l>
            <l>THREE THINGS</l>
            <l>`O CRUEL Death, give three things back,'</l>
            <l>Sang a bone upon the shore;</l>
            <l>`A child found all a child can lack,</l>
            <l>Whether of pleasure or of rest,</l>
            <l>Upon the abundance of my breast':</l>
            <l>A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.</l>
            <l>`Three dear things that women know,'</l>
            <l>Sang a bone upon the shore;</l>
            <l>`A man if I but held him so</l>
            <l>When my body was alive</l>
            <l>Found all the pleasure that life gave':</l>
            <l>A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.</l>
            <l>`The third thing that I think of yet,'</l>
            <l>Sang a bone upon the shore,</l>
            <l>`Is that morning when I met</l>
            <l>Face to face my rightful man</l>
            <l>And did after stretch and yawn':</l>
            <l>A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.</l>
            <l>XVI</l>
            <l>LULLABY</l>
            <l>BELOVED, may your sleep be sound</l>
            <l>That have found it where you fed.</l>
            <l>What were all the world's alarms</l>
            <l>To mighty paris when he found</l>
            <l>Sleep upon a golden bed</l>
            <l>That first dawn in Helen's arms?</l>
            <l>Sleep, beloved, such a sleep</l>
            <l>As did that wild Tristram know</l>
            <l>When, the potion's work being done,</l>
            <l>Roe could run or doe could leap</l>
            <l>Under oak and beechen bough,</l>
            <l>Roe could leap or doe could run;</l>
            <l>Such a sleep and sound as fell</l>
            <l>Upon Eurotas' grassy bank</l>
            <l>When the holy bird, that there</l>
            <l>Accomplished his predestined will,</l>
            <l>From the limbs of Leda sank</l>
            <l>But not from her protecting care.</l>
            <l>XVII</l>
            <l>AFTER LONG SILENCE</l>
            <l>SPEECH after long silence; it is right,</l>
            <l>All other lovers being estranged or dead,</l>
            <l>Unfriendly lamplight hid under its shade,</l>
            <l>The curtains drawn upon unfriendly night,</l>
            <l>That we descant and yet again descant</l>
            <l>Upon the supreme theme of Art and Song:</l>
            <l>Bodily decrepitude is wisdom; young</l>
            <l>We loved each other and were ignorant.</l>
            <l>XVIII</l>
            <l>MAD AS THE MIST AND SNOW</l>
            <l>BOLT and bar the shutter,</l>
            <l>For the foul winds blow:</l>
            <l>Our minds are at their best this night,</l>
            <l>And I seem to know</l>
            <l>That everything outside us is</l>
            <l>Mad as the mist and snow.</l>
            <l>Horace there by Homer stands,</l>
            <l>Plato stands below,</l>
            <l>And here is Tully's open page.</l>
            <l>How many years ago</l>
            <l>Were you and I unlettered lads</l>
            <l>Mad as the mist and snow?</l>
            <l>You ask what makes me sigh, old friend,</l>
            <l>What makes me shudder so?</l>
            <l>I shudder and I sigh to think</l>
            <l>That even Cicero</l>
            <l>And many-minded Homer were</l>
            <l>Mad as the mist and snow.</l>
            <l>XIX</l>
            <l>THOSE DANCING DAYS ARE GONE</l>
            <l>COME, let me sing into your ear;</l>
            <l>Those dancing days are gone,</l>
            <l>All that silk and satin gear;</l>
            <l>Crouch upon a stone,</l>
            <l>Wrapping that foul body up</l>
            <l>In as foul a rag:</l>
            <l>I carry the sun in a golden cup.</l>
            <l>The moon in a silver bag.</l>
            <l>Curse as you may I sing it through;</l>
            <l>What matter if the knave</l>
            <l>That the most could pleasure you,</l>
            <l>The children that he gave,</l>
            <l>Are somewhere sleeping like a top</l>
            <l>Under a marble flag?</l>
            <l>I carry the sun in a golden cup.</l>
            <l>The moon in a silver bag.</l>
            <l>I thought it out this very day.</l>
            <l>Noon upon the clock,</l>
            <l>A man may put pretence away</l>
            <l>Who leans upon a stick,</l>
            <l>May sing, and sing until he drop,</l>
            <l>Whether to maid or hag:</l>
            <l>I carry the sun in a golden cup,</l>
            <l>The moon in a silver bag.</l>

            <l> AM of Ireland,</l>

            <l>One solitary man</l>
            <l>Of all that rambled there</l>
            <l>Had turned his stately head.</l>
            <l>That is a long way off,</l>
            <l>And time runs on,' he said,</l>
            <l>`And the night grows rough.'</l>

            <l>The drums and the kettledrums</l>
            <l>And the trumpets all are burst,</l>
            <l>And the trombone,' cried he,</l>
            <l>`The trumpet and trombone,'</l>
            <l>And cocked a malicious eye,</l>
            <l>`But time runs on, runs on.'</l>
            <l>I am of Ireland,</l>
            <l>And the Holy Land of Ireland,</l>
            <l>And time runs on,' cried she.</l>
            <l>`Come out of charity</l>

            <l>THE DANCER AT CRUACHAN AND CRO-PATRICK</l>

            <l>One that is perfect or at peace.</l>
            <l>Danced on Cruachan's windy plain,</l>
            <l>Upon Cro-patrick sang aloud;</l>

            <l>That sleeps under the canopy:</l>
            <l>`What change has put my thoughts astray</l>
            <l>And eyes that had s-o keen a sight?</l>
            <l>What has turned to smoking wick</l>
            <l>Nature's pure unchanging light?</l>

            <l>What most could shake his soul:</l>

            <l>Though fantastic men suppose</l>
            <l>Building-yard and stormy shore,</l>

            <l>Before the world was made.</l>
            <l>What if I look upon a man</l>
            <l>As though on my beloved,</l>

            <l>And my heart unmoved?</l>

            <l>Or that he is betrayed?</l>
            <l>I'd have him love the thing that was</l>

            <l>III</l>
            <l>A FIRST CONFESSION</l>
            <l>I ADMIT the briar</l>
            <l>Entangled in my hair</l>
            <l>Did not injure me;</l>
            <l>My blenching and trembling,</l>

            <l>Brings such satisfaction</l>

            <l>Brightness that I pull back</l>
            <l>From the Zodiac,</l>
            <l>Why those questioning eyes</l>
            <l>That are fixed upon me?</l>
            <l>What can they do but shun me</l>
            <l>If empty night replies?</l>
            <l>IV</l>
            <l>HER TRIUMPH</l>
            <l>I DID the dragon's will until you came</l>
            <l>Because I had fancied love a casual</l>
            <l>Improvisation, or a settled game</l>
            <l>That followed if I let the kerchief fall:</l>
            <l>Those deeds were best that gave the minute wings</l>
            <l>And heavenly music if they gave it wit;</l>
            <l>And then you stood among the dragon-rings.</l>
            <l>I mocked, being crazy, but you mastered it</l>
            <l>And broke the chain and set my ankles free,</l>
            <l>Saint George or else a pagan Perseus;</l>
            <l>And now we stare astonished at the sea,</l>
            <l>And a miraculous strange bird shrieks at us.</l>
            <l>V</l>
            <l>CONSOLATION</l>
            <l>O BUT there is wisdom</l>
            <l>In what the sages said;</l>
            <l>But stretch that body for a while</l>
            <l>And lay down that head</l>
            <l>Till I have told the sages</l>
            <l>Where man is comforted.</l>
            <l>How could passion run so deep</l>
            <l>Had I never thought</l>
            <l>That the crime of being born</l>
            <l>Blackens all our lot?</l>
            <l>But where the crime's committed</l>
            <l>The crime can be forgot.</l>
            <l>VI</l>
            <l>CHOSEN</l>
            <l>THE lot of love is chosen. I learnt that much</l>
            <l>Struggling for an image on the track</l>
            <l>Of the whirling Zodiac.</l>
            <l>Scarce did he my body touch,</l>
            <l>Scarce sank he from the west</l>
            <l>Or found a subtetranean rest</l>
            <l>On the maternal midnight of my breast</l>
            <l>Before I had marked him on his northern way,</l>
            <l>And seemed to stand although in bed I lay.</l>
            <l>I struggled with the horror of daybreak,</l>
            <l>I chose it for my lot! If questioned on</l>
            <l>My utmost pleasure with a man</l>
            <l>By some new-married bride, I take</l>
            <l>That stillness for a theme</l>
            <l>Where his heart my heart did seem</l>
            <l>And both adrift on the miraculous stream</l>
            <l>Where — wrote a learned astrologer — </l>
            <l>The Zodiac is changed into a sphere.</l>
            <l>VII</l>
            <l>PARTING</l>
            <l>He. Dear, I must be gone</l>
            <l>While night Shuts the eyes</l>
            <l>Of the household spies;</l>
            <l>That song announces dawn.</l>
            <l>She. No, night's bird and love's</l>
            <l>Bids all true lovers rest,</l>
            <l>While his loud song reproves</l>
            <l>The murderous stealth of day.</l>
            <l>He. Daylight already flies</l>
            <l>From mountain crest to crest</l>
            <l>She. That light is from the moom.</l>
            <l>He. That bird ...</l>
            <l>She. Let him sing on,</l>
            <l>I offer to love's play</l>
            <l>My dark declivities.</l>
            <l>VIII</l>
            <l>HER VISION IN THE WOOD</l>
            <l>DRY timber under that rich foliage,</l>
            <l>At wine-dark midnight in the sacred wood,</l>
            <l>Too old for a man's love I stood in rage</l>
            <l>Imagining men. Imagining that I could</l>
            <l>A greater with a lesser pang assuage</l>
            <l>Or but to find if withered vein ran blood,</l>
            <l>I tore my body that its wine might cover</l>
            <l>Whatever could rccall the lip of lover.</l>
            <l>And after that I held my fingers up,</l>
            <l>Stared at the wine-dark nail, or dark that ran</l>
            <l>Down every withered finger from the top;</l>
            <l>But the dark changed to red, and torches shone,</l>
            <l>And deafening music shook the leaves ; a troop</l>
            <l>Shouldered a litter with a wounded man,</l>
            <l>Or smote upon the string and to the sound</l>
            <l>Sang of the beast that gave the fatal wound.</l>
            <l>All stately women moving to a song</l>
            <l>With loosened hair or foreheads grief-distraught,</l>
            <l>It seemed a Quattrocento painter's throng,</l>
            <l>A thoughtless image of Mantegna's thought — </l>
            <l>Why should they think that are for ever young?</l>
            <l>Till suddenly in grief's contagion caught,</l>
            <l>I stared upon his blood-bedabbled breast</l>
            <l>And sang my malediction with the rest.</l>
            <l>That thing all blood and mire, that beast-torn wreck,</l>
            <l>Half turned and fixed a glazing eye on mine,</l>
            <l>And, though love's bitter-sweet had all come back,</l>
            <l>Those bodies from a picture or a coin</l>
            <l>Nor saw my body fall nor heard it shriek,</l>
            <l>Nor knew, drunken with singing as with wine,</l>
            <l>That they had brought no fabulous symbol there</l>
            <l>But my heart's victim and its torturer.</l>
            <l>IX</l>
            <l>A LAST CONFESSION</l>
            <l>WHAT lively lad most pleasured me</l>
            <l>Of all that with me lay?</l>
            <l>I answer that I gave my soul</l>
            <l>And loved in misery,</l>
            <l>But had great pleasure with a lad</l>
            <l>That I loved bodily.</l>
            <l>Flinging from his arms I laughed</l>
            <l>To think his passion such</l>
            <l>He fancied that I gave a soul</l>
            <l>Did but our bodies touch,</l>
            <l>And laughed upon his breast to think</l>
            <l>Beast gave beast as much.</l>
            <l>I gave what other women gave</l>
            <l>"That stepped out of their clothes.</l>
            <l>But when this soul, its body off,</l>
            <l>Naked to naked goes,</l>
            <l>He it has found shall find therein</l>
            <l>What none other knows,</l>
            <l>And give his own and take his own</l>
            <l>And rule in his own right;</l>
            <l>And though it loved in misery</l>
            <l>Close and cling so tight,</l>
            <l>There's not a bird of day that dare</l>
            <l>Extinguish that delight.</l>
            <l>X</l>
            <l>MEETING</l>
            <l>HIDDEN by old age awhile</l>
            <l>In masker's cloak and hood,</l>
            <l>Each hating what the other loved,</l>
            <l>Face to face we stood:</l>
            <l>"That I have met with such,' said he,</l>
            <l>"Bodes me little good.'</l>
            <l>"Let others boast their fill,' said I,</l>
            <l>"But never dare to boast</l>
            <l>That such as I had such a man</l>
            <l>For lover in the past;</l>
            <l>Say that of living men I hate</l>
            <l>Such a man the most.'</l>
            <l>'A loony'd boast of such a love,'</l>
            <l>He in his rage declared:</l>
            <l>But such as he for such as me — </l>
            <l>Could we both discard</l>
            <l>This beggarly habiliment — </l>
            <l>Had found a sweeter word.</l>
            <l>XI</l>
            <l>FROM THE 'ANTIGONE'</l>
            <l>OVERCOME — O bitter sweetness,</l>
            <l>Inhabitant of the soft cheek of a girl — </l>
            <l>The rich man and his affairs,</l>
            <l>The fat flocks and the fields' fatness,</l>
            <l>Mariners, rough harvesters;</l>
            <l>Overcome Gods upon Parnassus;</l>
            <l>Overcome the Empyrean; hurl</l>
            <l>Heaven and Earth out of their places,</l>
            <l>That in the Same calamity</l>
            <l>Brother and brother, friend and friend,</l>
            <l>Family and family,</l>
            <l>City and city may contend,</l>
            <l>By that great glory driven wild.</l>
            <l>Pray I will and sing I must,</l>
            <l>And yet I weep — Oedipus' child</l>
            <l>Descends into the loveless dust.</l>

            <l>PARNELL'S FUNERAL</l>
            <l>UNDER the Great Comedian's tomb the crowd.</l>
            <l>A bundle of tempestuous cloud is blown</l>
            <l>About the sky; where that is clear of cloud</l>
            <l>Brightness remains; a brighter star shoots down;</l>
            <l>What shudders run through all that animal blood?</l>
            <l>What is this sacrifice? Can someone there</l>
            <l>Recall the Cretan barb that pierced a star?</l>
            <l>Rich foliage that the starlight glittered through,</l>
            <l>A frenzied crowd, and where the branches sprang</l>
            <l>A beautiful seated boy; a sacred bow;</l>
            <l>A woman, and an arrow on a string;</l>
            <l>A pierced boy, image of a star laid low.</l>
            <l>That woman, the Great Mother imaging,</l>
            <l>Cut out his heart. Some master of design</l>
            <l>Stamped boy and tree upon Sicilian coin.</l>
            <l>An age is the reversal of an age:</l>
            <l>When strangers murdered Emmet, Fitzgerald, Tone,</l>
            <l>We lived like men that watch a painted stage.</l>
            <l>What matter for the scene, the scene once gone:</l>
            <l>It had not touched our lives. But popular rage,</l>
            <l>Hysterica passio dragged this quarry down.</l>
            <l>None shared our guilt; nor did we play a part</l>
            <l>Upon a painted stage when we devoured his heart.</l>
            <l>Come, fix upon me that accusing eye.</l>
            <l>I thirst for accusation. All that was sung.</l>
            <l>All that was said in Ireland is a lie</l>
            <l>Bred out of the contagion of the throng,</l>
            <l>Saving the rhyme rats hear before they die.</l>
            <l>Leave nothing but the nothingS that belong</l>
            <l>To this bare soul, let all men judge that can</l>
            <l>Whether it be an animal or a man.</l>
            <l>The rest I pass, one sentence I unsay.</l>
            <l>Had de Valera eaten parnell's heart</l>
            <l>No loose-lipped demagogue had won the day.</l>
            <l>No civil rancour torn the land apart.</l>
            <l>Had Cosgrave eaten parnell's heart, the land's</l>
            <l>Imagination had been satisfied,</l>
            <l>Or lacking that, government in such hands.</l>
            <l>O'Higgins its sole statesman had not died.</l>
            <l>Had even O'Duffy — but I name no more — </l>
            <l>Their school a crowd, his master solitude;</l>
            <l>Through Jonathan Swift's clark grove he passed, and</l>
            <l>there</l>
            <l>plucked bitter wisdom that enriched his blood.</l>
            <l>THREE SONGS TO THE SAME TUNE</l>
            <l>I</l>
            <l>GRANDFATHER sang it under the gallows:</l>
            <l>` Hear, gentlemen, ladies, and all mankind:</l>
            <l>Money is good and a girl might be better.</l>
            <l>But good strong blows are delights to the mind.'</l>
            <l>There, standing on the cart,</l>
            <l>He sang it from his heart.</l>
            <l>Those fanatics all that we do would undo;</l>
            <l>Down the fanatic, down the clown;</l>
            <l>Down, down, hammer them down,</l>
            <l>Down to the tune of O'Donnell Abu.</l>
            <l>`A girl I had, but she followed another,</l>
            <l>Money I had, and it went in the night,</l>
            <l>Strong drink I had, and it brought me to sorrow,</l>
            <l>But a good strong cause and blows are delight.'</l>
            <l>All there caught up the tune:</l>
            <l>`On, on, my darling man'.</l>
            <l>Those fanatics all that we do would undo;</l>
            <l>Down the fanatic, down the clown;</l>
            <l>Down, down, hammer them down,</l>
            <l>Down to the tune of O'Donnell Abu.</l>
            <l>`Money is good and a girl might be better,</l>
            <l>No matter what happens and who takes the fall,</l>
            <l>But a good strong cause' — the rope gave a jerk there,</l>
            <l>No more sang he, for his throat was too small;</l>
            <l>But he kicked before he died,</l>
            <l>He did it out of pride.</l>
            <l>Those fanatics all that we do would undo;</l>
            <l>Down the fanatic, down the clown;</l>
            <l>Down, down, hammer them down,</l>
            <l>Down to the tune of O'Donnell Abu.</l>
            <l>II</l>
            <l>Justify all those renowned generations;</l>
            <l>They left their bodies to fatten the wolves,</l>
            <l>They left their homesteads to fatten the foxes,</l>
            <l>Fled to far countries, or sheltered themselves</l>
            <l>In cavern, crevice, hole,</l>
            <l>Defending Ireland's soul.</l>
            <l>`Drown all the dogs,' said the fierce young woman,</l>
            <l>`They killed my goose and a cat.</l>
            <l>Drown, drown in the water-but,</l>
            <l>Drown all the dogs,' said the fierce young woman.</l>
            <l>Justify all those renowned generations,</l>
            <l>Justify all that have sunk in their blood,</l>
            <l>Justify all that have died on the scaffold,</l>
            <l>Justify all that have fled, that have stood,</l>
            <l>Stood or have marched the night long</l>
            <l>Singing, singing a song.</l>
            <l>`Drown all the dogs,' said the fierce young woman.</l>
            <l>`They killed my goose and a cat.</l>
            <l>Drown, drown in the water-butt,</l>
            <l>Drown all the dogs,' said the fierce young woman.</l>
            <l>Fail, and that history turns into rubbish,</l>
            <l>All that great past to a trouble of fools;</l>
            <l>Those that come after shall mock at O'Donnell,</l>
            <l>Mock at the memory of both O'Neills,</l>
            <l>Mock Emmet, mock Parnell:</l>
            <l>All the renown that fell.</l>
            <l>`Drown all the dogs,' said the fierce young woman,</l>
            <l>`They killed my goose and a cat.</l>
            <l>Drown, drown in the water-butt,</l>
            <l>Drown all the dogs,' said the fierce young woman.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>The soldier takes pride in saluting his Captain,</l>
            <l>The devotee proffers a knee to his Lord,</l>
            <l>Some back a mare thrown from a thoroughbred,</l>
            <l>Troy backed its Helen; Troy died and adored;</l>
            <l>Great nations blossom above;</l>
            <l>A slave bows down to a slave.</l>
            <l>Who'd care to dig 'em,' said the old, old man,</l>
            <l>`Those six feet marked in chalk?</l>
            <l>Much I talk, more I walk;</l>
            <l>Time I were buried,' said the old, old man.</l>
            <l>When nations are empty up there at the top,</l>
            <l>When order has weakened or faction is strong,</l>
            <l>Time for us all to pick out a good tune,</l>
            <l>Take to the roads and go marching along.</l>
            <l>March, march — How does it run? — </l>
            <l>O any old words to a tune.</l>
            <l>`Who'd care to dig 'em,' said the old, old man,</l>
            <l>'Those six feet marked in chalk?</l>
            <l>Much I talk, more I walk;</l>
            <l>Time I were buried,' said the old, old man.</l>
            <l>Soldiers take pride in saluting their Captain,</l>
            <l>Where are the captains that govern mankind?</l>
            <l>What happens a tree that has nothing within it?</l>
            <l>O marching wind, O a blast of the wind.</l>
            <l>Marching, marching along.</l>
            <l>March, march, lift up the song:</l>
            <l>`Who'd care to dig 'em,' said the old, old man.</l>
            <l>`Those six feet marked in chalk?</l>
            <l>Much I talk, more I walk;</l>
            <l>Time I were buried,' said the old, old man.</l>
            <l>ALTERNATIVE SONG FOR THE SEVERED HEAD</l>
            <l>IN `THE KING OF THE GREAT CLOCK TOWER'</l>
            <l>SADDLE and ride, I heard a man say,</l>
            <l>Out of Ben Bulben and Knocknarea,</l>
            <l>What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?</l>
            <l>All those tragic characters ride</l>
            <l>But turn from Rosses' crawling tide,</l>
            <l>The meet's upon the mountain-side.</l>
            <l>A slow low note and an iron bell.</l>
            <l>What brought them there so far from their home.</l>
            <l>Cuchulain that fought night long with the foam,</l>
            <l>What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?</l>
            <l>Niamh that rode on it; lad and lass</l>
            <l>That sat so still and played at the chess?</l>
            <l>What but heroic wantonness?</l>
            <l>A slow low note and an iron bell.</l>
            <l>Aleel, his Countess; Hanrahan</l>
            <l>That seemed but a wild wenching man;</l>
            <l>What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?</l>
            <l>And all alone comes riding there</l>
            <l>The King that could make his people stare,</l>
            <l>Because he had feathers instead of hair.</l>
            <l>A slow low note and an iron bell.</l>
            <l>TWO SONGS REWRITTEN FOR THE TUNE'S SAKE</l>
            <l>I</l>
            <l>My Paistin Finn is my sole desire,</l>
            <l>And I am shrunken to skin and bone,</l>
            <l>For all my heart has had for its hire</l>
            <l>Is what I can whistle alone and alone.</l>
            <l>Oro, oro.!</l>
            <l>Tomorrow night I will break down the door.</l>
            <l>What is the good of a man and he</l>
            <l>Alone and alone, with a speckled shin?</l>
            <l>I would that I drank with my love on my knee</l>
            <l>Between two barrels at the inn.</l>
            <l>Oro, oro.!</l>
            <l>To-morrow night I will break down the door.</l>
            <l>Alone and alone nine nights I lay</l>
            <l>Between two bushes under the rain;</l>
            <l>I thought to have whistled her down that</l>
            <l>I whistled and whistled and whistled in vain.</l>
            <l>Oro, oro!</l>
            <l>To-morrow night I will break down the door.</l>
            <l>II</l>
            <l>I would that I were an old beggar</l>
            <l>Rolling a blind pearl eye,</l>
            <l>For he cannot see my lady</l>
            <l>Go gallivanting by;</l>
            <l>A dreary, dreepy beggar</l>
            <l>Without a friend on the earth</l>
            <l>But a thieving rascally cur — </l>
            <l>O a beggar blind from his birth;</l>
            <l>Or anything else but a rhymer</l>
            <l>Without a thing in his head</l>
            <l>But rhymes for a beautiful lady,</l>
            <l>He rhyming alone in his bed.</l>
            <l>A PRAYER FOR OLD AGE</l>
            <l>GOD guard me from those thoughts men think</l>
            <l>In the mind alone;</l>
            <l>He that sings a lasting song</l>
            <l>Thinks in a marrow-bone ;</l>
            <l>From all that makes a wise old man</l>
            <l>That can be praised of all;</l>
            <l>O what am I that I should not seem</l>
            <l>For the song's sake a fool?</l>
            <l>I pray — for word is out</l>
            <l>And prayer comes round again — </l>
            <l>That I may seem, though I die old,</l>
            <l>A foolish, passionate man.</l>
            <l>CHURCH AND STATE</l>
            <l>HERE is fresh matter, poet,</l>
            <l>Matter for old age meet;</l>
            <l>Might of the Church and the State,</l>
            <l>Their mobs put under their feet.</l>
            <l>O but heart's wine shall run pure,</l>
            <l>Mind's bread grow sweet.</l>
            <l>That were a cowardly song,</l>
            <l>Wander in dreams no more;</l>
            <l>What if the Church and the State</l>
            <l>Are the mob that howls at the door!</l>
            <l>Wine shall run thick to the end,</l>
            <l>Bread taste sour.</l>
            <l>SUPERNATURAL SONGS</l>
            <l>I</l>
            <l>Ribh at the Tomb of Baile and Aillinn</l>
            <l>BECAUSE you have found me in the pitch-dark night</l>
            <l>With open book you ask me what I do.</l>
            <l>Mark and digest my tale, carry it afar</l>
            <l>To those that never saw this tonsured head</l>
            <l>Nor heard this voice that ninety years have cracked.</l>
            <l>Of Baile and Aillinn you need not speak,</l>
            <l>All know their tale, all know what leaf and twig,</l>
            <l>What juncture of the apple and the yew,</l>
            <l>Surmount their bones; but speak what none have</l>
            <l>heard.</l>
            <l>The miracle that gave them such a death</l>
            <l>Transfigured to pure substance what had once</l>
            <l>Been bone and sinew; when such bodies join</l>
            <l>There is no touching here, nor touching there,</l>
            <l>Nor straining joy, but whole is joined to whole;</l>
            <l>For the intercourse of angels is a light</l>
            <l>Where for its moment both seem lost, consumed.</l>
            <l>Here in the pitch-dark atmosphere above</l>
            <l>The trembling of the apple and the yew,</l>
            <l>Here on the anniversary of their death,</l>
            <l>The anniversary of their first embrace,</l>
            <l>Those lovers, purified by tragedy,</l>
            <l>Hurry into each other's arms; these eyes,</l>
            <l>By water, herb and solitary prayer</l>
            <l>Made aquiline, are open to that light.</l>
            <l>Though somewhat broken by the leaves, that light</l>
            <l>Lies in a circle on the grass; therein</l>
            <l>I turn the pages of my holy book.</l>
            <l>II</l>
            <l>Ribh denounces Patrick</l>
            <l>An abstract Greek absurdity has crazed the man — </l>
            <l>Recall that masculine Trinity. Man, woman, child (a</l>
            <l>daughter or a son),</l>
            <l>That's how all natural or supernatural stories run.</l>
            <l>Natural and supernatural with the self-same ring are</l>
            <l>wed.</l>
            <l>As man, as beast, as an ephemeral fly begets, Godhead</l>
            <l>begets Godhead,</l>
            <l>For things below are copies, the Great Smaragdine</l>
            <l>Tablet said.</l>
            <l>Yet all must copy copies, all increase their kind;</l>
            <l>When the conflagration of their passion sinks, damped</l>
            <l>by the body or the mind,</l>
            <l>That juggling nature mounts, her coil in their em-</l>
            <l>braces twined.</l>
            <l>The mirror-scaled serpent is multiplicity,</l>
            <l>But all that run in couples, on earth, in flood or air,</l>
            <l>share God that is but three,</l>
            <l>And could beget or bear themselves could they but</l>
            <l>love as He.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>Ribh in Ecstasy</l>
            <l>What matter that you understood no word!</l>
            <l>Doubtless I spoke or sang what I had heard</l>
            <l>In broken sentences. My soul had found</l>
            <l>All happiness in its own cause or ground.</l>
            <l>Godhead on Godhead in sexual spasm begot</l>
            <l>Godhead. Some shadow fell. My soul forgot</l>
            <l>Those amorous cries that out of quiet come</l>
            <l>And must the common round of day resume.</l>
            <l>IV</l>
            <l>There</l>
            <l>There all the barrel-hoops are knit,</l>
            <l>There all the serpent-tails are bit,</l>
            <l>There all the gyres converge in one,</l>
            <l>There all the planets drop in the Sun.</l>
            <l>V</l>
            <l>Ribh considers Christian Love insufficient</l>
            <l>Why should I seek for love or study it?</l>
            <l>It is of God and passes human wit.</l>
            <l>I study hatred with great diligence,</l>
            <l>For that's a passion in my own control,</l>
            <l>A sort of besom that can clear the soul</l>
            <l>Of everything that is not mind or sense.</l>
            <l>Why do I hate man, woman Or event?</l>
            <l>That is a light my jealous soul has sent.</l>
            <l>From terror and deception freed it can</l>
            <l>Discover impurities, can show at last</l>
            <l>How soul may walk when all such things are past,</l>
            <l>How soul could walk before such things began.</l>
            <l>Then my delivered soul herself shall learn</l>
            <l>A darker knowledge and in hatred turn</l>
            <l>From every thought of God mankind has had.</l>
            <l>Thought is a garment and the soul's a bride</l>
            <l>That cannot in that trash and tinsel hide:</l>
            <l>Hatred of God may bring the soul to God.</l>
            <l>At stroke of midnight soul cannot endure</l>
            <l>A bodily or mental furniture.</l>
            <l>What can she take until her Master give!</l>
            <l>Where can she look until He make the show!</l>
            <l>What can she know until He bid her know!</l>
            <l>How can she live till in her blood He live!</l>
            <l>VI</l>
            <l>He and She</l>
            <l>As the moon sidles up</l>
            <l>Must she sidle up,</l>
            <l>As trips the scared moon</l>
            <l>Away must she trip:</l>
            <l>`His light had struck me blind</l>
            <l>Dared I stop'.</l>
            <l>She sings as the moon sings:</l>
            <l>`I am I, am I;</l>
            <l>The greater grows my light</l>
            <l>The further that I fly'.</l>
            <l>All creation shivers</l>
            <l>With that sweet cry</l>
            <l>VII</l>
            <l>What Magic Drum?</l>
            <l>He holds him from desire, all but stops his breathing</l>
            <l>lest</l>
            <l>primordial Motherhood forsake his limbs, the child no</l>
            <l>longer rest,</l>
            <l>Drinking joy as it were milk upon his breast.</l>
            <l>Through light-obliterating garden foliage what magic</l>
            <l>drum?</l>
            <l>Down limb and breast or down that glimmering belly</l>
            <l>move his mouth and sinewy tongue.</l>
            <l>What from the forest came? What beast has licked its</l>
            <l>young?</l>
            <l>VIII</l>
            <l>Whence had they come?</l>
            <l>Eternity is passion, girl or boy</l>
            <l>Cry at the onset of their sexual joy</l>
            <l>`For ever and for ever'; then awake</l>
            <l>Ignorant what Dramatis personae spake;</l>
            <l>A passion-driven exultant man sings out</l>
            <l>Sentences that he has never thought;</l>
            <l>The Flagellant lashes those submissive loins</l>
            <l>Ignorant what that dramatist enjoins,</l>
            <l>What master made the lash. Whence had they come,</l>
            <l>The hand and lash that beat down frigid Rome?</l>
            <l>What sacred drama through her body heaved</l>
            <l>When world-transforming Charlemagne was conceived?</l>
            <l>IX</l>
            <l>The Four Ages of Man</l>
            <l>He with body waged a fight,</l>
            <l>But body won; it walks upright.</l>
            <l>Then he struggled with the heart;</l>
            <l>Innocence and peace depart.</l>
            <l>Then he struggled with the mind;</l>
            <l>His proud heart he left behind.</l>
            <l>Now his wars on God begin;</l>
            <l>At stroke of midnight God shall win.</l>
            <l>X</l>
            <l>Conjunctions</l>
            <l>If Jupiter and Saturn meet,</l>
            <l>What a cop of mummy wheat!</l>
            <l>The sword's a cross; thereon He died:</l>
            <l>On breast of Mars the goddess sighed.</l>
            <l>XI</l>
            <l>A Needle's Eye</l>
            <l>All the stream that's roaring by</l>
            <l>Came out of a needle's eye;</l>
            <l>Things unborn, things that are gone,</l>
            <l>From needle's eye still goad it on.</l>
            <l>XII</l>
            <l>Meru</l>
            <l>Civilisation is hooped together, brought</l>
            <l>Under a rule, under the semblance of peace</l>
            <l>By manifold illusion ; but man's life is thought,</l>
            <l>And he, despite his terror, cannot cease</l>
            <l>Ravening through century after century,</l>
            <l>Ravening, raging, and uprooting that he may come</l>
            <l>Into the desolation of reality:</l>
            <l>Egypt and Greece, good-bye, and good-bye, Rome!</l>
            <l>Hermits upon Mount Meru or Everest,</l>
            <l>Caverned in night under the drifted snow,</l>
            <l>Or where that snow and winter's dreadful blast</l>
            <l>Beat down upon their naked bodies, know</l>
            <l>That day brings round the night, that before dawn</l>
            <l>His glory and his monuments are gone.</l>

            <l>1936-1939</l>
            <l>THE GYRES</l>
            <l>THE GYRES! the gyres! Old Rocky Face, look forth;</l>
            <l>Things thought too long can be no longer thought,</l>
            <l>For beauty dies of beauty, worth of worth,</l>
            <l>And ancient lineaments are blotted out.</l>
            <l>Irrational streams of blood are staining earth;</l>
            <l>Empedocles has thrown all things about;</l>
            <l>Hector is dead and there's a light in Troy;</l>
            <l>We that look on but laugh in tragic joy.</l>
            <l>What matter though numb nightmare ride on top,</l>
            <l>And blood and mire the sensitive body stain?</l>
            <l>What matter? Heave no sigh, let no tear drop,</l>
            <l>A-greater, a more gracious time has gone;</l>
            <l>For painted forms or boxes of make-up</l>
            <l>In ancient tombs I sighed, but not again;</l>
            <l>What matter? Out of cavern comes a voice,</l>
            <l>And all it knows is that one word "Rejoice!'</l>
            <l>Conduct and work grow coarse, and coarse the soul,</l>
            <l>What matter? Those that Rocky Face holds dear,</l>
            <l>Lovers of horses and of women, shall,</l>
            <l>From marble of a broken sepulchre,</l>
            <l>Or dark betwixt the polecat and the owl,</l>
            <l>Or any rich, dark nothing disinter</l>
            <l>The workman, noble and saint, and all things run</l>
            <l>On that unfashionable gyre again.</l>
            <l>LAPIS LAZULI</l>
            <l>(For Harry Clifton)</l>
            <l>I HAVE heard that hysterical women say</l>
            <l>They are sick of the palette and fiddle-bow.</l>
            <l>Of poets that are always gay,</l>
            <l>For everybody knows or else should know</l>
            <l>That if nothing drastic is done</l>
            <l>Aeroplane and Zeppelin will come out.</l>
            <l>Pitch like King Billy bomb-balls in</l>
            <l>Until the town lie bearen flat.</l>
            <l>All perform their tragic play,</l>
            <l>There strutS Hamlet, there is Lear,</l>
            <l>That's Ophelia, that Cordelia;</l>
            <l>Yet they, should the last scene be there,</l>
            <l>The great stage curtain about to drop,</l>
            <l>If worthy their prominent part in the play,</l>
            <l>Do not break up their lines to weep.</l>
            <l>They know that Hamlet and Lear are gay;</l>
            <l>Gaiety transfiguring all that dread.</l>
            <l>All men have aimed at, found and lost;</l>
            <l>Black out; Heaven blazing into the head:</l>
            <l>Tragedy wrought to its uttermost.</l>
            <l>Though Hamlet rambles and Lear rages,</l>
            <l>And all the drop-scenes drop at once</l>
            <l>Upon a hundred thousand stages,</l>
            <l>It cannot grow by an inch or an ounce.</l>
            <l>On their own feet they came, or On shipboard,'</l>
            <l>Camel-back; horse-back, ass-back, mule-back,</l>
            <l>Old civilisations put to the sword.</l>
            <l>Then they and their wisdom went to rack:</l>
            <l>No handiwork of Callimachus,</l>
            <l>Who handled marble as if it were bronze,</l>
            <l>Made draperies that seemed to rise</l>
            <l>When sea-wind swept the corner, stands;</l>
            <l>His long lamp-chimney shaped like the stem</l>
            <l>Of a slender palm, stood but a day;</l>
            <l>All things fall and are built again,</l>
            <l>And those that build them again are gay.</l>
            <l>Two Chinamen, behind them a third,</l>
            <l>Are carved in lapis lazuli,</l>
            <l>Over them flies a long-legged bird,</l>
            <l>A symbol of longevity;</l>
            <l>The third, doubtless a serving-man,</l>
            <l>Carries a musical instmment.</l>
            <l>Every discoloration of the stone,</l>
            <l>Every accidental crack or dent,</l>
            <l>Seems a water-course or an avalanche,</l>
            <l>Or lofty slope where it still snows</l>
            <l>Though doubtless plum or cherry-branch</l>
            <l>Sweetens the little half-way house</l>
            <l>Those Chinamen climb towards, and I</l>
            <l>Delight to imagine them seated there;</l>
            <l>There, on the mountain and the sky,</l>
            <l>On all the tragic scene they stare.</l>
            <l>One asks for mournful melodies;</l>
            <l>Accomplished fingers begin to play.</l>
            <l>Their eyes mid many wrinkles, their eyes,</l>
            <l>Their ancient, glittering eyes, are gay.</l>
            <l>IMITATED FROM THE JAPANESE</l>
            <l>A MOST astonishing thing — </l>
            <l>Seventy years have I lived;</l>
            <l>(Hurrah for the flowers of Spring,</l>
            <l>For Spring is here again.)</l>
            <l>Seventy years have I lived</l>
            <l>No ragged beggar-man,</l>
            <l>Seventy years have I lived,</l>
            <l>Seventy years man and boy,</l>
            <l>And never have I danced for joy.</l>
            <l>SWEET DANCER</l>
            <l>THE girl goes dancing there</l>
            <l>On the leaf-sown, new-mown, smooth</l>
            <l>Grass plot of the garden;</l>
            <l>Escaped from bitter youth,</l>
            <l>Escaped out of her crowd,</l>
            <l>Or out of her black cloud.</l>
            <l>Ah, dancer, ah, sweet dancer.!</l>
            <l>If strange men come from the house</l>
            <l>To lead her away, do not say</l>
            <l>That she is happy being crazy;</l>
            <l>Lead them gently astray;</l>
            <l>Let her finish her dance,</l>
            <l>Let her finish her dance.</l>
            <l>Ah, dancer, ah, sweet dancer.!</l>
            <l>THE THREE BUSHES</l>
            <l>SAID lady once to lover,</l>
            <l>"None can rely upon</l>
            <l>A love that lacks its proper food;</l>
            <l>And if your love were gone</l>
            <l>How could you sing those songs of love?</l>
            <l>I should be blamed, young man.</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>Have no lit candles in your room,'</l>
            <l>That lovely lady said,</l>
            <l>"That I at midnight by the clock</l>
            <l>May creep into your bed,</l>
            <l>For if I saw myself creep in</l>
            <l>I think I should drop dead.'</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>"I love a man in secret,</l>
            <l>Dear chambermaid,' said she.</l>
            <l>"I know that I must drop down dead</l>
            <l>If he stop loving me,</l>
            <l>Yet what could I but drop down dead</l>
            <l>If I lost my chastity?</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>"So you must lie beside him</l>
            <l>And let him think me there.</l>
            <l>And maybe we are all the same</l>
            <l>Where no candles are,</l>
            <l>And maybe we are all the same</l>
            <l>That stip the body bare.'</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>But no dogs barked, and midnights chimed,</l>
            <l>And through the chime she'd say,</l>
            <l>"That was a lucky thought of mine,</l>
            <l>My lover. looked so gay';</l>
            <l>But heaved a sigh if the chambermaid</l>
            <l>Looked half asleep all day.</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>"No, not another song,' siid he,</l>
            <l>"Because my lady came</l>
            <l>A year ago for the first time</l>
            <l>At midnight to my room,</l>
            <l>And I must lie between the sheets</l>
            <l>When the clock begins to chime.'</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my d-ear.</l>
            <l>"A laughing, crying, sacred song,</l>
            <l>A leching song,' they said.</l>
            <l>Did ever men hear such a song?</l>
            <l>No, but that day they did.</l>
            <l>Did ever man ride such a race?</l>
            <l>No, not until he rode.</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>But when his horse had put its hoof</l>
            <l>Into a rabbit-hole</l>
            <l>He dropped upon his head and died.</l>
            <l>His lady saw it all</l>
            <l>And dropped and died thereon, for she</l>
            <l>Loved him with her soul.</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>The chambermaid lived long, and took</l>
            <l>Their graves into her charge,</l>
            <l>And there two bushes planted</l>
            <l>That when they had grown large</l>
            <l>Seemed sprung from but a single root</l>
            <l>So did their roses merge.</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>When she was old and dying,</l>
            <l>The priest came where she was;</l>
            <l>She made a full confession.</l>
            <l>Long looked he in her face,</l>
            <l>And O he was a good man</l>
            <l>And understood her case.</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>He bade them take and bury her</l>
            <l>Beside her lady's man,</l>
            <l>And set a rose-tree on her grave,</l>
            <l>And now none living can,</l>
            <l>When they have plucked a rose there,</l>
            <l>Know where its roots began.</l>
            <l>O my dear, O my dear.</l>
            <l>THE LADY'S FIRST SONG</l>
            <l>I TURN round</l>
            <l>Like a dumb beast in a show.</l>
            <l>Neither know what I am</l>
            <l>Nor where I go,</l>
            <l>My language beaten</l>
            <l>Into one name;</l>
            <l>I am in love</l>
            <l>And that is my shame.</l>
            <l>What hurts the soul</l>
            <l>My soul adores,</l>
            <l>No better than a beast</l>
            <l>Upon all fours.</l>
            <l>THE LADY'S SECOND SONG</l>
            <l>WHAT sort of man is coming</l>
            <l>To lie between your feet?</l>
            <l>What matter, we are but women.</l>
            <l>Wash; make your body sweet;</l>
            <l>I have cupboards of dried fragrance.</l>
            <l>I can strew the sheet.</l>
            <l>The Lord have mercy upon us.</l>
            <l>He shall love my soul as though</l>
            <l>Body were not at all,</l>
            <l>He shall love your body</l>
            <l>Untroubled by the soul,</l>
            <l>Love cram love's two divisions</l>
            <l>Yet keep his substance whole.</l>
            <l>The Lord have mercy upon us.</l>
            <l>Soul must learn a love that is</l>
            <l>proper to my breast,</l>
            <l>Limbs a Love in common</l>
            <l>With every noble beast.</l>
            <l>If soul may look and body touch,</l>
            <l>Which is the more blest?</l>
            <l>The Lord have mercy upon us.</l>
            <l>THE LADY'S THIRD SONG</l>
            <l>WHEN you and my true lover meet</l>
            <l>And he plays tunes between your feet.</l>
            <l>Speak no evil of the soul,</l>
            <l>Nor think that body is the whole,</l>
            <l>For I that am his daylight lady</l>
            <l>Know worse evil of the body;</l>
            <l>But in honour split his love</l>
            <l>Till either neither have enough,</l>
            <l>That I may hear if we should kiss</l>
            <l>A contrapuntal serpent hiss,</l>
            <l>You, should hand explore a thigh,</l>
            <l>All the labouring heavens sigh.</l>
            <l>THE LOVER'S SONG</l>
            <l>BIRD sighs for the air,</l>
            <l>Thought for I know not where,</l>
            <l>For the womb the seed sighs.</l>
            <l>Now sinks the same rest</l>
            <l>On mind, on nest,</l>
            <l>On straining thighs.</l>
            <l>THE CHAMBERMAID'S FIRST SONG</l>
            <l>HOW came this ranger</l>
            <l>Now sunk in rest,</l>
            <l>Stranger with strangcr.</l>
            <l>On my cold breast?</l>
            <l>What's left to Sigh for?</l>
            <l>Strange night has come;</l>
            <l>God's love has hidden him</l>
            <l>Out of all harm,</l>
            <l>Pleasure has made him</l>
            <l>Weak as a worm.</l>
            <l>THE CHAMBERMAID'S SECOND SONG</l>
            <l>FROM pleasure of the bed,</l>
            <l>Dull as a worm,</l>
            <l>His rod and its butting head</l>
            <l>Limp as a worm,</l>
            <l>His spirit that has fled</l>
            <l>Blind as a worm.</l>
            <l>AN ACRE OF GRASS</l>
            <l>PICTURE and book remain,</l>
            <l>An acre of green grass</l>
            <l>For air and exercise,</l>
            <l>Now strength of body goes;</l>
            <l>Midnight, an old house</l>
            <l>Where nothing stirs but a mouse.</l>
            <l>My temptation is quiet.</l>
            <l>Here at life's end</l>
            <l>Neither loose imagination,</l>
            <l>Nor the mill of the mind</l>
            <l>Consuming its rag and bonc,</l>
            <l>Can make the truth known.</l>
            <l>Grant me an old man's frenzy,</l>
            <l>Myself must I remake</l>
            <l>Till I am Timon and Lear</l>
            <l>Or that William Blake</l>
            <l>Who beat upon the wall</l>
            <l>Till Truth obeyed his call;</l>
            <l>A mind Michael Angelo knew</l>
            <l>That can pierce the clouds,</l>
            <l>Or inspired by frenzy</l>
            <l>Shake the dead in their shrouds;</l>
            <l>Forgotten else by mankind,</l>
            <l>An old man's eagle mind.</l>
            <l>WHAT THEN?</l>
            <l>HIS chosen comrades thought at school</l>
            <l>He must grow a famous man;</l>
            <l>He thought the same and lived by rule,</l>
            <l>All his twenties crammed with toil;</l>
            <l>"What then?' sang Plato's ghost. "What then?"</l>
            <l>Everything he wrote was read,</l>
            <l>After certain years he won</l>
            <l>Sufficient money for his need,</l>
            <l>Friends that have been friends indeed;</l>
            <l>"What then?' sang Plato's ghost. " What then?'</l>
            <l>All his happier dreams came true — </l>
            <l>A small old house, wife, daughter, son,</l>
            <l>Grounds where plum and cabbage grew,</l>
            <l>poets and Wits about him drew;</l>
            <l>"What then.?' sang Plato's ghost. "What then?'</l>
            <l>The work is done,' grown old he thought,</l>
            <l>"According to my boyish plan;</l>
            <l>Let the fools rage, I swerved in naught,</l>
            <l>Something to perfection brought';</l>
            <l>But louder sang that ghost, "What then?'</l>
            <l>BEAUTIFUL LOFTY THlNGS</l>
            <l>BEAUTIFUL lofty things: O'Leary's noble head;</l>
            <l>My father upon the Abbey stage, before him a raging</l>

            <l>"This Land of Saints,' and then as the applause died</l>
            <l>out,</l>
            <l>"Of plaster Saints'; his beautiful mischievous head</l>
            <l>thrown back.</l>
            <l>Standish O'Grady supporting himself between the</l>

            <l>I told him that nightly from six to seven I sat at this</l>
            <l>table,</l>
            <l>The blinds drawn up'; Maud Gonne at Howth station</l>
            <l>waiting a train,</l>
            <l>Pallas Athene in that straight back and arrogant head:</l>
            <l>All the Olympians; a thing never known again.</l>

            <l>THAT crazed girl improvising her music.</l>
            <l>Her poetry, dancing upon the shore,</l>

            <l>STRETCH towards the moonless midnight of the trees,</l>
            <l>As though that hand could reach to where they stand,</l>
            <l>And they but famous old upholsteries</l>
            <l>Delightful to the touch; tighten that hand</l>

            <l>Rammed full</l>

            <l>Climb to your chamber full of books and wait,</l>

            <l>What climbs the stair?</l>
            <l>Nothing that common women ponder on</l>
            <l>If you are worrh my hope! Neither Content</l>
            <l>Nor satisfied Conscience, but that great family</l>
            <l>Some ancient famous authors mistepresent,</l>
            <l>The proud Furies each with her torch on high.</l>
            <l>THE CURSE OF CROMWELL</l>
            <l>YOU ask what — I have found, and far and wide I go:</l>
            <l>Nothing but Cromwell's house and Cromwell's mur-</l>
            <l>derous crew,</l>
            <l>The lovers and the dancers are beaten into the clay,</l>
            <l>And the tall men and the swordsmen and the horsemen,</l>
            <l>where are they?</l>
            <l>And there is an old beggar wandering in his pride — -</l>
            <l>His fathers served their fathers before Christ was</l>
            <l>crucified.</l>
            <l>O what of that, O what of that,</l>
            <l>"What is there left to say?</l>
            <l>All neighbourly content and easy talk are gone,</l>
            <l>But there's no good complaining, for money's rant is</l>
            <l>on.</l>
            <l>He that's mounting up must on his neighbour mount,</l>
            <l>And we and all the Muses are things of no account.</l>
            <l>They have schooling of their own, but I pass their</l>

            <l>But there's another knowledge that my heart destroys,</l>
            <l>As the fox in the old fable destroyed the Spartan boy's</l>
            <l>Because it proves that things both can and cannot be;</l>

            <l>I came on a great house in the middle of the night,</l>
            <l>Its open lighted doorway and its windows all alight,</l>
            <l>And all my friends were there and made me welcome</l>
            <l>too;</l>
            <l>But I woke in an old ruin that the winds. howled</l>
            <l>through;</l>
            <l>And when I pay attention I must out and walk</l>
            <l>Among the dogs and horses that understand my talk.</l>
            <l>O what of that, O what of that,</l>
            <l>What is there left to say?</l>
            <l>ROGER CASEMENT</l>
            <l>I SAY that Roger Casement</l>
            <l>Did what he had to do.</l>
            <l>He died upon the gallows,</l>
            <l>But that is nothing new.</l>
            <l>Afraid they might be beaten</l>
            <l>Before the bench of Time,</l>
            <l>They turned a trick by forgery</l>
            <l>And blackened his good name.</l>
            <l>A perjurer stood ready</l>
            <l>To prove their forgery true;</l>
            <l>They gave it out to all the world,</l>
            <l>And that is something new;</l>
            <l>For Spring Rice had to whisper it,</l>
            <l>Being their Ambassador,</l>
            <l>And then the speakers got it</l>
            <l>And writers by the score.</l>
            <l>Come Tom and Dick, come all the troop</l>
            <l>That cried it far and wide,</l>
            <l>Come from the forger and his desk,</l>
            <l>Desert the perjurer's side;</l>
            <l>Come speak your bit in public</l>
            <l>That some amends be made</l>
            <l>To this most gallant gentleman</l>
            <l>That is in quicklime laid.</l>
            <l>THE GHOST OF ROGER CASEMENT</l>
            <l>O WHAT has made that sudden noise?</l>
            <l>What on the threshold stands?</l>
            <l>It never crossed the sea because</l>
            <l>John Bull and the sea are friends;</l>
            <l>But this is not the old sea</l>
            <l>Nor this the old seashore.</l>
            <l>What gave that roar of mockery,</l>
            <l>That roar in the sea's roar?</l>
            <l>The ghost of Roger Casement</l>
            <l>Is beating on the door.</l>
            <l>John Bull has stood for Parliament,</l>
            <l>A dog must have his day,</l>
            <l>The country thinks no end of him,</l>
            <l>For he knows how to say,</l>
            <l>At a beanfeast or a banquet,</l>
            <l>That all must hang their trust</l>
            <l>Upon the British Empire,</l>
            <l>Upon the Church of Christ.</l>
            <l>The ghost of Roger Casement</l>
            <l>Is beating on the door.</l>
            <l>John Bull has gone to India</l>
            <l>And all must pay him heed,</l>
            <l>For histories are there to prove</l>
            <l>That none of another breed</l>
            <l>Has had a like inheritance,</l>
            <l>Or sucked such milk as he,</l>
            <l>And there's no luck about a house</l>
            <l>If it lack honesty.</l>
            <l>The ghost of Roger Casement</l>
            <l>Is beating on the door.</l>
            <l>I poked about a village church</l>
            <l>And found his family tomb</l>
            <l>And copied out what I could read</l>
            <l>In that religious gloom;</l>
            <l>Found many a famous man there;</l>
            <l>But fame and virtue rot.</l>
            <l>Draw round, beloved and bitter men,</l>
            <l>Draw round and raise a shout;</l>
            <l>The ghost of Roger Casement</l>
            <l>Is beating on the door.</l>
            <l>THE O'RAHILLY</l>
            <l>SING of the O'Rahilly,</l>
            <l>Do not deny his right;</l>
            <l>Sing a "the' before his name;</l>
            <l>Allow that he, despite</l>
            <l>All those learned historians,</l>
            <l>Established it for good;</l>
            <l>He wrote out that word himself,</l>
            <l>He christened himself with blood.</l>
            <l>How goes the weather?</l>
            <l>Sing of the O'Rahilly</l>
            <l>That had such little sense</l>
            <l>He told Pearse and Connolly</l>
            <l>He'd gone to great expense</l>
            <l>Keeping all the Kerry men</l>
            <l>Out of that crazy fight;</l>
            <l>That he might be there himself</l>
            <l>Had travelled half the night.</l>
            <l>How goes the weather?</l>
            <l>"Am I such a craven that</l>
            <l>I should not get the word</l>
            <l>But for what some travelling man</l>
            <l>Had heard I had not heard?'</l>
            <l>Then on pearse and Connolly</l>
            <l>He fixed a bitter look:</l>
            <l>"Because I helped to wind the clock</l>
            <l>I come to hear it strike.'</l>
            <l>How goes the weather?</l>
            <l>What remains to sing about</l>
            <l>But of the death he met</l>
            <l>Stretched under a doorway</l>
            <l>Somewhere off Henry Street;</l>
            <l>They that found him found upon</l>
            <l>The door above his head</l>
            <l>"Here died the O'Rahilly.</l>
            <l>R.I.P.' writ in blood.</l>
            <l>How goes the weather.?</l>
            <l>COME GATHER ROUND ME, PARNELLITES</l>
            <l>COME gather round me, Parnellites,</l>
            <l>And praise our chosen man;</l>
            <l>Stand upright on your legs awhile,</l>
            <l>Stand upright while you can,</l>
            <l>For soon we lie where he is laid,</l>
            <l>And he is underground;</l>
            <l>Come fill up all those glasses</l>
            <l>And pass the bottle round.</l>
            <l>And here's a cogent reason,</l>
            <l>And I have many more,</l>
            <l>He fought the might of England</l>
            <l>And saved the Irish poor,</l>
            <l>Whatever good a farmer's got</l>
            <l>He brought it all to pass;</l>
            <l>And here's another reason,</l>
            <l>That parnell loved a lass.</l>
            <l>And here's a final reason,</l>
            <l>He was of such a kind</l>
            <l>Every man that sings a song</l>
            <l>Keeps Parnell in his mind.</l>
            <l>For Parnell was a proud man,</l>
            <l>No prouder trod the ground,</l>
            <l>And a proud man's a lovely man,</l>
            <l>So pass the bottle round.</l>
            <l>The Bishops and the party</l>
            <l>That tragic story made,</l>
            <l>A husband that had sold hiS wife</l>
            <l>And after that betrayed;</l>
            <l>But stories that live longest</l>
            <l>Are sung above the glass,</l>
            <l>And Parnell loved his countrey</l>
            <l>And parnell loved his lass.</l>
            <l>THE WILD OLD WICKED MAN</l>
            <l>BECAUSE I am mad about women</l>
            <l>I am mad about the hills,'</l>
            <l>Said that wild old wicked man</l>
            <l>Who travels where God wills.</l>
            <l>"Not to die on the straw at home.</l>
            <l>Those hands to close these eyes,</l>
            <l>That is all I ask, my dear,</l>
            <l>From the old man in the skies.</l>
            <l>Daybreak and a candle-end.</l>
            <l>"Kind are all your words, my dear,</l>
            <l>Do not the rest withhold.</l>
            <l>Who can know the year, my dear,</l>
            <l>when an old man's blood grows cold? '</l>
            <l>I have what no young man can have</l>
            <l>Because he loves too much.</l>
            <l>Words I have that can pierce the heart,</l>
            <l>But what can he do but touch?'</l>
            <l>Daybreak and a candle-end.</l>
            <l>Then Said she to that wild old man,</l>
            <l>His stout stick under his hand,</l>
            <l>"Love to give or to withhold</l>
            <l>Is not at my command.</l>
            <l>I gave it all to an older man:</l>
            <l>That old man in the skies.</l>
            <l>Hands that are busy with His beads</l>
            <l>Can never close those eyes.'</l>
            <l>Daybreak and a candle-end.</l>
            <l>"Go your ways, O go your ways,</l>
            <l>I choose another mark,</l>
            <l>Girls down on the seashore</l>
            <l>Who understand the dark;</l>
            <l>Bawdy talk for the fishermen;</l>
            <l>A dance for the fisher-lads;</l>
            <l>When dark hangs upon the water</l>
            <l>They turn down their beds.</l>
            <l>Daybreak and a candle-end.</l>
            <l>"A young man in the dark am I,</l>
            <l>But a wild old man in the light,</l>
            <l>That can make a cat laugh, or</l>
            <l>Can touch by mother wit</l>
            <l>Things hid in their marrow-bones</l>
            <l>From time long passed away,</l>
            <l>Hid from all those warty lads</l>
            <l>That by their bodies lay.</l>
            <l>Dayhreak and a candle-end.</l>
            <l>"All men live in suffering,</l>
            <l>I know as few can know,</l>
            <l>Whether they take the upper road</l>
            <l>Or stay content on the low,</l>
            <l>Rower bent in his row-boat</l>
            <l>Or weaver bent at his loom,</l>
            <l>Horseman erect upon horseback</l>
            <l>Or child hid in the womb.</l>
            <l>Daybreak and a candlc-cnd.</l>
            <l>"That some stream of lightning</l>
            <l>From the old man in the skies</l>
            <l>Can burn out that suffering</l>
            <l>No right-taught man denies.</l>
            <l>But a coarse old man am I,</l>
            <l>I choose the second-best,</l>
            <l>I forget it all awhile</l>
            <l>Upon a woman's breast.'</l>
            <l>Daybreak and a candlc-end.</l>
            <l>THE GREAT DAY</l>
            <l>HURRAH for revolution and more cannon-shot!</l>
            <l>A beggar upon horseback lashes a beggar on foot.</l>
            <l>Hurrah for revolution and cannon come again !</l>
            <l>The beggars have changed places, but the lash goes on.</l>
            <l>PARNELL</l>
            <l>PARNELL came down the road, he said to a cheering</l>
            <l>man:</l>
            <l>"Ireland shall get her freedom and you still break</l>
            <l>stone.</l>
            <l>WHAT WAS LOST</l>
            <l>I SING what was lost and dread what was won,</l>
            <l>I walk in a battle fought over again,</l>
            <l>My king a lost king, and lost soldiers my men;</l>
            <l>Feet to the Rising and Setting may run,</l>
            <l>They always beat on the same small stone.</l>
            <l>THE SPUR</l>
            <l>YOU think it horrible that lust and rage</l>
            <l>Should dance attention upon my old age;</l>
            <l>They were not such a plague when I was young;</l>
            <l>What else have I to spur me into song?</l>
            <l>A DRUNKEN MAN'S PRAISE OF SOBRIETY</l>
            <l>COME swish around, my pretty punk,</l>
            <l>And keep me dancing still</l>
            <l>That I may stay a sober man</l>
            <l>Although I drink my fill.</l>
            <l>Sobriety is a jewel</l>
            <l>That I do much adore;</l>
            <l>And therefore keep me dancing</l>
            <l>Though drunkards lie and snore.</l>
            <l>O mind your feet, O mind your feet,</l>
            <l>Keep dancing like a wave,</l>
            <l>And under every dancer</l>
            <l>A dead man in his grave.</l>
            <l>No ups and downs, my pretty,</l>
            <l>A mermaid, not a punk;</l>
            <l>A drunkard is a dead man,</l>
            <l>And all dead men are drunk.</l>
            <l>THE PILGRIM</l>
            <l>I FASTED for some forty days on bread and buttermilk,</l>
            <l>For passing round the bottle with girls in rags or silk,</l>
            <l>In country shawl or Paris cloak, had put my wits astray,</l>
            <l>And what's the good of women, for all that they can say</l>
            <l>Is fol de rol de rolly O.</l>
            <l>Round Lough Derg's holy island I went upon the</l>
            <l>stones,</l>
            <l>I prayed at all the Stations upon my matrow-bones,</l>
            <l>And there I found an old man, and though, I prayed all</l>
            <l>day</l>
            <l>And that old man beside me, nothing would he say</l>
            <l>But fol de rol de rolly O.</l>
            <l>All know that all the dead in the world about that</l>
            <l>place are stuck,</l>
            <l>And that should mother seek her son she'd have but</l>
            <l>little luck</l>
            <l>Because the fires of purgatory have ate their shapes</l>
            <l>away;</l>
            <l>I swear to God I questioned them, and all they had to</l>
            <l>say</l>
            <l>Was fol de rol de rolly O.</l>
            <l>A great black ragged bird appeared when I was in the</l>
            <l>boat;</l>
            <l>Some twenty feet from tip to tip had it stretched</l>
            <l>rightly out,</l>
            <l>With flopping and with flapping it made a great dis-</l>
            <l>play,</l>
            <l>But I never stopped to question, what could the boat-</l>
            <l>man say</l>
            <l>But fol de rol de rolly O.</l>
            <l>Now I am in the public-house and lean upon the wall,</l>
            <l>So come in rags or come in silk, in cloak or country</l>
            <l>shawl,</l>
            <l>And come with learned lovers or with what men you</l>
            <l>may,</l>
            <l>For I can put the whole lot down, and all I have to say</l>
            <l>Is fol de rol de rolly O.</l>
            <l>COLONEL MARTIN</l>
            <l>THE Colonel went out sailing,</l>
            <l>He spoke with Turk and Jew,</l>
            <l>With Christian and with Infidel,</l>
            <l>For all tongues he knew.</l>
            <l>"O what's a wifeless man?' said he,</l>
            <l>And he came sailing home.</l>
            <l>He rose the latch and went upstairS</l>
            <l>And found an empty room.</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>"I kept her much in the country</l>
            <l>And she was much alone,</l>
            <l>And though she may be there,' he said,</l>
            <l>"She may be in the town.</l>
            <l>She may be all alone there,</l>
            <l>For who can say?' he said.</l>
            <l>"I think that I shall find her</l>
            <l>In a young man's bed.'</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>The Colonel met a pedlar,</l>
            <l>Agreed their clothes to swop,</l>
            <l>And bought the grandest jewelry</l>
            <l>In a Galway shop,</l>
            <l>Instead of thread and needle</l>
            <l>put jewelry in the pack,</l>
            <l>Bound a thong about his hand,</l>
            <l>Hitched it on his back.</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>The Colonel knocked on the rich man's door,</l>
            <l>"I am sorry,' said the maid,</l>
            <l>"My mistress cannot see these things,</l>
            <l>But she is still abed,</l>
            <l>And never have I looked upon</l>
            <l>Jewelry so grand.'</l>
            <l>"Take all to your mistress,'</l>
            <l>And he laid them on her hand.</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>And he went in and she went on</l>
            <l>And both climbed up the stair,</l>
            <l>And O he was a clever man,</l>
            <l>For he his slippers wore.</l>
            <l>And when they came to the top stair</l>
            <l>He ran on ahead,</l>
            <l>His wife he found and the rich man</l>
            <l>In the comfort of a bed.</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>The Judge at the Assize Court,</l>
            <l>When he heard that story told,</l>
            <l>Awarded him for damages</l>
            <l>Three kegs of gold.</l>
            <l>The Colonel said to Tom his man,</l>
            <l>"Harness an ass and cart,</l>
            <l>Carry the gold about the town,</l>
            <l>Throw it in every patt.'</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>VII</l>
            <l>And there at all street-corners</l>
            <l>A man with a pistol stood,</l>
            <l>And the rich man had paid them well</l>
            <l>To shoot the Colonel dead;</l>
            <l>But they threw down their pistols</l>
            <l>And all men heard them swear</l>
            <l>That they could never shoot a man</l>
            <l>Did all that for the poor.</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>VIII</l>
            <l>"And did you keep no gold, Tom?</l>
            <l>You had three kegs,' said he.</l>
            <l>"I never thought of that, Sir.'</l>
            <l>"Then want before you die.'</l>
            <l>And want he did; for my own grand-dad</l>
            <l>Saw the story's end,</l>
            <l>And Tom make out a living</l>
            <l>From the seaweed on the strand.</l>
            <l>The Colonel went out sailing.</l>
            <l>A MODEL FOR THE LAUREATE</l>
            <l>ON thrones from China to Peru</l>
            <l>All sorts of kings have sat</l>
            <l>That men and women of all sorts</l>
            <l>proclaimed both good and great;</l>
            <l>And what's the odds if such as these</l>
            <l>For reason of the State</l>
            <l>Should keep their lovers waiting,</l>
            <l>Keep their lovers waiting?</l>
            <l>Some boast of beggar-kings and kings</l>
            <l>Of rascals black and white</l>
            <l>That rule because a strong right arm</l>
            <l>Puts all men in a fright,</l>
            <l>And drunk or sober live at ease</l>
            <l>Where none gainsay their right,</l>
            <l>And keep their lovers waiting,</l>
            <l>Keep their lovers waiting.</l>
            <l>The Muse is mute when public men</l>
            <l>Applaud a modern throne:</l>
            <l>Those cheers that can be bought or sold,</l>
            <l>That office fools have run,</l>
            <l>That waxen seal, that signature.</l>
            <l>For things like these what decent man</l>
            <l>Would keep his lover waiting,</l>
            <l>Keep his lover waiting?</l>
            <l>THE OLD STONE CROSS</l>
            <l>A STATESMAN is an easy man,</l>
            <l>He tells his lies by rote;</l>
            <l>A journalist makes up his lies</l>
            <l>And takes you by the throat;</l>
            <l>So stay at home' and drink your beer</l>
            <l>And let the neighbours' vote,</l>
            <l>Said the man in the golden breastplate</l>
            <l>Under the old stone Cross.</l>
            <l>Because this age and the next age</l>
            <l>Engender in the ditch,</l>
            <l>No man can know a happy man</l>
            <l>From any passing wretch;</l>
            <l>If Folly link with Elegance</l>
            <l>No man knows which is which,</l>
            <l>Said the man in the golden breastplate</l>
            <l>Under the old stone Cross.</l>
            <l>But actors lacking music</l>
            <l>Do most excite my spleen,</l>
            <l>They say it is more human</l>
            <l>To shuffle, grunt and groan,</l>
            <l>Not knowing what unearthly stuff</l>
            <l>Rounds a mighty scene,</l>
            <l>Said the man in the golden breastplate</l>
            <l>Under the old stone Cross.</l>
            <l>THE SPIRIT MEDIUM</l>
            <l>POETRY, music, I have loved, and yet</l>
            <l>Because of those new dead</l>
            <l>That come into my soul and escape</l>
            <l>Confusion of the bed,</l>
            <l>Or those begotten or unbegotten</l>
            <l>Perning in a band,</l>
            <l>I bend my body to the spade</l>
            <l>Or grope with a dirty hand.</l>
            <l>Or those begotten or unbegotten,</l>
            <l>For I would not recall</l>
            <l>Some that being unbegotten</l>
            <l>Are not individual,</l>
            <l>But copy some one action,</l>
            <l>Moulding it of dust or sand,</l>
            <l>I bend my body to the spade</l>
            <l>Or grope with a dirty hand.</l>
            <l>An old ghost's thoughts are lightning,</l>
            <l>To follow is to die;</l>
            <l>Poetry and music I have banished,</l>
            <l>But the stupidity</l>
            <l>Of root, shoot, blossom or clay</l>
            <l>Makes no demand.</l>
            <l>I bend my body to the spade</l>
            <l>Or grope with a dirty hand.</l>
            <l>THOSE IMAGES</l>
            <l>WHAT if I bade you leave</l>
            <l>The cavern of the mind?</l>
            <l>There's better exercise</l>
            <l>In the sunlight and wind.</l>
            <l>I never bade you go</l>
            <l>To Moscow or to Rome.</l>
            <l>Renounce that drudgery,</l>
            <l>Call the Muses home.</l>
            <l>Seek those images</l>
            <l>That constitute the wild,</l>
            <l>The lion and the virgin,</l>
            <l>The harlot and the child</l>
            <l>Find in middle air</l>
            <l>An eagle on the wing,</l>
            <l>Recognise the five</l>
            <l>That make the Muses sing.</l>
            <l>THE MUNICIPAL GALLERY REVISITED</l>
            <l>AROUND me the images of thirty years:</l>
            <l>An ambush; pilgrims at the water-side;</l>
            <l>Casement upon trial, half hidden by the bars,</l>
            <l>Guarded; Griffith staring in hysterical pride;</l>
            <l>Kevin O'Higgins' countenance that wears</l>
            <l>A gentle questioning look that cannot hide</l>
            <l>A soul incapable of remorse or rest;</l>
            <l>A revolutionary soldier kneeling to be blessed;</l>
            <l>An Abbot or Archbishop with an upraised hand</l>
            <l>Blessing the Tricolour. "This is not,' I say,</l>
            <l>"The dead Ireland of my youth, but an Ireland</l>
            <l>The poets have imagined, terrible and gay.'</l>
            <l>Before a woman's portrait suddenly I stand,</l>
            <l>Beautiful and gentle in her Venetian way.</l>
            <l>I met her all but fifty years ago</l>
            <l>For twenty minutes in some studio.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>Heart-smitten with emotion I Sink down,</l>
            <l>My heart recovering with covered eyes;</l>
            <l>Wherever I had looked I had looked upon</l>
            <l>My permanent or impermanent images:</l>
            <l>Augusta Gregory's son; her sister's son,</l>
            <l>Hugh Lane, "onlie begetter' of all these;</l>
            <l>Hazel Lavery living and dying, that tale</l>
            <l>As though some ballad-singer had sung it all;</l>
            <l>Mancini's portrait of Augusta Gregory,</l>
            <l>"Greatest since Rembrandt,' according to John Synge;</l>
            <l>A great ebullient portrait certainly;</l>
            <l>But where is the brush that could show anything</l>
            <l>Of all that pride and that humility?</l>
            <l>And I am in despair that time may bring</l>
            <l>Approved patterns of women or of men</l>
            <l>But not that selfsame excellence again.</l>
            <l>My mediaeval knees lack health until they bend,</l>
            <l>But in that woman, in that household where</l>
            <l>Honour had lived so long, all lacking found.</l>
            <l>Childless I thought, "My children may find here</l>
            <l>Deep-rooted things,' but never foresaw its end,</l>
            <l>And now that end has come I have not wept;</l>
            <l>No fox can foul the lair the badger swept — </l>
            <l>VI</l>
            <l>(An image out of Spenser and the common tongue).</l>
            <l>John Synge, I and Augusta Gregory, thought</l>
            <l>All that we did, all that we said or sang</l>
            <l>Must come from contact with the soil, from that</l>
            <l>Contact everything Antaeus-like grew strong.</l>
            <l>We three alone in modern times had brought</l>
            <l>Everything down to that sole test again,</l>
            <l>Dream of the noble and the beggar-man.</l>
            <l>VII</l>
            <l>And here's John Synge himself, that rooted man,</l>
            <l>"Forgetting human words,' a grave deep face.</l>
            <l>You that would judge me, do not judge alone</l>
            <l>This book or that, come to this hallowed place</l>
            <l>Where my friends' portraits hang and look thereon;</l>
            <l>Ireland's history in their lineaments trace;</l>
            <l>Think where man's glory most begins and ends,</l>
            <l>And say my glory was I had such friends.</l>
            <l>ARE YOU CONTENT?</l>
            <l>I CALL on those that call me son,</l>
            <l>Grandson, or great-grandson,</l>
            <l>On uncles, aunts, great-uncles or great-aunts,</l>
            <l>To judge what I have done.</l>
            <l>Have I, that put it into words,</l>
            <l>Spoilt what old loins have sent?</l>
            <l>Eyes spiritualised by death can judge,</l>
            <l>I cannot, but I am not content.</l>
            <l>He that in Sligo at Drumcliff</l>
            <l>Set up the old stone Cross,</l>
            <l>That red-headed rector in County Down,</l>
            <l>A good man on a horse,</l>
            <l>Sandymount Corbets, that notable man</l>
            <l>Old William pollexfen,</l>
            <l>The smuggler Middleton, Butlers far back,</l>
            <l>Half legendary men.</l>
            <l>Infirm and aged I might stay</l>
            <l>In some good company,</l>
            <l>I who have always hated work,</l>
            <l>Smiling at the sea,</l>
            <l>Or demonstrate in my own life</l>
            <l>What Robert Browning meant</l>
            <l>By an old hunter talking with Gods;</l>
            <l>But I am not content.</l>
            <l>THREE SONGS TO THE ONE BURDEN</l>
            <l>THE Roaring Tinker if you like,</l>
            <l>But Mannion is my name,</l>
            <l>And I beat up the common sort</l>
            <l>And think it is no shame.</l>
            <l>The common breeds the common,</l>
            <l>A lout begets a lout,</l>
            <l>So when I take on half a score</l>
            <l>I knock their heads about.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>All Mannions come from Manannan,</l>
            <l>Though rich on every shore</l>
            <l>He never lay behind four walls</l>
            <l>He had such character,</l>
            <l>Nor ever made an iron red</l>
            <l>Nor soldered pot or pan;</l>
            <l>His roaring and his ranting</l>
            <l>Best please a wandering man.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>Could Crazy Jane put off old age</l>
            <l>And ranting time renew,</l>
            <l>Could that old god rise up again</l>
            <l>We'd drink a can or two,</l>
            <l>And out and lay our leadership</l>
            <l>On country and on town,</l>
            <l>Throw likely couples into bed</l>
            <l>And knock the others down.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>II</l>
            <l>My name is Henry Middleton,</l>
            <l>I have a small demesne,</l>
            <l>A small forgotten house that's set</l>
            <l>On a storm-bitten green.</l>
            <l>I scrub its floors and make my bed,</l>
            <l>I cook and change my plate,</l>
            <l>The post and garden-boy alone</l>
            <l>Have keys to my old gate.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>Though I have locked my gate on them,</l>
            <l>I pity all the young,</l>
            <l>I know what devil's trade they learn</l>
            <l>From those they live among,</l>
            <l>Their drink, their pitch-and-toss by day,</l>
            <l>Their robbery by night;</l>
            <l>The wisdom of the people's gone,</l>
            <l>How can the young go straight?</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>When every Sunday afternoon</l>
            <l>On the Green Lands I walk</l>
            <l>And wear a coat in fashion.</l>
            <l>Memories of the talk</l>
            <l>Of henwives and of queer old men</l>
            <l>Brace me and make me strong;</l>
            <l>There's not a pilot on the perch</l>
            <l>Knows I have lived so long.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>Come gather round me, players all:</l>
            <l>Come praise Nineteen-Sixteen,</l>
            <l>Those from the pit and gallery</l>
            <l>Or from the painted scene</l>
            <l>That fought in the Post Office</l>
            <l>Or round the City Hall,</l>
            <l>praise every man that came again,</l>
            <l>Praise every man that fell.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>Who was the first man shot that day?</l>
            <l>The player Connolly,</l>
            <l>Close to the City Hall he died;</l>
            <l>Catriage and voice had he;</l>
            <l>He lacked those years that go with skill,</l>
            <l>But later might have been</l>
            <l>A famous, a brilliant figure</l>
            <l>Before the painted scene.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>Some had no thought of victory</l>
            <l>But had gone out to die</l>
            <l>That Ireland's mind be greater,</l>
            <l>Her heart mount up on high;</l>
            <l>And yet who knows what's yet to come?</l>
            <l>For patrick pearse had said</l>
            <l>That in every generation</l>
            <l>Must Ireland's blood be shed.</l>
            <l>From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.</l>
            <l>IN TARA'S HALLS</l>
            <l>A MAN I praise that once in Tara's Hals</l>
            <l>Said to the woman on his knees, "Lie still.</l>
            <l>My hundredth year is at an end. I think</l>
            <l>That something is about to happen, I think</l>
            <l>That the adventure of old age begins.</l>
            <l>To many women I have said, ""Lie still,''</l>
            <l>And given everything a woman needs,</l>
            <l>A roof, good clothes, passion, love perhaps,</l>
            <l>But never asked for love; should I ask that,</l>
            <l>I shall be old indeed.'</l>
            <l>Thereon the man</l>
            <l>Went to the Sacred House and stood between</l>
            <l>The golden plough and harrow and spoke aloud</l>
            <l>That all attendants and the casual crowd might hear.</l>
            <l>"God I have loved, but should I ask return</l>
            <l>Of God or woman, the time were come to die.'</l>
            <l>He bade, his hundred and first year at end,</l>
            <l>Diggers and carpenters make grave and coffin;</l>
            <l>Saw that the grave was deep, the coffin sound,</l>
            <l>Summoned the generations of his house,</l>
            <l>Lay in the coffin, stopped his breath and died.</l>
            <l>THE STATUES</l>
            <l>PYTHAGORAS planned it. Why did the people stare?</l>
            <l>His numbers, though they moved or seemed to move</l>
            <l>In marble or in bronze, lacked character.</l>
            <l>But boys and girls, pale from the imagined love</l>
            <l>Of solitary beds, knew what they were,</l>
            <l>That passion could bring character enough,</l>
            <l>And pressed at midnight in some public place</l>
            <l>Live lips upon a plummet-measured face.</l>
            <l>No! Greater than Pythagoras, for the men</l>
            <l>That with a mallet or a chisel" modelled these</l>
            <l>Calculations that look but casual flesh, put down</l>
            <l>All Asiatic vague immensities,</l>
            <l>And not the banks of oars that swam upon</l>
            <l>The many-headed foam at Salamis.</l>
            <l>Europe put off that foam when Phidias</l>
            <l>Gave women dreams and dreams their looking-glass.</l>
            <l>One image crossed the many-headed, sat</l>
            <l>Under the tropic shade, grew round and slow,</l>
            <l>No Hamlet thin from eating flies, a fat</l>
            <l>Dreamer of the Middle Ages. Empty eyeballs knew</l>
            <l>That knowledge increases unreality, that</l>
            <l>Mirror on mirror mirrored is all the show.</l>
            <l>When gong and conch declare the hour to bless</l>
            <l>Grimalkin crawls to Buddha's emptiness.</l>
            <l>When Pearse summoned Cuchulain to his side.</l>
            <l>What stalked through the post Office? What intellect,</l>
            <l>What calculation, number, measurement, replied?</l>
            <l>We Irish, born into that ancient sect</l>
            <l>But thrown upon this filthy modern tide</l>
            <l>And by its formless spawning fury wrecked,</l>
            <l>Climb to our proper dark, that we may trace</l>
            <l>The lineaments of a plummet-measured face.</l>
            <l>April 9, 1938</l>
            <l>NEWS FOR THE DELPHIC ORACLE</l>
            <l>THERE all the golden codgers lay,</l>
            <l>There the silver dew,</l>
            <l>And the great water sighed for love,</l>
            <l>And the wind sighed too.</l>
            <l>Man-picker Niamh leant and sighed</l>
            <l>By Oisin on the grass;</l>
            <l>There sighed amid his choir of love</l>
            <l>Tall pythagoras.</l>
            <l>plotinus came and looked about,</l>
            <l>The salt-flakes on his breast,</l>
            <l>And having stretched and yawned awhile</l>
            <l>Lay sighing like the rest.</l>
            <l>Straddling each a dolphin's back</l>
            <l>And steadied by a fin,</l>
            <l>Those Innocents re-live their death,</l>
            <l>Their wounds open again.</l>
            <l>The ecstatic waters laugh because</l>
            <l>Their cries are sweet and strange,</l>
            <l>Through their ancestral patterns dance,</l>
            <l>And the brute dolphins plunge</l>
            <l>Until, in some cliff-sheltered bay</l>
            <l>Where wades the choir of love</l>
            <l>Proffering its sacred laurel crowns,</l>
            <l>They pitch their burdens off.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>Slim adolescence that a nymph has stripped,</l>
            <l>Peleus on Thetis stares.</l>
            <l>Her limbs are delicate as an eyelid,</l>
            <l>Love has blinded him with tears;</l>
            <l>But Thetis' belly listens.</l>
            <l>Down the mountain walls</l>
            <l>From where pan's cavern is</l>
            <l>Intolerable music falls.</l>
            <l>Foul goat-head, brutal arm appear,</l>
            <l>Belly, shoulder, bum,</l>
            <l>Flash fishlike; nymphs and satyrs</l>
            <l>Copulate in the foam.</l>
            <l>THREE MARCHING SONGS</l>
            <l>REMEMBER all those renowned generations,</l>
            <l>They left their bodies to fatten the wolves,</l>
            <l>They left their homesteads to fatten the foxes,</l>
            <l>Fled to far countries, or sheltered themselves</l>
            <l>In cavern, crevice, or hole,</l>
            <l>Defending Ireland's soul.</l>
            <l>Be still, be still, what can be said?</l>
            <l>My father sang that song,</l>
            <l>But time amends old wrong,</l>
            <l>All that is finished, let it fade.</l>
            <l>Remember all those renowned generations,</l>
            <l>Remember all that have sunk in their blood,</l>
            <l>Remember all that have died on the scaffold,</l>
            <l>Remember all that have fled, that have stood,</l>
            <l>Stood, took death like a tune</l>
            <l>On an old ,tambourine.</l>
            <l>Be still, be still, what can be said?</l>
            <l>My father sang that song,</l>
            <l>But time amends old wrong,</l>
            <l>And all that's finished, let it fade.</l>
            <l>Fail, and that history turns into rubbish,</l>
            <l>All that great past to a trouble of fools;</l>
            <l>Those that come after shall mock at O'Donnell,</l>
            <l>Mock at the memory of both O'Neills,</l>
            <l>Mock Emmet, mock Parnell,</l>
            <l>All the renown that fell.</l>
            <l>Be still, be still, what can be said?</l>
            <l>My father sang that song,</l>
            <l>but time amends old wrong,</l>
            <l>And all that's finished, let it fade.</l>
            <l>The soldier takes pride in saluting his Captain,</l>
            <l>The devotee proffers a knee to his Lord,</l>
            <l>Some back a mare thrown from a thoroughbred,,</l>
            <l>Troy backed its Helen; Troy died and adored;</l>
            <l>Great nations blossom above;</l>

            <l>What marches through the mountain pass?</l>
            <l>No, no, my son, not yet;</l>
            <l>That is an airy spot,</l>
            <l>And no man knows what treads the grass.</l>
            <l>We know what rascal might has defiled,</l>
            <l>The lofty innocence that it has slain,</l>
            <l>Were we not born in the peasant's cot</l>
            <l>Where men forgive if the belly gain?</l>
            <l>More dread the life that we live,</l>
            <l>How can the mind forgive?</l>
            <l>What marches down the mountain pass?</l>
            <l>No, no, my son, not yet;</l>
            <l>That is an airy spot,</l>
            <l>And no man knows what treads the grass.</l>
            <l>What if there's nothing up there at the top?</l>
            <l>Where are the captains that govern mankind?</l>
            <l>What tears down a tree that has nothing within it?</l>
            <l>A blast of the wind, O a marching wind,</l>
            <l>March wind, and any old tune.</l>
            <l>March, march, and how does it run?</l>
            <l>What marches down the mountain pass?</l>
            <l>No, no, my son, not yet;</l>
            <l>That is an airy spot,</l>

            <l>III</l>
            <l>Grandfather sang it under the gallows:</l>
            <l>"Hear, gentlemen, ladies, and all mankind:</l>
            <l>Money is good and a girl might be better,</l>
            <l>But good strong blows are delights to the mind.'</l>
            <l>There, standing on the cart,</l>
            <l>He sang it from his heart.</l>
            <l>Robbers had taken his old tambourine,</l>
            <l>But he took down the moon</l>
            <l>And rattled out a tunc;</l>
            <l>Robbers had taken his old tambourinc.</l>
            <l>"A girl I had, but she followed another,</l>
            <l>Money I had, and it went in the night,</l>
            <l>Strong drink I had, and it brought me to sorrow,</l>
            <l>But a good strong cause and blows are delight.'</l>
            <l>All there caught up the tune:</l>
            <l>"Oh, on, my darling man.'</l>
            <l>Robbers had taken his old tambourine,</l>
            <l>But he took down the moon</l>
            <l>And rattled out a tune;</l>
            <l>Robbers had taken his old tambourine.</l>
            <l>"Money is good and a girl might be better,</l>
            <l>No matter what happens and who takes the fall,</l>
            <l>But a good strong cause' — the rope gave a jerk there,</l>
            <l>No more sang he, for his throat was too small;</l>
            <l>But he kicked before he died,</l>
            <l>He did it out of pride.</l>
            <l>Robbers had taken his old tambourine,</l>
            <l>But he took down the moon</l>
            <l>And rattled out a tune;</l>
            <l>Robbers had taken his old tambourine.</l>
            <l>LONG-LEGGED FLY</l>
            <l>THAT civilisation may not sink,</l>
            <l>Its great battle lost,</l>
            <l>Quiet the dog, tether the pony</l>
            <l>To a distant post;</l>
            <l>Our master Caesar is in the tent</l>
            <l>Where the maps ate spread,</l>
            <l>His eyes fixed upon nothing,</l>
            <l>A hand under his head.</l>
            <l>Like a long-legged fly upon the stream</l>
            <l>His mind moves upon silence.</l>
            <l>That the topless towers be burnt</l>
            <l>And men recall that face,</l>
            <l>Move most gently if move you must</l>
            <l>In this lonely place.</l>
            <l>She thinks, part woman, three parts a child,</l>
            <l>That nobody looks; her feet</l>
            <l>Practise a tinker shuffle</l>
            <l>Picked up on a street.</l>
            <l>Like a long-legged fly upon the stream</l>
            <l>Her mind moves upon silence.</l>
            <l>That girls at puberty may find</l>
            <l>The first Adam in their thought,</l>
            <l>Shut the door of the Pope's chapel,</l>
            <l>Keep those children out.</l>
            <l>There on that scaffolding reclines</l>
            <l>Michael Angelo.</l>
            <l>With no more sound than the mice make</l>
            <l>His hand moves to and fro.</l>
            <l>Like a long-leggedfly upon the stream</l>
            <l>His mind moves upon silence.</l>
            <l>A BRONZE HEAD</l>
            <l>HERE at right of the entrance this bronze head,</l>
            <l>Human, superhuman, a bird's round eye,</l>
            <l>Everything else withered and mummy-dead.</l>
            <l>What great tomb-haunter sweeps the distant sky</l>
            <l>(Something may linger there though all else die;)</l>
            <l>And finds there nothing to make its tetror less</l>
            <l>Hysterica passio of its own emptiness?</l>
            <l>No dark tomb-haunter once; her form all full</l>
            <l>As though with magnanimity of light,</l>
            <l>Yet a most gentle woman; who can tell</l>
            <l>Which of her forms has shown her substance right?</l>
            <l>Or maybe substance can be composite,</l>
            <l>profound McTaggart thought so, and in a breath</l>
            <l>A mouthful held the extreme of life and death.</l>
            <l>But even at the starting-post, all sleek and new,</l>
            <l>I saw the wildness in her and I thought</l>
            <l>A vision of terror that it must live through</l>
            <l>Had shattered her soul. Propinquity had brought</l>
            <l>Imagiation to that pitch where it casts out</l>
            <l>All that is not itself: I had grown wild</l>
            <l>And wandered murmuring everywhere, "My child, my</l>
            <l>child! '</l>
            <l>Or else I thought her supernatural;</l>
            <l>As though a sterner eye looked through her eye</l>
            <l>On this foul world in its decline and fall;</l>
            <l>On gangling stocks grown great, great stocks run dry,</l>
            <l>Ancestral pearls all pitched into a sty,</l>
            <l>Heroic reverie mocked by clown and knave,</l>
            <l>And wondered what was left for massacre to save.</l>
            <l>A STICK OF INCENSE</l>
            <l>Whence did all that fury come?</l>
            <l>From empty tomb or Virgin womb?</l>
            <l>Saint Joseph thought the world would melt</l>
            <l>But liked the way his finger smelt.</l>
            <l>JOHN KINSELLA'S LAMENT FOR</l>
            <l>MRS. MARY MOORE</l>
            <l>A BLOODY and a sudden end,</l>
            <l>Gunshot or a noose,</l>
            <l>For Death who takes what man would keep,</l>
            <l>Leaves what man would lose.</l>
            <l>He might have had my sister,</l>
            <l>My cousins by the score,</l>
            <l>But nothing satisfied the fool</l>
            <l>But my dear Mary Moore,</l>
            <l>None other knows what pleasures man</l>
            <l>At table or in bed.</l>
            <l>What shall I do for pretty girls</l>
            <l>Now my old bawd is dead?</l>
            <l>Though stiff to strike a bargain,</l>
            <l>Like an old Jew man,</l>
            <l>Her bargain struck we laughed and talked</l>
            <l>And emptied many a can;</l>
            <l>And O! but she had stories,</l>
            <l>Though not for the priest's ear,</l>
            <l>To keep the soul of man alive,</l>
            <l>Banish age and care,</l>
            <l>And being old she put a skin</l>
            <l>On everything she said.</l>
            <l>What shall I do for pretty girls</l>
            <l>Now my old bawd is dead?</l>
            <l>The priests have got a book that says</l>
            <l>But for Adam's sin</l>
            <l>Eden's Garden would be there</l>
            <l>And I there within.</l>
            <l>No expectation fails there,</l>
            <l>No pleasing habit ends,</l>
            <l>No man grows old, no girl grows cold</l>
            <l>But friends walk by friends.</l>
            <l>Who quarrels over halfpennies</l>
            <l>That plucks the trees for bread?</l>
            <l>What shall I do for pretty girls</l>
            <l>Now my old bawd is dead?</l>
            <l>HOUND VOICE</l>
            <l>BECAUSE we love bare hills and stunted trees</l>
            <l>And were the last to choose the settled ground,</l>
            <l>Its boredom of the desk or of the spade, because</l>
            <l>So many years companioned by a hound,</l>
            <l>Our voices carry; and though slumber-bound,</l>
            <l>Some few half wake and half renew their choice,</l>
            <l>Give tongue, proclaim their hidden name — "Hound</l>
            <l>Voice. '</l>
            <l>The women that I picked spoke sweet and low</l>
            <l>And yet gave tongue. "Hound Voices' were they all.</l>
            <l>We picked each other from afar and knew</l>
            <l>What hour of terror comes to test the soul,</l>
            <l>And in that terror's name obeyed the call,</l>
            <l>And understood, what none have understood,</l>
            <l>Those images that waken in the blood.</l>
            <l>Some day we shall get up before the dawn</l>
            <l>And find our ancient hounds before the door,</l>
            <l>And wide awake know that the hunt is on;</l>
            <l>Stumbling upon the blood-dark track once more,</l>
            <l>Then stumbling to the kill beside the shore;</l>
            <l>Then cleaning out and bandaging of wounds,</l>
            <l>And chantS of victory amid the encircling hounds.</l>
            <l>HIGH TALK</l>
            <l>PROCESSIONS that lack high stilts have nothing that</l>
            <l>catches the eye.</l>
            <l>What if my great-granddad had a pair that were</l>
            <l>twenty foot high,</l>
            <l>And mine were but fifteen foot, no modern Stalks</l>
            <l>upon higher,</l>
            <l>Some rogue of the world stole them to patch up a fence</l>
            <l>or a fire.</l>
            <l>Because piebald ponies, led bears, caged lions, ake</l>
            <l>but poor shows,</l>
            <l>Because children demand Daddy-long-legs upon This</l>
            <l>timber toes,</l>
            <l>Because women in the upper storeys demand a face at</l>
            <l>the pane,</l>
            <l>That patching old heels they may shriek, I take to</l>

            <l>child.</l>
            <l>All metaphor, Malachi, stilts and all. A barnacle goose</l>
            <l>Far up in the stretches of night; night splits and the</l>
            <l>dawn breaks loose;</l>
            <l>I, through the terrible novelty of light, stalk on, stalk</l>
            <l>on;</l>

            <l>THE APPARITIONS</l>
            <l>BECAUSE there is safety in derision</l>
            <l>I talked about an apparition,</l>
            <l>I took no trouble to convince,</l>
            <l>Or seem plausible to a man of sense.</l>
            <l>Distrustful of thar popular eye</l>
            <l>Whether it be bold or sly.</l>
            <l>Fifteen apparitions have I seen;</l>
            <l>The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger.</l>
            <l>I have found nothing half so good</l>
            <l>As my long-planned half solitude,</l>
            <l>Where I can sit up half the night</l>
            <l>With some friend that has the wit</l>
            <l>Not to allow his looks to tell</l>
            <l>When I am unintelligible.</l>
            <l>Fifteen apparitions have I seen;</l>
            <l>The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger.</l>
            <l>When a man grows old his joy</l>
            <l>Grows more deep day after day,</l>
            <l>His empty heart is full at length,</l>
            <l>But he has need of all that strength</l>
            <l>Because of the increasing Night</l>
            <l>That opens her mystery and fright.</l>
            <l>Fifteen apparitions have I seen;</l>
            <l>The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger.</l>

            <l>Another star has shot an ear.</l>
            <l>What made the drapery glisten so?</l>
            <l>Not a man but Delacroix.</l>
            <l>What made the ceiling waterproof?</l>
            <l>Landor's tarpaulin on the roof</l>
            <l>What brushes fly and moth aside?</l>
            <l>Irving and his plume of pride.</l>
            <l>What hurries out the knaye and dolt?</l>
            <l>Talma and his thunderbolt.</l>
            <l>Why is the woman terror-struck?</l>
            <l>Can there be mercy in that look?</l>
            <l>WHY SHOULD NOT OLD MEN BE MAD?</l>
            <l>WHY should not old men be mad?</l>
            <l>Some have known a likely lad</l>
            <l>That had a sound fly-fisher's wrist</l>
            <l>Turn to a drunken journalist;</l>
            <l>A girl that knew all Dante once</l>
            <l>Live to bear children to a dunce;</l>
            <l>A Helen of social welfare dream,</l>
            <l>Climb on a wagonette to scream.</l>
            <l>Some think it a matter of course that chance</l>
            <l>Should starve good men and bad advance,</l>
            <l>That if their neighbours figured plain,</l>
            <l>As though upon a lighted screen,</l>
            <l>No single story would they find</l>
            <l>Of an unbroken happy mind,</l>
            <l>A finish worthy of the start.</l>
            <l>Young men know nothing of this sort,</l>
            <l>Observant old men know it well;</l>
            <l>And when they know what old books tell</l>
            <l>And that no better can be had,</l>
            <l>Know why an old man should be mad.</l>
            <l>THE STATESMAN'S HOLIDAY</l>
            <l>I LIVED among great houses,</l>
            <l>Riches drove out rank,</l>
            <l>Base drove out the better blood,</l>
            <l>And mind and body shrank.</l>
            <l>No Oscar ruled the table,</l>
            <l>But I'd a troop of friends</l>
            <l>That knowing better talk had gone</l>
            <l>Talked of odds and ends.</l>
            <l>Some knew what ailed the world</l>
            <l>But never said a thing,</l>
            <l>So I have picked a better trade</l>
            <l>And night and morning sing:</l>
            <l>Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.</l>
            <l>Am I a great Lord Chancellor</l>
            <l>That slept upon the Sack?</l>
            <l>Commanding officer that tore</l>
            <l>The khaki from his back?</l>
            <l>Or am I de Valera,</l>
            <l>Or the King of Greece,</l>
            <l>Or the man that made the motors?</l>
            <l>Ach, call me what you please!</l>
            <l>Here's a Montenegrin lute,</l>
            <l>And its old sole string</l>
            <l>Makes me sweet music</l>
            <l>And I delight to sing:</l>
            <l>Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.</l>
            <l>With boys and girls about him.</l>
            <l>With any sort of clothes,</l>
            <l>With a hat out of fashion,</l>
            <l>With Old patched shoes,</l>
            <l>With a ragged bandit cloak,</l>
            <l>With an eye like a hawk,</l>
            <l>With a stiff straight back,</l>
            <l>With a strutting turkey walk.</l>
            <l>With a bag full of pennies,</l>
            <l>With a monkey on a chain,</l>
            <l>With a great cock's feather,</l>
            <l>With an old foul tune.</l>
            <l>Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.</l>
            <l>CRAZY JANE ON THE MOUNTAIN</l>
            <l>I AM tired of cursing the Bishop,</l>
            <l>(Said Crazy Jane)</l>
            <l>Nine books or nine hats</l>
            <l>Would not make him a man.</l>
            <l>I have found something worse</l>
            <l>To meditate on.</l>
            <l>A King had some beautiful cousins.</l>
            <l>But where are they gone?</l>
            <l>Battered to death in a cellar,</l>
            <l>And he stuck to his throne.</l>
            <l>Last night I lay on the mountain.</l>
            <l>(Said Crazy Jane)</l>
            <l>There in a two-horsed carriage</l>
            <l>That on two wheels ran</l>
            <l>Great-bladdered Emer sat.</l>
            <l>Her violent man</l>
            <l>Cuchulain sat at her side;</l>
            <l>Thereupon'</l>
            <l>Propped upon my two knees,</l>
            <l>I kissed a stone</l>
            <l>I lay stretched out in the dirt</l>
            <l>And I cried tears down.</l>
            <l>THE CIRCUS ANIMAL DESERTION</l>
            <l>I SOUGHT a theme and sought for it in vain,</l>
            <l>I sought it daily for six weeks or so.</l>
            <l>Maybe at last, being but a broken man,</l>
            <l>I must be satisfied with my heart, although</l>
            <l>Winter and summer till old age began</l>
            <l>My circus animals were all on show,</l>
            <l>Those stilted boys, that burnished chariot,</l>
            <l>Lion and woman and the Lord knows what.</l>
            <l>II</l>
            <l>What can I but enumerate old themes?</l>
            <l>First that sea-rider Oisin led by the nose</l>
            <l>Through three enchanted islands, allegorical dreams,</l>
            <l>Vain gaiety, vain battle, vain repose,</l>
            <l>Themes of the embittered heart, or so it seems,</l>
            <l>That might adorn old songs or courtly shows;</l>
            <l>But what cared I that set him on to ride,</l>
            <l>I, starved for the bosom of his faery bride?</l>
            <l>And then a counter-truth filled out its play,</l>
            <l>The Countess Cathleen was the name I gave it;</l>
            <l>She, pity-crazed, had given her soul away,</l>
            <l>But masterful Heaven had intetvened to save it.</l>
            <l>I thought my dear must her own soul destroy,</l>
            <l>So did fanaticism and hate enslave it,</l>
            <l>And this brought forth a dream and soon enough</l>
            <l>This dream itself had all my thought and love.</l>
            <l>And when the Fool and Blind Man stole the bread</l>
            <l>Cuchulain fought the ungovernable sea;</l>
            <l>Heart-mysteries there, and yet when all is said</l>
            <l>It was the dream itself enchanted me:</l>
            <l>Character isolated by a deed</l>
            <l>To engross the present and dominate memory.</l>
            <l>players and painted stage took all my love,</l>
            <l>And not those things that they were emblems of.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>Those masterful images because complete</l>
            <l>Grew in pure mind, but out of what began?</l>
            <l>A mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street,</l>
            <l>Old kettles, old bottles, and a broken can,</l>
            <l>Old iron, old bones, old rags, that raving slut</l>
            <l>Who keeps the till. Now that my ladder's gone,</l>
            <l>I must lie down where all the ladders start</l>
            <l>In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart.</l>
            <l>POLITICS</l>
            <l>HOW can I, that girl standing there,</l>
            <l>My attention fix</l>
            <l>On Roman or on Russian</l>
            <l>Or on Spanish politics?</l>
            <l>Yet here's a travelled man that knows</l>
            <l>What he talks about,</l>
            <l>And there's a politician</l>
            <l>That has read and thought,</l>
            <l>And maybe what they say is true</l>
            <l>Of war and war's alarms,</l>
            <l>But O that I were young again</l>
            <l>And held her in my arms!</l>
            <l>THE MAN AND THE ECHO</l>
            <l>Man</l>
            <l>IN a cleft that's christened Alt</l>
            <l>Under broken stone I halt</l>
            <l>At the bottom of a pit</l>
            <l>That broad noon has never lit,</l>
            <l>And shout a secret to the stone.</l>
            <l>All that I have said and done,</l>
            <l>Now that I am old and ill,</l>
            <l>Turns into a question till</l>
            <l>I lie awake night after night</l>
            <l>And never get the answers right.</l>
            <l>Did that play of mine send out</l>
            <l>Certain men the English shot?</l>
            <l>Did words of mine put too great strain</l>
            <l>On that woman's reeling brain?</l>
            <l>Could my spoken words have checked</l>
            <l>That whereby a house lay wrecked?</l>
            <l>And all seems evil until I</l>
            <l>Sleepless would lie down and die.</l>
            <l>Echo</l>
            <l>Lie down and die.</l>
            <l>Man</l>
            <l>That were to shirk</l>
            <l>The spiritual intellect's great work,</l>
            <l>And shirk it in vain. There is no release</l>
            <l>In a bodkin or disease,</l>
            <l>Nor can there be work so great</l>
            <l>As that which cleans man's dirty slate.</l>
            <l>While man can still his body keep</l>
            <l>Wine or love drug him to sleep,</l>
            <l>Waking he thanks the Lord that he</l>
            <l>Has body and its stupidity,</l>
            <l>But body gone he sleeps no more,</l>
            <l>And till his intellect grows sure</l>
            <l>That all's arranged in one clear view,</l>
            <l>pursues the thoughts that I pursue,</l>
            <l>Then stands in judgment on his soul,</l>
            <l>And, all work done, dismisses all</l>
            <l>Out of intellect and sight</l>
            <l>And sinks at last into the night.</l>
            <l>Echo</l>
            <l>Into the night.</l>
            <l>Man</l>
            <l>O Rocky Voice,</l>
            <l>Shall we in that great night rejoice?</l>
            <l>What do we know but that we face</l>
            <l>One another in this place?</l>
            <l>But hush, for I have lost the theme,</l>
            <l>Its joy or night-seem but a dream;</l>
            <l>Up there some hawk or owl has struck,</l>
            <l>Dropping out of sky or rock,</l>
            <l>A stricken rabbit is crying out,</l>
            <l>And its cry distracts my thought.</l>
            <l>CUCHULAIN COMFORTED</l>
            <l>A MAN that had six mortal wounds, a man</l>
            <l>Violent and famous, strode among the dead;</l>
            <l>Eyes stared out of the branches and were gone.</l>
            <l>Then certain Shrouds that muttered head to head</l>
            <l>Came and were gone. He leant upon a tree</l>
            <l>As though to meditate on wounds and blood.</l>
            <l>A Shroud that seemed to have authority</l>
            <l>Among those bird-like things came, and let fall</l>
            <l>A bundle of linen. Shrouds by two and thrce</l>
            <l>Came creeping up because the man was still.</l>
            <l>And thereupon that linen-carrier said:</l>
            <l>"Your life can grow much sweeter if you will</l>
            <l>"Obey our ancient rule and make a shroud;</l>
            <l>Mainly because of what we only know</l>
            <l>The rattle of those arms makes us afraid.</l>
            <l>"We thread the needles' eyes, and all we do</l>
            <l>All must together do.' That done, the man</l>
            <l>Took up the nearest and began to sew.</l>
            <l>"Now must we sing and sing the best we can,</l>
            <l>But first you must be told our character:</l>
            <l>Convicted cowards all, by kindred slain</l>
            <l>"Or driven from home and left to dic in fear.'</l>
            <l>They sang, but had nor human tunes nor words,</l>
            <l>Though all was done in common as before;</l>
            <l>They had changed their thtoats and had the throats of</l>
            <l>birds.</l>
            <l>THE BLACK TOWER</l>
            <l>SAY that the men of the old black tower,</l>
            <l>Though they but feed as the goatherd feeds,</l>
            <l>Their money spent, their wine gone sour,</l>
            <l>Lack nothing that a soldier needs,</l>
            <l>That all are oath-bound men:</l>
            <l>Those banners come not in.</l>
            <l>There in the tomb stand the dead upright,</l>
            <l>But winds come up from the shore:</l>
            <l>They shake when the winds roar,</l>
            <l>Old bones upon the mountain shake.</l>
            <l>Those banners come to bribe or threaten,</l>
            <l>Or whisper that a man's a fool</l>
            <l>Who, when his own right king's forgotten,</l>
            <l>Cares what king sets up his rule.</l>
            <l>If he died long ago</l>
            <l>Why do yopu dread us so?</l>
            <l>There in the tomb drops the faint moonlight,</l>
            <l>But wind comes up from the shore:</l>
            <l>They shake when the winds roar,</l>
            <l>Old bones upon the mountain shake.</l>
            <l>The tower's old cook that must climb and clamber</l>
            <l>Catching small birds in the dew of the morn</l>
            <l>When we hale men lie stretched in slumber</l>
            <l>Swears that he hears the king's great horn.</l>
            <l>But he's a lying hound:</l>
            <l>Stand we on guard oath-bound!</l>
            <l>There in the tomb the dark grows blacker,</l>
            <l>But wind comes up from the shore:</l>
            <l>They shake when the winds roar,</l>
            <l>Old bones upon the mountain shake.</l>
            <l>UNDER BEN BULBEN</l>
            <l>I</l>
            <l>SWEAR by what the sages spoke</l>
            <l>Round the Mareotic Lake</l>
            <l>That the Witch of Atlas knew,</l>
            <l>Spoke and set the cocks a-crow.</l>
            <l>Swear by those horsemen, by those women</l>
            <l>Complexion and form prove superhuman,</l>
            <l>That pale, long-visaged company</l>
            <l>That air in immortality</l>
            <l>Completeness of their passions won;</l>
            <l>Now they ride the wintry dawn</l>
            <l>Where Ben Bulben sets the scene.</l>
            <l>Here s the gist of what they mean.</l>
            <l>II</l>
            <l>Many times man lives and dies</l>
            <l>Between his two eternities,</l>
            <l>That of race and that of soul,</l>
            <l>And ancient Ireland knew it all.</l>
            <l>Whether man die in his bed</l>
            <l>Or the rifle knocks him dead,</l>
            <l>A brief parting from those dear</l>
            <l>Is the worst man has to fear.</l>
            <l>Though grave-diggers' toil is long,</l>
            <l>Sharp their spades, their muscles strong.</l>
            <l>They but thrust their buried men</l>
            <l>Back in the human mind again.</l>
            <l>III</l>
            <l>You that Mitchel's prayer have heard,</l>
            <l>"Send war in our time, O Lord!'</l>
            <l>Know that when all words are said</l>
            <l>And a man is fighting mad,</l>
            <l>Something drops from eyes long blind,</l>
            <l>He completes his partial mind,</l>
            <l>For an instant stands at ease,</l>
            <l>Laughs aloud, his heart at peace.</l>
            <l>Even the wisest man grows tense</l>
            <l>With some sort of violence</l>
            <l>Before he can accomplish fate,</l>
            <l>Know his work or choose his mate.</l>
            <l>IV</l>
            <l>Poet and sculptor, do the work,</l>
            <l>Nor let the modish painter shirk</l>
            <l>What his great forefathers did.</l>
            <l>Bring the soul of man to God,</l>
            <l>Make him fill the cradles right.</l>
            <l>Measurement began our might:</l>
            <l>Forms a stark Egyptian thought,</l>
            <l>Forms that gentler phidias wrought.</l>
            <l>Michael Angelo left a proof</l>
            <l>On the Sistine Chapel roof,</l>
            <l>Where but half-awakened Adam</l>
            <l>Can disturb globe-trotting Madam</l>

            <l>THE WANDERINGS OF OISIN</l>
            <l>1889</l>
            <l>BOOK I</l>
            <l>S. Patrick. You who are bent, and bald, and blind,</l>
            <l>With a heavy heart and a wandering mind,</l>
            <l>Have known three centuries, poets sing,</l>
            <l>Of dalliance with a demon thing.</l>
            <l>Oisin. Sad to remember, sick with years,</l>
            <l>The swift innumerable spears,</l>
            <l>The horsemen with their floating hair,</l>
            <l>And bowls of barley, honey, and wine,</l>
            <l>Those merry couples dancing in tune,</l>
            <l>And the white body that lay by mine;</l>
            <l>But the tale, though words be lighter than air.</l>
            <l>Must live to be old like the wandering moon.</l>
            <l>Caoilte, and Conan, and Finn were there,</l>
            <l>When we followed a deer with our baying hounds.</l>
            <l>With Bran, Sceolan, and Lomair,</l>
            <l>And passing the Firbolgs' burial-motmds,</l>
            <l>Came to the cairn-heaped grassy hill</l>
            <l>Where passionate Maeve is stony-still;</l>
            <l>And found On the dove-grey edge of the sea</l>
            <l>A pearl-pale, high-born lady, who rode</l>
            <l>On a horse with bridle of findrinny;</l>
            <l>And like a sunset were her lips,</l>
            <l>A stormy sunset on doomed ships;</l>
            <l>A citron colour gloomed in her hair,</l>
            <l>But down to her feet white vesture flowed,</l>
            <l>And with the glimmering crimson glowed</l>
            <l>Of many a figured embroidery;</l>
            <l>And it was bound with a pearl-pale shell</l>
            <l>That wavered like the summer streams,</l>
            <l>As her soft bosom rose and fell.</l>
            <l>S. Patrick. You are still wrecked among heathen dreams.</l>
            <l>Oisin. "Why do you wind no horn?' she said</l>
            <l>"And every hero droop his head?</l>
            <l>The hornless deer is not more sad</l>
            <l>That many a peaceful moment had,</l>
            <l>More sleek than any granary mouse,</l>
            <l>In his own leafy forest house</l>
            <l>Among the waving fields of fern:</l>
            <l>The hunting of heroes should be glad.'</l>
            <l>'O pleasant woman,' answered Finn,</l>
            <l>"We think on Oscar's pencilled urn,</l>
            <l>And on the heroes lying slain</l>
            <l>On Gabhra's raven-covered plain;</l>
            <l>But where are your noble kith and kin,</l>
            <l>And from what country do you ride?'</l>
            <l>"My father and my mother are</l>
            <l>Aengus and Edain, my own name</l>
            <l>Niamh, and my country far</l>
            <l>Beyond the tumbling of this tide.'</l>
            <l>"What dream came with you that you came</l>
            <l>Through bitter tide on foam-wet feet?</l>
            <l>Did your companion wander away</l>
            <l>From where the birds of Aengus wing?'</l>
            <l>Thereon did she look haughty and sweet:</l>
            <l>"I have not yet, war-weary king,</l>
            <l>Been spoken of with any man;</l>
            <l>Yet now I choose, for these four feet</l>
            <l>Ran through the foam and ran to this</l>
            <l>That I might have your son to kiss.'</l>
            <l>"Were there no better than my son</l>
            <l>That you through all that foam should run?'</l>
            <l>"I loved no man, though kings besought,</l>
            <l>Until the Danaan poets brought</l>
            <l>Rhyme that rhymed upon Oisin's name,</l>
            <l>And now I am dizzy with the thought</l>
            <l>Of all that wisdom and the fame</l>
            <l>Of battles broken by his hands,</l>
            <l>Of stories builded by his words</l>
            <l>That are like coloured Asian birds</l>
            <l>At evening in their rainless lands.'</l>
            <l>O Patrick, by your brazen bell,</l>
            <l>There was no limb of mine but fell</l>
            <l>Into a desperate gulph of love!</l>
            <l>'You only will I wed,' I cried,</l>
            <l>"And I will make a thousand songs,</l>
            <l>And set your name all names above,</l>
            <l>And captives bound with leathern thongs</l>
            <l>Shall kneel and praise you, one by one,</l>
            <l>At evening in my western dun.'</l>
            <l>"O Oisin, mount by me and ride</l>
            <l>To shores by the wash of the tremulous tide,</l>
            <l>Where men have heaped no burial-mounds,</l>
            <l>And the days pass by like a wayward tune,</l>
            <l>Where broken faith has never been known</l>
            <l>And the blushes of first love never have flown;</l>
            <l>And there I will give you a hundred hounds;</l>
            <l>No mightier creatures bay at the moon;</l>
            <l>And a hundred robes of murmuring silk,</l>
            <l>And a hundred calves and a hundred sheep</l>
            <l>Whose long wool whiter than sea-froth flows,</l>
            <l>And a hundred spears and a hundred bows,</l>
            <l>And oil and wine and honey and milk,</l>
            <l>And always never-anxious sleep;</l>
            <l>While a hundred youths, mighty of limb,</l>
            <l>But knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife,</l>
            <l>And a hundred ladies, merry as birds,</l>
            <l>Who when they dance to a fitful measure</l>
            <l>Have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds,</l>
            <l>Shall follow your horn and obey your whim,</l>
            <l>And you shall know the Danaan leisure;</l>
            <l>And Niamh be with you for a wife.'</l>
            <l>Then she sighed gently, "It grows late.</l>
            <l>Music and love and sleep await,</l>
            <l>Where I would be when the white moon climbs,</l>
            <l>The red sun falls and the world grows dim.'</l>
            <l>And then I mounted and she bound me</l>
            <l>With her triumphing arms around me,</l>
            <l>And whispering to herself enwound me;</l>
            <l>He shook himself and neighed three times:</l>
            <l>Caoilte, Conan, and Finn came near,</l>
            <l>And wept, and raised their lamenting hands,</l>
            <l>And bid me stay, with many a tear;</l>
            <l>But we rode out from the human lands.</l>
            <l>In what far kingdom do you go'</l>
            <l>Ah Fenians, with the shield and bow?</l>
            <l>Or are you phantoms white as snow,</l>
            <l>Whose lips had life's most prosperous glow?</l>
            <l>O you, with whom in sloping vallcys,</l>
            <l>Or down the dewy forest alleys,</l>
            <l>I chased at morn the flying deer,</l>
            <l>With whom I hurled the hurrying spear,</l>
            <l>And heard the foemen's bucklers rattle,</l>
            <l>And broke the heaving ranks of battle!</l>
            <l>And Bran, Sceolan, and Lomair,</l>
            <l>Where are you with your long rough hair?</l>
            <l>You go not where the red deer feeds,</l>
            <l>Nor tear the foemen from their steeds.</l>
            <l>S. Patrick. Boast not, nor mourn with drooping head</l>
            <l>Companions long accurst and dead,</l>
            <l>And hounds for centuries dust and air.</l>
            <l>Oisin. We galloped over the glossy sea:</l>
            <l>I know not if days passed or hours,</l>
            <l>And Niamh sang continually</l>
            <l>Danaan songs, and their dewy showers</l>
            <l>Of pensive laughter, unhuman sound,</l>
            <l>Lulled weariness, and softly round</l>
            <l>My human sorrow her white arms wound.</l>
            <l>We galloped; now a hornless deer</l>
            <l>Passed by us, chased by a phantom hound</l>
            <l>All pearly white, save one red ear;</l>
            <l>And now a lady rode like the wind</l>
            <l>With an apple of gold in her tossing hand;</l>
            <l>And a beautiful young man followed behind</l>
            <l>With quenchless gaze and fluttering hair.</l>
            <l>"Were these two born in the Danaan land,</l>
            <l>Or have they breathed the mortal air?'</l>
            <l>"Vex them no longer,' Niamh said,</l>
            <l>And sighing bowed her gentle head,</l>
            <l>And sighing laid the pearly tip</l>
            <l>Of one long finger on my lip.</l>
            <l>But now the moon like a white rose shone</l>
            <l>In the pale west, and the sun'S rim sank,</l>
            <l>And clouds atrayed their rank on rank</l>
            <l>About his fading crimson ball:</l>
            <l>The floor of Almhuin's hosting hall</l>
            <l>Was not more level than the sea,</l>
            <l>As, full of loving fantasy,</l>
            <l>And with low murmurs, we rode on,</l>
            <l>Where many a trumpet-twisted shell</l>
            <l>That in immortal silence sleeps</l>
            <l>Dreaming of her own melting hues,</l>
            <l>Her golds, her ambers, and her blues,</l>
            <l>Pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps.</l>
            <l>But now a wandering land breeze came</l>
            <l>And a far sound of feathery quires;</l>
            <l>It seemed to blow from the dying flame,</l>
            <l>They seemed to sing in the smouldering fires.</l>
            <l>The horse towards the music raced,</l>
            <l>Neighing along the lifeless waste;</l>
            <l>Like sooty fingers, many a tree</l>
            <l>Rose ever out of the warm sea;</l>
            <l>And they were trembling ceaselessly,</l>
            <l>As though they all were beating time,</l>
            <l>Upon the centre of the sun,</l>
            <l>To that low laughing woodland rhyme.</l>
            <l>And, now our wandering hours were done,</l>
            <l>We cantered to the shore, and knew</l>
            <l>The reason of the trembling trees:</l>
            <l>Round every branch the song-birds flew,</l>
            <l>Or clung thereon like swarming bees;</l>
            <l>While round the shore a million stood</l>
            <l>Like drops of frozen rainbow light,</l>
            <l>And pondered in a soft vain mood</l>
            <l>Upon their shadows in the tide,</l>
            <l>And told the purple deeps their pride,</l>
            <l>And murmured snatches of delight;</l>
            <l>And on the shores were many boats</l>
            <l>With bending sterns and bending bows,</l>
            <l>And carven figures on their prows</l>
            <l>Of bitterns, and fish-eating stoats,</l>
            <l>And swans with their exultant throats:</l>
            <l>And where the wood and waters meet</l>
            <l>We tied the horse in a leafy clump,</l>
            <l>And Niamh blew three merry notes</l>
            <l>Out of a little silver trump;</l>
            <l>And then an answering whispering flew</l>
            <l>Over the bare and woody land,</l>
            <l>A whisper of impetuous feet,</l>
            <l>And ever nearer, nearer grew;</l>
            <l>And from the woods rushed out a band</l>
            <l>Of men and ladies, hand in hand,</l>
            <l>And singing, singing all together;</l>
            <l>Their brows were white as fragrant milk,</l>
            <l>Their cloaks made out of yellow silk,</l>
            <l>And trimmed with many a crimson feather;</l>
            <l>And when they saw the cloak I wore</l>
            <l>Was dim with mire of a mortal shore,</l>
            <l>They fingered it and gazed on me</l>
            <l>And laughed like murmurs of the sea;</l>
            <l>But Niamh with a swift distress</l>
            <l>Bid them away and hold their peace;</l>
            <l>And when they heard her voice they ran</l>
            <l>And knelt there, every girl and man,</l>
            <l>And kissed, as they would never cease,</l>
            <l>Her pearl-pale hand and the hem of her dress.</l>
            <l>She bade them bring us to the hall</l>
            <l>Where Aengus dreams, from sun to sun,</l>
            <l>A Druid dream of the end of days</l>
            <l>When the stars are to wane and the world be done.</l>
            <l>They led us by long and shadowy ways</l>
            <l>Where drops of dew in myriads fall,</l>
            <l>And tangled creepers every hour</l>
            <l>Blossom in some new crimson flower,</l>
            <l>And once a sudden laughter sprang</l>
            <l>From all their lips, and once they sang</l>
            <l>Together, while the dark woods rang,</l>
            <l>And made in all their distant parts,</l>
            <l>With boom of bees in honey-marts,</l>
            <l>A rumour of delighted hearts.</l>
            <l>And once a lady by my side</l>
            <l>Gave me a harp, and bid me sing,</l>
            <l>And touch the laughing silver string;</l>
            <l>But when I sang of human joy</l>
            <l>A sorrow wrapped each merry face,</l>
            <l>And, patrick! by your beard, they wept,</l>
            <l>Until one came, a tearful boy;</l>
            <l>"A sadder creature never stept</l>
            <l>Than this strange human bard,' he cried;</l>
            <l>And caught the silver harp away,</l>
            <l>And, weeping over the white strings, hurled</l>
            <l>It down in a leaf-hid, hollow place</l>
            <l>That kept dim waters from the sky;</l>
            <l>And each one said, with a long, long sigh,</l>
            <l>"O saddest harp in all the world,</l>
            <l>Sleep there till the moon and the stars die!'</l>
            <l>And now, still sad, we came to where</l>
            <l>A beautiful young man dreamed within</l>
            <l>A house of wattles, clay, and skin;</l>
            <l>One hand upheld his beardless chin,</l>
            <l>And one a sceptre flashing out</l>
            <l>Wild flames of red and gold and blue,</l>
            <l>Like to a merry wandering rout</l>
            <l>Of dancers leaping in the air;</l>
            <l>And men and ladies knelt them there</l>
            <l>And showed their eyes with teardrops dim,</l>
            <l>And with low murmurs prayed to him,</l>
            <l>And kissed the sceptre with red lips,</l>
            <l>And touched it with their finger-tips.</l>
            <l>He held that flashing sceptre up.</l>
            <l>"Joy drowns the twilight in the dew,</l>
            <l>And fills with stars night's purple cup,</l>
            <l>And wakes the sluggard seeds of corn,</l>
            <l>And stirs the young kid's budding horn,</l>
            <l>And makes the infant ferns unwrap,</l>
            <l>And for the peewit paints his cap,</l>
            <l>And rolls along the unwieldy sun,</l>
            <l>And makes the little planets run:</l>
            <l>And if joy were not on the earth,</l>
            <l>There were an end of change and birth,</l>
            <l>And Earth and Heaven and Hell would die,</l>
            <l>And in some gloomy barrow lie</l>
            <l>Folded like a frozen fly;</l>
            <l>Then mock at Death and Time with glances</l>
            <l>And wavering arms and wandering dances.</l>
            <l>"Men's hearts of old were drops of flame</l>
            <l>That from the saffron morning came,</l>
            <l>Or drops of silver joy that fell</l>
            <l>Out of the moon's pale twisted shell;</l>
            <l>But now hearts cry that hearts are slaves,</l>
            <l>And toss and turn in narrow caves;</l>
            <l>But here there is nor law nor rule,</l>
            <l>Nor have hands held a weary tool;</l>
            <l>And here there is nor Change nor Death,</l>
            <l>But only kind and merry breath,</l>
            <l>For joy is God and God is joy.'</l>
            <l>With one long glance for girl and boy</l>
            <l>And the pale blossom of the moon,</l>
            <l>He fell into a Druid swoon.</l>
            <l>And in a wild and sudden dance</l>
            <l>We mocked at Time and Fate and Chance</l>
            <l>And swept out of the wattled hall</l>
            <l>And came to where the dewdrops fall</l>
            <l>Among the foamdrops of the sea,</l>
            <l>And there we hushed the revelry;</l>
            <l>And, gathering on our brows a frown,</l>
            <l>Bent all our swaying bodies down,</l>
            <l>And to the waves that glimmer by</l>
            <l>That sloping green De Danaan sod</l>
            <l>Sang, "God is joy and joy is God,</l>
            <l>And things that have grown sad are wicked,</l>
            <l>And things that fear the dawn of the morrow</l>
            <l>Or the grey wandering osprey Sorrow.'</l>
            <l>We danced to where in the winding thicket</l>
            <l>The damask roses, bloom on bloom,</l>
            <l>Like crimson meteors hang in the gloom.</l>
            <l>And bending over them softly said,</l>
            <l>Bending over them in the dance,</l>
            <l>With a swift and friendly glance</l>
            <l>From dewy eyes: "Upon the dead</l>
            <l>Fall the leaves of other roses,</l>
            <l>On the dead dim earth encloses:</l>
            <l>But never, never on our graves,</l>
            <l>Heaped beside the glimmering waves,</l>
            <l>Shall fall the leaves of damask roses.</l>
            <l>For neither Death nor Change comes near us,</l>
            <l>And all listless hours fear us,</l>
            <l>And we fear no dawning morrow,</l>
            <l>Nor the grey wandering osprey Sorrow.'</l>
            <l>The dance wound through the windless woods;</l>
            <l>The ever-summered solitudes;</l>
            <l>Until the tossing arms grew still</l>
            <l>Upon the woody central hill;</l>
            <l>And, gathered in a panting band,</l>
            <l>We flung on high each waving hand,</l>
            <l>And sang unto the starry broods.</l>
            <l>In our raised eyes there flashed a glow</l>
            <l>Of milky brightness to and fro</l>
            <l>As thus our song arose: "You stars,</l>
            <l>Across your wandering ruby cars</l>
            <l>Shake the loose reins: you slaves of God.</l>
            <l>He rules you with an iron rod,</l>
            <l>He holds you with an iron bond,</l>
            <l>Each one woven to the other,</l>
            <l>Each one woven to his brother</l>
            <l>Like bubbles in a frozen pond;</l>
            <l>But we in a lonely land abide</l>
            <l>Unchainable as the dim tide,</l>
            <l>With hearts that know nor law nor rule,</l>
            <l>And hands that hold no wearisome tool,</l>
            <l>Folded in love that fears no morrow,</l>
            <l>Nor the grey wandering osprey Sorrow.'</l>
            <l>O Patrick! for a hundred years</l>
            <l>I chased upon that woody shore</l>
            <l>The deer, the badger, and the boar.</l>
            <l>O patrick! for a hundred years</l>
            <l>At evening on the glimmering sands,</l>
            <l>Beside the piled-up hunting spears,</l>
            <l>These now outworn and withered hands</l>
            <l>Wrestled among the island bands.</l>
            <l>O patrick! for a hundred years</l>
            <l>We went a-fishing in long boats</l>
            <l>With bending sterns and bending bows,</l>
            <l>And carven figures on their prows</l>
            <l>Of bitterns and fish-eating stoats.</l>
            <l>O patrick! for a hundred years</l>
            <l>The gentle Niamh was my wife;</l>
            <l>But now two things devour my life;</l>
            <l>The things that most of all I hate:</l>
            <l>Fasting and prayers.</l>
            <l>S. Patrick. Tell On.</l>
            <l>Oisin . Yes, yes,</l>
            <l>For these were ancient Oisin's fate</l>
            <l>Loosed long ago from Heaven's gate,</l>
            <l>For his last days to lie in wait.</l>
            <l>When one day by the tide I stood,</l>
            <l>I found in that forgetfulness</l>
            <l>Of dreamy foam a staff of wood</l>
            <l>From some dead warrior's broken lance:</l>
            <l>I tutned it in my hands; the stains</l>
            <l>Of war were on it, and I wept,</l>
            <l>Remembering how the Fenians stept</l>
            <l>Along the blood-bedabbled plains,</l>
            <l>Equal to good or grievous chance:</l>
            <l>Thereon young Niamh softly came</l>
            <l>And caught my hands, but spake no word</l>
            <l>Save only many times my name,</l>
            <l>In murmurs, like a frighted bird.</l>
            <l>We passed by woods, and lawns of clover,</l>
            <l>And found the horse and bridled him,</l>
            <l>For we knew well the old was over.</l>
            <l>I heard one say, "His eyes grow dim</l>
            <l>With all the ancient sorrow of men';</l>
            <l>And wrapped in dreams rode out again</l>
            <l>With hoofs of the pale findrinny</l>
            <l>Over the glimmering purple sea.</l>
            <l>Under the golden evening light,</l>
            <l>The Immortals moved among thc fountains</l>
            <l>By rivers and the woods' old night;</l>
            <l>Some danced like shadows on the mountains</l>
            <l>Some wandered ever hand in hand;</l>
            <l>Or sat in dreams on the pale strand,</l>
            <l>Each forehead like an obscure star</l>
            <l>Bent down above each hooked knee,</l>
            <l>And sang, and with a dreamy gaze</l>
            <l>Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze</l>
            <l>Was slumbering half in the sea-ways;</l>
            <l>And, as they sang, the painted birds</l>
            <l>Kept time with their bright wings and feet;</l>
            <l>Like drops of honey came their words,</l>
            <l>But fainter than a young lamb's bleat.</l>
            <l>"An old man stirs the fire to a blaze,</l>
            <l>In the house of a child, of a friend, of a brother.</l>
            <l>He has over-lingered his welcome; the days,</l>
            <l>Grown desolate, whisper and sigh to each other;</l>
            <l>He hears the storm in the chimney above,</l>
            <l>And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold,</l>
            <l>While his heart still dreams of battle and love,</l>
            <l>And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old.</l>
            <l>But We are apart in the grassy places,</l>
            <l>Where care cannot trouble the least of our days,</l>
            <l>Or the softness of youth be gone from our faces,</l>
            <l>Or love's first tenderness die in our gaze.</l>
            <l>The hare grows old as she plays in the sun</l>
            <l>And gazes around her with eyes of brightness;</l>
            <l>Before the swift things that she dreamed of were done</l>
            <l>She limps along in an aged whiteness;</l>
            <l>A storm of birds in the Asian trees</l>
            <l>Like tulips in the air a-winging,</l>
            <l>And the gentle waves of the summer seas,</l>
            <l>That raise their heads and wander singing,</l>
            <l>Must murmur at last, ""Unjust, unjust';</l>
            <l>And ""My speed is a weariness,' falters the mouse,</l>
            <l>And the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust,</l>
            <l>And the roof falls in of his tunnelled house.</l>
            <l>But the love-dew dims our eyes till the day</l>
            <l>When God shall come from the Sea with a sigh</l>
            <l>And bid the stars drop down from the sky,</l>
            <l>And the moon like a pale rose wither away.'</l>
            <l>BOOK II</l>
            <l>NOW, man of croziers, shadows called our names</l>
            <l>And then away, away, like whirling flames;</l>
            <l>And now fled by, mist-covered, without sound,</l>
            <l>The youth and lady and the deer and hound;</l>
            <l>"Gaze no more on the phantoms,' Niamh said,</l>
            <l>And kissed my eyes, and, swaying her bright head</l>
            <l>And her bright body, sang of faery and man</l>
            <l>Before God was or my old line began;</l>
            <l>Wars shadowy, vast, exultant; faeries of old</l>
            <l>Who wedded men with rings of Druid gold;</l>
            <l>And how those lovers never turn their eyes</l>
            <l>Upon the life that fades and flickers and dies,</l>
            <l>Yet love and kiss on dim shores far away</l>
            <l>Rolled round with music of the sighing spray:</l>
            <l>Yet sang no more as when, like a brown bee</l>
            <l>That has drunk full, she crossed the misty sea</l>
            <l>With me in her white arms a hundred years</l>
            <l>Before this day; for now the fall of tears</l>
            <l>Troubled her song.</l>
            <l>I do not know if days</l>
            <l>Or hours passed by, yet hold the morning rays</l>
            <l>Shone many times among the glimmering flowers</l>
            <l>Woven into her hair, before dark towers</l>
            <l>Rose in the darkness, and the white surf gleamed</l>
            <l>About them; and the horse of Faery screamed</l>
            <l>And shivered, knowing the Isle of Many Fears,</l>
            <l>Nor ceased until white Niamh stroked his ears</l>
            <l>And named him by sweet names.</l>
            <l>A foaming tide</l>
            <l>Whitened afar with surge, fan-formed and wide,</l>
            <l>Burst from a great door matred by many a blow</l>
            <l>From mace and sword and pole-axe, long ago</l>
            <l>When gods and giants warred. We rode between</l>
            <l>The seaweed-covered pillars; and the green</l>
            <l>And surging phosphorus alone gave light</l>
            <l>On our dark pathway, till a countless flight</l>
            <l>Of moonlit steps glimmered; and left and right</l>
            <l>Dark statues glimmered over the pale tide</l>
            <l>Upon dark thrones. Between the lids of one</l>
            <l>The imaged meteors had flashed and run</l>
            <l>And had disported in the stilly jet,</l>
            <l>And the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set,</l>
            <l>Since God made Time and Death and Sleep: the other</l>
            <l>Stretched his long arm to where, a misty smother,</l>
            <l>The stream churned, churned, and churned — his lips</l>
            <l>apart,</l>
            <l>As though he told his never-slumbering heart</l>
            <l>Of every foamdrop on its misty way.</l>
            <l>Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay</l>
            <l>Half in the unvesselled sea, we climbed the stair</l>
            <l>And climbed so long, I thought the last steps were</l>
            <l>Hung from the morning star; when these mild words</l>
            <l>Fanned the delighted air like wings of birds:</l>
            <l>"My brothers spring out of their beds at morn,</l>
            <l>A-murmur like young partridge: with loud horn</l>
            <l>They chase the noontide deer;</l>
            <l>And when the dew-drowned stars hang in the air</l>
            <l>Look to long fishing-lines, or point and pare</l>
            <l>An ashen hunting spear.</l>
            <l>O sigh, O fluttering sigh, be kind to me;</l>
            <l>Flutter along the froth lips of the sea,</l>
            <l>And shores the froth lips wet:</l>
            <l>And stay a little while, and bid them weep:</l>
            <l>Ah, touch their blue-veined eyelids if they sleep,</l>
            <l>And shake their coverlet.</l>
            <l>When you have told how I weep endlessly,</l>
            <l>Flutter along the froth lips of the sea</l>
            <l>And home to me again,</l>
            <l>And in the shadow of my hair lie hid,</l>
            <l>And tell me that you found a man unbid,</l>
            <l>The saddest of all men.'</l>
            <l>A lady with soft eyes like funeral tapers,</l>
            <l>And face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours,</l>
            <l>And a sad mouth, that fear made tremulous</l>
            <l>As any ruddy moth, looked down on us;</l>
            <l>And she with a wave-rusted chain was tied</l>
            <l>To two old eagles, full of ancient pride,</l>
            <l>That with dim eyeballs stood on either side.</l>
            <l>Few feathers were on their dishevelled wings,</l>
            <l>For their dim minds were with the ancient things.</l>
            <l>"I bring deliverance,' pearl-pale Niamh said.</l>
            <l>"Neither the living, nor the unlabouring dead,</l>
            <l>Nor the high gods who never lived, may fight</l>
            <l>My enemy and hope; demons for fright</l>
            <l>Jabber and scream about him in the night;</l>
            <l>For he is strong and crafty as the seas</l>
            <l>That sprang under the Seven Hazel Trees,</l>
            <l>And I must needs endure and hate and weep,</l>
            <l>Until the gods and demons drop asleep,</l>
            <l>Hearing Acdh touch thc mournful strings of gold.'</l>
            <l>"Is he So dreadful?'</l>
            <l>"Be not over-bold,</l>
            <l>But fly while still you may.'</l>
            <l>And thereon I:</l>
            <l>"This demon shall be battered till he die,</l>
            <l>And his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide.'</l>
            <l>"Flee from him,' pearl-pale Niamh weeping cried,</l>
            <l>"For all men flee the demons'; but moved not</l>
            <l>My angry king-remembering soul one jot.</l>
            <l>There was no mightier soul of Heber's line;</l>
            <l>Now it is old and mouse-like. For a sign</l>
            <l>I burst the chain: still earless, neNeless, blind,</l>
            <l>Wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind,</l>
            <l>In some dim memory or ancient mood,</l>
            <l>Still earless, netveless, blind, the eagles stood.</l>
            <l>And then we climbed the stair to a high door;</l>
            <l>A hundred horsemen on the basalt floor</l>
            <l>Beneath had paced content: we held our way</l>
            <l>And stood within: clothed in a misty ray</l>
            <l>I saw a foam-white seagull drift and float</l>
            <l>Under the roof, and with a straining throat</l>
            <l>Shouted, and hailed him: he hung there a star,</l>
            <l>For no man's cry shall ever mount so far;</l>
            <l>Not even your God could have thrown down that hall;</l>
            <l>Stabling His unloosed lightnings in their stall,</l>
            <l>He had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart,</l>
            <l>As though His hour were come.</l>
            <l>We sought the patt</l>
            <l>That was most distant from the door; green slime</l>
            <l>Made the way slippery, and time on time</l>
            <l>Showed prints of sea-born scales. while down</l>
            <l>through it</l>
            <l>The captive's journeys to and fro were writ</l>
            <l>Like a small river, and where feet touched came</l>
            <l>A momentary gleam of phosphorus flame.</l>
            <l>Under the deepest shadows of the hall</l>
            <l>That woman found a ring hung on the wall,</l>
            <l>And in the ring a torch, and with its flare</l>
            <l>Making a world about her in the air,</l>
            <l>Passed under the dim doorway, out of sight,</l>
            <l>And came again, holding a second light</l>
            <l>Burning between her fingers, and in mine</l>
            <l>Laid it and sighed: I held a sword whose shine</l>
            <l>No centuries could dim, and a word ran</l>
            <l>Thereon in Ogham letters, "Manannan';</l>
            <l>That sea-god's name, who in a deep content</l>
            <l>Sprang dripping, and, with captive demons sent</l>
            <l>Out of the sevenfold seas, built the dark hall</l>
            <l>Rooted in foam and clouds, and cried to all</l>
            <l>The mightier masters of a mightier race;</l>
            <l>And at his cry there came no milk-pale face</l>
            <l>Under a crown of thorns and dark with blood,</l>
            <l>But only exultant faces.</l>
            <l>Niamh stood</l>
            <l>With bowed head, trembling when the white blade</l>
            <l>shone,</l>
            <l>But she whose hours of tenderness were gone</l>
            <l>Had neither hope nor fear. I bade them hide</l>
            <l>Under the shadowS till the tumults died</l>
            <l>Of the loud-crashing and earth-shaking fight,</l>
            <l>Lest they should look upon some dreadful sight;</l>
            <l>And thrust the torch between the slimy flags.</l>
            <l>A dome made out of endless carven jags,</l>
            <l>Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face,</l>
            <l>Looked down on me; and in the self-same place</l>
            <l>I waited hour by hour, and the high dome,</l>
            <l>Windowless, pillarless, multitudinous home</l>
            <l>Of faces, waited; and the leisured gaze</l>
            <l>Was loaded with the memory of days</l>
            <l>Buried and mighty. When through the great door</l>
            <l>The dawn came in, and glimmered on the floor</l>
            <l>With a pale light, I journeyed round the hall</l>
            <l>And found a door deep sunken in the wall,</l>
            <l>The least of doors; beyond on a dim plain</l>
            <l>A little mnnel made a bubbling strain,</l>
            <l>And on the runnel's stony and bare edge</l>
            <l>A dusky demon dry as a withered sedge</l>
            <l>Swayed, crooning to himself an unknown tongue:</l>
            <l>In a sad revelry he sang and swung</l>
            <l>Bacchant and mournful, passing to and fro</l>
            <l>His hand along the runnel's side, as though</l>
            <l>The flowers still grew there: far on the sea's waste</l>
            <l>Shaking and waving, vapour vapour chased,</l>
            <l>While high frail cloudlets, fed with a green light,</l>
            <l>Like drifts of leaves, immovable and bright,</l>
            <l>Hung in the passionate dawn. He slowly turned:</l>
            <l>A demon's leisure: eyes, first white, now burned</l>
            <l>Like wings of kingfishers; and he arose</l>
            <l>Barking. We trampled up and down with blows</l>
            <l>Of sword and brazen battle-axe, while day</l>
            <l>Gave to high noon and noon to night gave way;</l>
            <l>And when he knew the sword of Manannan</l>
            <l>Amid the shades of night, he changed and ran</l>
            <l>Through many shapes; I lunged at the smooth throat</l>
            <l>Of a great eel; it changed, and I but smote</l>
            <l>A fir-tree roaring in its leafless top;</l>
            <l>And thereupon I drew the livid chop</l>
            <l>Of a drowned dripping body to my breast;</l>
            <l>Horror from horror grew; but when the west</l>
            <l>Had surged up in a plumy fire, I drave</l>
            <l>Through heart and spine; and cast him in the wave</l>
            <l>Lest Niamh shudder.</l>
            <l>Full of hope and dread</l>
            <l>Those two came carrying wine and meat and bread,</l>
            <l>And healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers</l>
            <l>That feed white moths by some De Danaan shrine;</l>
            <l>Then in that hall, lit by the dim sea-shine,</l>
            <l>We lay on skins of otters, and drank wine,</l>
            <l>Brewed by the sea-gods, from huge cups that lay</l>
            <l>Upon the lips of sea-gods in their day;</l>
            <l>And then on heaped-up skins of otters slept.</l>
            <l>And when the sun once more in saffron stept,</l>
            <l>Rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep,</l>
            <l>We sang the loves and angers without sleep,</l>
            <l>And all the exultant labours of the strong.</l>
            <l>But now the lying clerics murder song</l>
            <l>With barren words and flatteries of the weak.</l>
            <l>In what land do the powerless turn the beak</l>
            <l>Of ravening Sorrow, or the hand of Wrath?</l>
            <l>For all your croziers, they have left the path</l>
            <l>And wander in the storms and clinging snows,</l>
            <l>Hopeless for ever: ancient Oisin knows,</l>
            <l>For he is weak and poor and blind, and lies</l>
            <l>On the anvil of the world.</l>
            <l>S. Patrick. Be still: the skies</l>
            <l>Are choked with thunder, lightning, and fierce wind,</l>
            <l>For God has heard, and speaks His angry mind;</l>
            <l>Go cast your body on the stones and pray,</l>
            <l>For He has wrought midnight and dawn and day.</l>
            <l>Oisin. Saint, do you weep? I hear amid the thunder</l>
            <l>The Fenian horses; atmour torn asunder;</l>
            <l>Laughter and cries. The armies clash and shock,</l>
            <l>And now the daylight-darkening ravens flock.</l>
            <l>Cease, cease, O mournful, laughing Fenian horn!</l>
            <l>We feasted for three days. On the fourth morn</l>
            <l>I found, dropping sea-foam on the wide stair,</l>
            <l>And hung with slime, and whispering in his hair,</l>
            <l>That demon dull and unsubduable;</l>
            <l>And once more to a day-long battle fell,</l>
            <l>And at the sundown threw him in the surge,</l>
            <l>To lie until the fourth morn saw emerge</l>
            <l>His new-healed shape; and for a hundred years</l>
            <l>So watred, so feasted, with nor dreams nor fears,</l>
            <l>Nor languor nor fatigue: an endless feast,</l>
            <l>An endless war.</l>
            <l>The hundred years had ceased;</l>
            <l>I stood upon the stair: the surges bore</l>
            <l>A beech-bough to me, and my heart grew sore,</l>
            <l>Remembering how I had stood by white-haired Finn</l>
            <l>Under a beech at Almhuin and heard the thin</l>
            <l>Outcry of bats.</l>
            <l>And then young Niamh came</l>
            <l>Holding that horse, and sadly called my name;</l>
            <l>I mounted, and we passed over the lone</l>
            <l>And drifting greyness, while this monotone,</l>
            <l>Surly and distant, mixed inseparably</l>
            <l>Into the clangour of the wind and sea.</l>
            <l>"I hear my soul drop</l>
            <l>And Mananna's dark tower, stone after stone.</l>
            <l>Gather sea-slime and fall the seaward way,</l>
            <l>And the moon goad the waters night and day,</l>
            <l>That all be overthrown.</l>
            <l>"But till the moon has taken all, I wage</l>
            <l>War on the mightiest men under the skies,</l>
            <l>And they have fallen or fled, age after age.</l>
            <l>Light is man's love, and lighter is man's rage;</l>
            <l>His purpose drifts and dies.'</l>
            <l>And then lost Niamh murmured, "Love, we go</l>
            <l>To the Island of Forgetfulness, for lo!</l>
            <l>The Islands of Dancing and of Victories</l>
            <l>Are empty of all power.'</l>
            <l>"And which of these</l>
            <l>Is the Island of Content?'</l>
            <l>"None know,' she said;</l>
            <l>And on my bosom laid her weeping head.</l>
            <l>BOOK III</l>
            <l>FLED foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering</l>
            <l>and milky smoke,</l>
            <l>High as the Saddle-girth, covering away from our</l>
            <l>glances the tide;</l>
            <l>And those that fled, and that followed, from the foam-</l>
            <l>pale distance broke;</l>
            <l>The immortal desire of Immortals we saw in their</l>
            <l>faces, and sighed.</l>
            <l>I mused on the chase with the Fenians, and Bran,</l>
            <l>Sceolan, Lomair,</l>
            <l>And never a song sang Niamh, and over my finger-tips</l>
            <l>Came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist-</l>
            <l>cold hair,</l>
            <l>And now the warmth of sighs, and after the quiver of</l>
            <l>lips.</l>
            <l>Were we days long or hours long in riding, when,</l>
            <l>rolled in a grisly peace,</l>
            <l>An isle lay level before us, with dripping hazel and oak?</l>
            <l>And we stood on a sea's edge we saw not; for whiter</l>
            <l>than new-washed fleece</l>
            <l>Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering</l>
            <l>and milky smoke.</l>
            <l>And we rode on the plains of the sea's edge; the sea's</l>
            <l>edge barren and grey,</l>
            <l>Grey sand on the green of the grasses and over the</l>
            <l>dripping trees,</l>
            <l>Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would</l>
            <l>hasten away,</l>
            <l>Like an army of old men longing for rest from the</l>
            <l>moan of the seas.</l>
            <l>But the trees grew taller and closer, immense in their</l>
            <l>wrinkling bark;</l>
            <l>Dropping; a murmurous dropping; old silence and that</l>
            <l>one sound;</l>
            <l>For no live creatures lived there, no weasels moved in</l>
            <l>the dark:</l>
            <l>Long sighs arose in our spirits, beneath us bubbled the</l>
            <l>ground.</l>
            <l>And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the</l>
            <l>hollow night,</l>
            <l>For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of</l>
            <l>the world and the sun,</l>
            <l>Ceased on our hands and our faces, on hazel and oak</l>
            <l>leaf, the light,</l>
            <l>And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of</l>
            <l>the world was one.</l>
            <l>Till the horse gave a whinny; for, cumbrous with stems</l>
            <l>of the hazel and oak,</l>
            <l>A valley flowed down from his hoofs, and there in the</l>
            <l>long grass lay,</l>
            <l>Under the starlight and shadow, a monstrous slumber-</l>
            <l>ing folk,</l>
            <l>Their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and</l>
            <l>heaped in the way.</l>
            <l>And by them were arrow and war-axe, arrow and</l>
            <l>shield and blade;</l>
            <l>And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollow a child of</l>
            <l>three years old</l>
            <l>Could sleep on a couch of rushes, and all inwrought</l>
            <l>and inlaid,</l>
            <l>And more comely than man can make them with</l>
            <l>bronze and silver and gold.</l>
            <l>And each of the huge white creatures was huger than</l>
            <l>fourscore men;</l>
            <l>The tops of their ears were feathered, their hands were</l>
            <l>the claws of birds,</l>
            <l>And, shaking the plumes of the grasses and the leaves</l>
            <l>of the mural glen,</l>
            <l>The breathing came from those bodies, long warless,</l>
            <l>grown whiter than curds.</l>
            <l>The wood was so Spacious above them, that He who</l>
            <l>has stars for His flocks</l>
            <l>Could fondle the leaves with His fingers, nor go from</l>
            <l>His dew-cumbered skies;</l>
            <l>So long were they sleeping, the owls had builded their</l>
            <l>nests in their locks,</l>
            <l>Filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of</l>
            <l>eyes.</l>
            <l>And over the limbs and the valley the slow owls wan-</l>
            <l>dered and came,</l>
            <l>Now in a place of star-fire, and now in a shadow-place</l>
            <l>wide;</l>
            <l>And the chief of the huge white creatures, his knees in</l>
            <l>the soft star-flame,</l>
            <l>Lay loose in a place of shadow: we drew the reins by</l>
            <l>his side.</l>
            <l>Golden the nails of his bird-clawS, flung loosely along</l>
            <l>the dim ground;</l>
            <l>In one was a branch soft-shining with bells more many</l>
            <l>than sighs</l>
            <l>In midst of an old man's bosom; owls ruffling and</l>
            <l>pacing around</l>
            <l>Sidled their bodies against him, filling the shade with</l>
            <l>their eyes.</l>
            <l>And my gaze was thronged with the sleepers; no, not</l>
            <l>since the world began,</l>
            <l>In realms where the handsome were many, nor in</l>
            <l>glamours by demons flung,</l>
            <l>Have faces alive with such beauty been known to the</l>
            <l>salt eye of man,</l>
            <l>Yet weary with passions that faded when the sevenfold</l>
            <l>seas were young.</l>
            <l>And I gazed on the bell-branch, sleep's forebear, far</l>
            <l>sung by the Sennachies.</l>
            <l>I saw how those slumbererS, grown weary, there camp-</l>
            <l>ing in grasses deep,</l>
            <l>Of wars with the wide world and pacing the shores of</l>
            <l>the wandering seas,</l>
            <l>Laid hands on the bell-branch and swayed it, and fed</l>
            <l>of unhuman sleep.</l>
            <l>Snatching the horn of Niamh, I blew a long lingering</l>
            <l>note.</l>
            <l>Came sound from those monstrous sleepers, a sound like</l>
            <l>the stirring of flies.</l>
            <l>He, shaking the fold of his lips, and heaving the pillar</l>
            <l>of his throat,</l>
            <l>Watched me with mournful wonder out of the wells of</l>
            <l>his eyes.</l>
            <l>I cried, "Come out of the shadow, king of the nails of</l>
            <l>gold!</l>
            <l>And tell of your goodly household and the goodly</l>
            <l>works of your hands,</l>
            <l>That we may muse in the starlight and talk of the</l>
            <l>battles of old;</l>
            <l>Your questioner, Oisin, is worthy, he comes from the</l>
            <l>Fenian lands.'</l>
            <l>Half open his eyes were, and held me, dull with the</l>
            <l>smoke of their dreams;</l>
            <l>His lips moved slowly in answer, no answer out of</l>
            <l>them came;</l>
            <l>Then he swayed in his fingers the bell-branch, slow</l>
            <l>dropping a sound in faint streams</l>
            <l>Softer than snow-flakes in April and piercing the mar-</l>
            <l>row like flame.</l>
            <l>Wrapt in the wave of that music, with weariness more</l>
            <l>than of earth,</l>
            <l>The moil of my centuries filled me; and gone like a</l>
            <l>sea-covered stone</l>
            <l>Were the memories of the whole of my sorrow and the</l>
            <l>memories of the whole of my mirth,</l>
            <l>And a softness came from the starlight and filled me</l>
            <l>full to the bone.</l>
            <l>In the roots of the grasses, the sorrels, I laid my body</l>
            <l>as low;</l>
            <l>And the pearl-pale Niamh lay by me, her brow on the</l>
            <l>midst of my breast;</l>
            <l>And the horse was gone in the distance, and years after</l>
            <l>years 'gan flow;</l>
            <l>Square leaves of the ivy moved over us, binding us</l>
            <l>down to our rest.</l>
            <l>And, man of the many white croziers, a century there</l>
            <l>I forgot</l>
            <l>How the fetlocks drip blocd in the battle, when the</l>
            <l>fallen on fallen lie rolled;</l>
            <l>How the falconer follows the falcon in the weeds of</l>
            <l>the heron's plot,</l>
            <l>And the name of the demon whose hammer made</l>
            <l>Conchubar's sword-blade of old.</l>
            <l>And, man of the many white croziers, a century there</l>
            <l>I forgot</l>
            <l>That the spear-shaft is made out of ashwood, the shield</l>
            <l>out of osier and hide;</l>
            <l>How the hammers spring on the anvil, on the spear-</l>
            <l>head's burning spot;</l>
            <l>How the slow, blue-eyed oxen of Finn low sadly at</l>
            <l>evening tide.</l>
            <l>But in dreams, mild man of the croziers, driving the</l>
            <l>dust with their throngs,</l>
            <l>Moved round me, of seamen or landsmen, all who are</l>
            <l>winter tales;</l>
            <l>Came by me the kings of the Red Branch, with roaring</l>
            <l>of laughter and songs,</l>
            <l>Or moved as they moved once, love-making or piercing</l>
            <l>the tempest with sails.</l>
            <l>Came Blanid, Mac Nessa, tall Fergus who feastward of</l>
            <l>old time slunk,</l>
            <l>Cook Barach, the traitor; and warward, the spittle on</l>
            <l>his beard never dry,</l>
            <l>Dark Balor, as old as a forest, car-borne, his mighty</l>
            <l>head sunk</l>
            <l>Helpless, men lifting the lids of his weary and death-</l>
            <l>making eye.</l>
            <l>And by me, in soft red raiment, the Fenians moved in</l>
            <l>loud streams,</l>
            <l>And Grania, walking and smiling, sewed with her</l>
            <l>needle of bone.</l>
            <l>So lived I and lived not, so wrought I and wrought not,</l>
            <l>with creatures of dreams,</l>
            <l>In a long iron sleep, as a fish in the water goes dumb as</l>
            <l>a stone.</l>
            <l>At times our slumber was lightened. When the sun was</l>
            <l>on silver or gold;</l>
            <l>When brushed with the wings of the owls, in the dim-</l>
            <l>ness they love going by;</l>
            <l>When a glow-worm was green on a grass-leaf, lured</l>
            <l>from his lair in the mould;</l>
            <l>Half wakening, we lifted our eyelids, and gazed on the</l>
            <l>grass with a sigh.</l>
            <l>So watched I when, man of the croziers, at the heel of a</l>
            <l>century fell,</l>
            <l>Weak, in the midst of the meadow, from his miles in</l>
            <l>the midst of the air,</l>
            <l>A starling like them that forgathered 'neath a moon</l>
            <l>waking white as a shell</l>
            <l>When the Fenians made foray at morning with Bran,</l>
            <l>Sceolan, Lomair.</l>
            <l>I awoke: the strange horse without summons out of the</l>
            <l>distance ran,</l>
            <l>Thrusting his nose to my shoulder; he knew in his</l>
            <l>bosom deep</l>
            <l>That once more moved in my bosom the ancient sad-</l>
            <l>ness of man,</l>
            <l>And that I would leave the Immortals, their dimness,</l>
            <l>their dews dropping sleep.</l>
            <l>O, had you seen beautiful Niamh grow white as the</l>
            <l>waters are white,</l>
            <l>Lord of the croziers, you even had lifted your hands</l>
            <l>and wept:</l>
            <l>But, the bird in my fingers, I mounted, remembering</l>
            <l>alone that delight</l>
            <l>Of twilight and slumber were gone, and that hoofs im-</l>
            <l>patiently stept.</l>
            <l>I died, "O Niamh! O white one! if only a twelve-</l>
            <l>houred day,</l>
            <l>I must gaze on the beard of Finn, and move where the</l>
            <l>old men and young</l>
            <l>In the Fenians' dwellings of wattle lean on the chess-</l>
            <l>boards and play,</l>
            <l>Ah, sweet to me now were even bald Conan's slanderous</l>
            <l>tongue!</l>
            <l>"Like me were some galley forsaken far off in Meridian</l>
            <l>isle,</l>
            <l>Remembering its long-oared companions, sails turning</l>
            <l>to threadbare rags;</l>
            <l>No more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after</l>
            <l>mile,</l>
            <l>But to be amid shooting of flies and flowering of rushes</l>
            <l>and flags.'</l>
            <l>Their motionless eyeballs of spirits grown mild with</l>
            <l>mysterious thought,</l>
            <l>Watched her those seamless faces from the valley's</l>
            <l>glimmering girth;</l>
            <l>As she murmured, "O wandering Oisin, the strength</l>
            <l>of the bell-branch is naught,</l>
            <l>For there moves alive in your fingers the fluttering sad-</l>
            <l>ness of earth.</l>
            <l>"Then go through the lands in the saddle and see what</l>
            <l>the mortals do,</l>
            <l>And softly come to your Niamh over the tops of the</l>
            <l>tide;</l>
            <l>But weep for your Niamh, O Oisin, weep; for if only</l>
            <l>your shoe</l>
            <l>Brush lightly as haymouse earth's pebbles, you will</l>
            <l>come no more to my side.</l>
            <l>"O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to</l>
            <l>your rest?'</l>
            <l>I saw from a distant saddle; from the earth she made</l>
            <l>her moan:</l>
            <l>"I would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn,</l>
            <l>for breast unto breast</l>
            <l>We shall mingle no more, nor our gazes empty their</l>
            <l>sweetness lone</l>
            <l>"In the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits</l>
            <l>come.</l>
            <l>Were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon</l>
            <l>who sleeps on her nest,</l>
            <l>Nor lost in the star-fires and odours the sound of the</l>
            <l>sea's vague drum?</l>
            <l>O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to</l>
            <l>your rest?'</l>
            <l>The wailing grew distant; I rode by the woods of the</l>
            <l>wrinkling bark,</l>
            <l>Where ever is murmurous dropping, old silence and</l>
            <l>that one sound;</l>
            <l>For no live creatures live there, no weasels move in the</l>
            <l>dark:</l>
            <l>In a reverie forgetful of all things, over the bubbling'</l>
            <l>ground.</l>
            <l>And I rode by the plains of the sea's edge, where all is</l>
            <l>barren and grey,</l>
            <l>Grey sand on the green of the grasses and over the</l>
            <l>dripping trees,</l>
            <l>Dripping and doubling landward, as though they</l>
            <l>would hasten away',</l>
            <l>Like an army of old men longing for rest from the</l>
            <l>moan of the seas.</l>
            <l>And the winds made the sands on the sea's edge turning</l>
            <l>and turning go,</l>
            <l>As my mind made the names of the Fenians. Far from</l>
            <l>the hazel and oak,</l>
            <l>I rode away on the surges, where, high aS the saddle-</l>
            <l>bow,</l>
            <l>Fled foam underneath me, and round me, a wandering</l>
            <l>and milky smoke.</l>
            <l>Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled</l>
            <l>out of the vast,</l>
            <l>Snatching the bird in secret; nor knew I, embosomed</l>
            <l>apart,</l>
            <l>When they froze the cloth on my body like armour</l>
            <l>riveted fast,</l>
            <l>For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the</l>
            <l>gates of my heart.</l>
            <l>Till, fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of</l>
            <l>new-mown hay</l>
            <l>Came, and my forehead fell low, and my tears like</l>
            <l>berries fell down;</l>
            <l>Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far</l>
            <l>away,</l>
            <l>From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the</l>
            <l>shore-weeds brown.</l>
            <l>If I were as I once was, the strong hoofs crushing the</l>
            <l>sand and the shells,</l>
            <l>Coming out of the sea as the dawn comes, a chaunt of</l>
            <l>love on my lips,</l>
            <l>Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and</l>
            <l>wroth with the bells,</l>
            <l>I would leave no saint's head on his body from Rachlin</l>
            <l>to Bera of ships.</l>
            <l>Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a</l>
            <l>bridle-path</l>
            <l>Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattles and</l>
            <l>woodwork made,</l>
            <l>Your bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred</l>
            <l>cairn and the mth,</l>
            <l>And a small and a feeble populace stooping with mat-</l>
            <l>tock and spade,</l>
            <l>Or weeding or ploughing with faces a-shining with</l>
            <l>much-toil wet;</l>
            <l>While in this place and that place, with bodies un,</l>
            <l>glorious, their chieftains stood,</l>
            <l>Awaiting in patience the straw-death, croziered one,</l>
            <l>caught in your net:</l>
            <l>Went the laughter of scorn from my mouth like the</l>
            <l>roaring of wind in a wood.</l>
            <l>And before I went by them so huge and so speedy with</l>
            <l>eyes so bright,</l>
            <l>Came after the hard gaze of youth, or an old man lifted</l>
            <l>his head:</l>
            <l>And I rode and I rode, and I cried out, "The Fenians</l>
            <l>hunt wolves in the night,</l>
            <l>So sleep thee by daytime.' A voice cried, "The Fenians</l>
            <l>a long time are dead.'</l>
            <l>A whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway, the flesh</l>
            <l>of his face as dried grass,</l>
            <l>And in folds round his eyes and his mouth, he sad as a</l>
            <l>child without milk-</l>
            <l>And the dreams of the islands were gone, and I knew</l>
            <l>how men sorrow and pass,</l>
            <l>And their hound, and their horse, and their love, and</l>
            <l>their eyes that glimmer like silk.</l>
            <l>And wrapping my face in my hair, I murmured, "In</l>
            <l>old age they ceased';</l>
            <l>And my tears were larger than berries, and I mur-</l>
            <l>mured, "Where white clouds lie spread</l>
            <l>On Crevroe or broad Knockfefin, with many of old</l>
            <l>they feast</l>
            <l>On the floors of the gods.' He cried, "No, the gods a</l>
            <l>long time are dead.'</l>
            <l>And lonely and longing for Niamh, I shivered and</l>
            <l>turned me about,</l>
            <l>The heart in me longing to leap like a grasshopper into</l>
            <l>her heart;</l>
            <l>I turned and rode to the westward, and followed the</l>
            <l>sea's old shout</l>
            <l>Till I saw where Maeve lies sleeping till starlight and</l>
            <l>midnight part.</l>
            <l>And there at the foot of the mountain, two carried a</l>
            <l>sack full of sand,</l>
            <l>They bore it with staggering and sweating, but fell</l>
            <l>with their burden at length.</l>
            <l>Leaning down from the gem-studded saddle, I flung it</l>
            <l>five yards with my hand,</l>
            <l>With a sob for men waxing so weakly, a sob for the</l>
            <l>Fenians' old strength.</l>
            <l>The rest you have heard of, O croziered man; how,</l>
            <l>when divided the girth,</l>
            <l>I fell on the path, and the horse went away like a sum-</l>
            <l>mer fly;</l>
            <l>And my years three hundred fell on me, and I rose, and</l>
            <l>walked on the earth,</l>
            <l>A creeping old man, full of sleep, with the spittle on</l>
            <l>his beard never dry'.</l>
            <l>How the men of the sand-sack showed me a church</l>
            <l>with its belfry in air;</l>
            <l>Sorry place, where for swing of the war-axe in my dim</l>
            <l>eyes the crozier gleams;</l>
            <l>What place have Caoilte and Conan, and Bran, Sceolan,</l>
            <l>Lomair?</l>
            <l>Speak, you too are old with your memories, an old man</l>
            <l>surrounded with dreams.</l>
            <l>S. Patrick. Where the flesh of the footsole clingeth on</l>
            <l>the burning stones is their place;</l>
            <l>Where the demons whip them with wires on the</l>
            <l>burning stones of wide Hell,</l>
            <l>Watching the blessed ones move far off, and the</l>
            <l>smile on God's face,</l>
            <l>Between them a gateway of brass, and the howl of the</l>
            <l>angels who fell.</l>
            <l>Oisin. Put the staff in my hands; for I go to the Fenians,</l>
            <l>O cleric, to chaunt</l>
            <l>The war-songs that roused them of old; they will rise,</l>
            <l>making clouds with their Breath,</l>
            <l>Innumerable, singing, exultant; the clay underneath</l>
            <l>them shall pant,</l>
            <l>And demons be broken in pieces, and trampled</l>
            <l>beneath them in death.</l>
            <l>And demons afraid in their darkness; deep horror of</l>
            <l>eyes and of wings,</l>
            <l>Afraid, their ears on the earth laid, shall listen and</l>
            <l>rise up and weep;</l>
            <l>Hearing the shaking of shields and the quiver of</l>
            <l>stretched bowstrings,</l>
            <l>Hearing Hell loud with a murmur, as shouting and</l>
            <l>mocking we sweep.</l>
            <l>We will tear out the flaming stones, and batter the</l>
            <l>gateway of brass</l>
            <l>And enter, and none sayeth "No' when there enters</l>
            <l>the strongly armed guest;</l>
            <l>Make clean as a broom cleans, and march on as oxen</l>
            <l>move over young grass;</l>
            <l>Then feast, making converse of wars, and of old</l>
            <l>wounds, and turn to our rest.</l>
            <l>S. Patrick. On the flaming stones, without refuge, the</l>
            <l>limbs of the Fenians are tost;</l>
            <l>None war on the masters of Hell, who could break</l>
            <l>up the world in their rage;</l>
            <l>But kneel and wear out the flags and pray for your</l>
            <l>soul that is lost</l>
            <l>Through the demon love of its youth and its godless</l>
            <l>and passionate age.</l>
            <l>Oisin. Ah me! to be Shaken with coughing and broken</l>
            <l>with old age and pain,</l>
            <l>Without laughter, a show unto children, alone with</l>
            <l>remembrance and fear;</l>
            <l>All emptied of purple hours as a beggar's cloak in</l>
            <l>the rain,</l>
            <l>As a hay-cock out on the flood, or a wolf sucked</l>
            <l>under a weir.</l>
            <l>It were sad to gaze on the blessed and no man I loved</l>
            <l>of old there;</l>
            <l>I throw down the chain of small stones! when life in</l>
            <l>my body has ceased,</l>
            <l>I will go to Caoilte, and Conan, and Bran, Sceolan,</l>
            <l>Lomair,</l>
            <l>And dwell in the house of the Fenians, be they in</l>
            <l>flames or at feast.</l>

            <l>To some stringed instrument none there had seen,</l>
            <l>A wall behind his back, over his head</l>
            <l>A latticed window. His glance went up at time</l>
            <l>As though one listened there, and his voice sank</l>
            <l>Or let its meaning mix into the strings.</l>
            <l>MAEVE the great queen was pacing to and fro,</l>
            <l>Between the walls covered with beaten bronze,</l>
            <l>In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth,</l>
            <l>Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed</l>
            <l>Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes,</l>
            <l>Or on the benches underneath the walls,</l>
            <l>In comfortable sleep; all living slept</l>
            <l>But that great queen, who more than half the night</l>
            <l>Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.</l>
            <l>Though now in her old age, in her young age</l>
            <l>She had been beautiful in that old way</l>
            <l>That's all but gone; for the proud heart is gone,</l>
            <l>And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all</l>
            <l>But Soft beauty and indolent desire.</l>
            <l>She could have called over the rim of the world</l>
            <l>Whatever woman's lover had hit her fancy,</l>
            <l>And yet had been great-bodied and great-limbed,</l>
            <l>Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;</l>
            <l>And she'd had lucky eyes and high heart,</l>
            <l>And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax,</l>
            <l>At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,</l>
            <l>Sudden and laughing.</l>
            <l>O unquiet heart,</l>
            <l>Why do you praise another, praising her,</l>
            <l>As if there were no tale but your own tale</l>
            <l>Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?</l>
            <l>Have I not bid you tell of that great queen</l>
            <l>Who has been buried some two thousand years?</l>
            <l>When night was at its deepest, a wild goose</l>
            <l>Cried from the porter's lodge, and with long clamour</l>
            <l>Shook the ale-horns and shields upon their hooks;</l>
            <l>But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power</l>
            <l>Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;</l>
            <l>And wondering who of the many-changing Sidhe</l>
            <l>Had come as in the old times to counsel her,</l>
            <l>Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall, being old,</l>
            <l>To that small chamber by the outer gate.</l>
            <l>The porter slept, although he sat upright</l>
            <l>With still and stony limbs and open eyes.</l>
            <l>Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise</l>
            <l>Broke from his parted lips and broke again,</l>
            <l>She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,</l>
            <l>And shook him wide awake, and bid him say</l>
            <l>Who of the wandering many-changing ones</l>
            <l>Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say</l>
            <l>Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs</l>
            <l>More still than they had been for a good month,</l>
            <l>He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed</l>
            <l>nothing,</l>
            <l>He could remember when he had fine dreams.</l>
            <l>It was before the time of the great war</l>
            <l>Over the White-Horned Bull and the Brown Bull.</l>
            <l>She turned away; he turned again to sleep</l>
            <l>That no god troubled now, and, wondering</l>
            <l>What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,</l>
            <l>Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh</l>
            <l>Lifted the curtain of her sleeping-room,</l>
            <l>Remembering that she too had seemed divine</l>
            <l>To many thousand eyes, and to her own</l>
            <l>One that the generations had long waited</l>
            <l>That work too difficult for mortal hands</l>
            <l>Might be accomplished, Bunching the curtain up</l>
            <l>She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,</l>
            <l>And thought of days when he'd had a straight body,</l>
            <l>And of that famous Fergus, Nessa's husband,</l>
            <l>Who had been the lover of her middle life.</l>
            <l>Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,</l>
            <l>And not with his own voice or a man's voice,</l>
            <l>But with the burning, live, unshaken voice</l>
            <l>Of those that, it may be, can never age.</l>
            <l>He said, `High Queen of Cruachan and Magh Ai,</l>
            <l>A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.'</l>
            <l>And with glad voice Maeve answered him, `What king</l>
            <l>Of the far-wandering shadows has come to me,</l>
            <l>As in the old days when they would come and go</l>
            <l>About my threshold to counsel and to help?'</l>
            <l>The parted lips replied, `I seek your help,</l>
            <l>For I am Aengus, and I am crossed in love.'</l>
            <l>`How may a mortal whose life gutters out</l>
            <l>Help them that wander with hand clasping hand,</l>
            <l>Their haughty images that cannot wither,</l>
            <l>For all their beauty's like a hollow dream,</l>
            <l>Mirrored in streams that neither hail nor rain</l>
            <l>Nor the cold North has troubled?'</l>
            <l>He replied,</l>
            <l>`I am from those rivers and I bid you call</l>
            <l>The children of the Maines out of sleep,</l>
            <l>And set them digging under Bual's hill.</l>
            <l>We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,</l>
            <l>Will overthrow his shadows and carry off</l>
            <l>Caer, his blue-eyed daughter that I love.</l>
            <l>I helped your fathers when they built these walls,</l>
            <l>And I would have your help in my great need,</l>
            <l>Queen of high Cruachan.'</l>
            <l>`I obey your will</l>
            <l>With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:</l>
            <l>For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,</l>
            <l>Our giver of good counsel and good luck.'</l>
            <l>And with a groan, as if the mortal breath</l>
            <l>Could but awaken sadly upon lips</l>
            <l>That happier breath had moved, her husband turned</l>
            <l>Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;</l>
            <l>But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,</l>
            <l>Came to the threshold of the painted house</l>
            <l>Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,</l>
            <l>Until the pillared dark began to stir</l>
            <l>With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.</l>
            <l>She told them of the many-changing ones;</l>
            <l>And all that night, and all through the next day</l>
            <l>To middle night, they dug into the hill.</l>
            <l>At middle night great cats with silver claws,</l>
            <l>Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,</l>
            <l>Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds</l>
            <l>With long white bodies came out of the air</l>
            <l>Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</l>
            <l>The Maines' children dropped their spades, and stood</l>
            <l>With quaking joints and terror-stricken faces,</l>
            <l>Till Maeve called out, `These are but common men.</l>
            <l>The Maines' children have not dropped their spades</l>
            <l>Because Earth, crazy for its broken power,</l>
            <l>Casts up a Show and the winds answer it</l>
            <l>With holy shadows.' Her high heart was glad,</l>
            <l>And when the uproar ran along the grass</l>
            <l>She followed with light footfall in the midst,</l>
            <l>Till it died out where an old thorn-tree stood.</l>
            <l>Friend of these many years, you too had stood</l>
            <l>With equal courage in that whirling rout;</l>
            <l>For you, although you've not her wandering heart,</l>
            <l>Have all that greatness, and not hers alone,</l>
            <l>For there is no high story about queens</l>
            <l>In any ancient book but tells of you;</l>
            <l>And when I've heard how they grew old and died,</l>
            <l>Or fell into unhappiness, I've said,</l>
            <l>`She will grow old and die, and she has wept!'</l>
            <l>And when I'd write it out anew, the words,</l>
            <l>Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!</l>
            <l>Outrun the measure.</l>
            <l>I'd tell of that great queen</l>
            <l>Who stood amid a silence by the thorn</l>
            <l>Until two lovers came out of the air</l>
            <l>With bodies made out of soft fire. The one,</l>
            <l>About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings,</l>
            <l>Said, `Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks</l>
            <l>To Maeve and to Maeve's household, owing all</l>
            <l>In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.'</l>
            <l>Then Maeve: `O Aengus, Master of all lovers,</l>
            <l>A thousand years ago you held high talk</l>
            <l>With the first kings of many-pillared Cruachan.</l>
            <l>O when will you grow weary?'</l>
            <l>They had vanished,</l>
            <l>But our of the dark air over her head there came</l>
            <l>A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</l>

            <head>BAILE AND AILLINN</head>
            <l>1903</l>
            <l>ARGUMENT. Baile and Aillinn were lovers, but Aengus, the</l>
            <l>Master of Love, wishing them to he happy in his own land</l>
            <l>among the dead, told to each a story of the other's death, so</l>
            <l>that their hearts were broken and they died.</l>
            <l>I HARDLY hear the curlew cry,</l>
            <l>Nor thegrey rush when the wind is high,</l>
            <l>Before my thoughts begin to run</l>
            <l>On the heir of Uladh, Buan's son,</l>
            <l>Baile, who had the honey mouth;</l>
            <l>And that mild woman of the south,</l>
            <l>Aillinn, who was King Lugaidh's heir.</l>
            <l>Their love was never drowned in care</l>
            <l>Of this or that thing, nor grew cold</l>
            <l>Because their hodies had grown old.</l>
            <l>Being forbid to marry on earth,</l>
            <l>They blossomed to immortal mirth.</l>
            <l>About the time when Christ was born,</l>
            <l>When the long wars for the White Horn</l>
            <l>And the Brown Bull had not yet come,</l>
            <l>Young Baile Honey Mouth, whom some</l>
            <l>Called rather Baile Little-Land,</l>
            <l>Rode out of Emain with a band</l>
            <l>Of harpers and young men; and they</l>
            <l>Imagined, as they struck the way</l>
            <l>To many-pastured Muirthemne,</l>
            <l>That all things fell out happily,</l>
            <l>And there, for all that fools had said,</l>
            <l>Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</l>
            <l>They found an old man running there:</l>
            <l>He had ragged long grass-coloured hair;</l>
            <l>He had knees that stuck out of his hose;</l>
            <l>He had puddle-water in his shoes;</l>
            <l>He had half a cloak to keep him dry,</l>
            <l>Although he had a squirrel's eye.</l>
            <l>O wandering hirds and rushy beds,</l>
            <l>You put such folly in our heads</l>
            <l>With all this crying in the wind,</l>
            <l>No common love is to our mind,</l>
            <l>And our poor kate or Nan is less</l>
            <l>Than any whose unhappiness</l>
            <l>Awoke the harp-strings long ago.</l>
            <l>Yet they that know all things hut know</l>
            <l>That all this life can give us is</l>
            <l>A child's laughter, a woman's kiss.</l>
            <l>Who was it put so great a scorn</l>
            <l>In thegrey reeds that night and morn</l>
            <l>Are trodden and broken hy the herds,</l>
            <l>And in the light bodies of birds</l>
            <l>The north wind tumbles to and fro</l>
            <l>And pinches among hail and snow?</l>
            <l>That runner said: "I am from the south;</l>
            <l>I run to Baile Honey-Mouth,</l>
            <l>To tell him how the girl Aillinn</l>
            <l>Rode from the country of her kin,</l>
            <l>And old and young men rode with her:</l>
            <l>For all that country had been astir</l>
            <l>If anybody half as fair</l>
            <l>Had chosen a husband anywhere</l>
            <l>But where it could see her every day.</l>
            <l>When they had ridden a little way</l>
            <l>An old man caught the horse's head</l>
            <l>With: ""You must home again, and wed</l>
            <l>With somebody in your own land.''</l>
            <l>A young man cried and kissed her hand,</l>
            <l>""O lady, wed with one of us'';</l>
            <l>And when no face grew piteous</l>
            <l>For any gentle thing she spake,</l>
            <l>She fell and died of the heart-break.'</l>
            <l>Because a lover's heart s worn out,</l>
            <l>Being tumbled and blown about</l>
            <l>By its own blind imagining,</l>
            <l>And will believe that anything</l>
            <l>That is bad enough to be true, is true,</l>
            <l>Baile's heart was broken in two;</l>
            <l>And he, being laid upon green boughs,</l>
            <l>Was carried to the goodly house</l>
            <l>Where the Hound of Uladh sat before</l>
            <l>The brazen pillars of his door,</l>
            <l>His face bowed low to weep the end</l>
            <l>Of the harper's daughter and her friend</l>
            <l>For athough years had passed away</l>
            <l>He always wept them on that day,</l>
            <l>For on that day they had been betrayed;</l>
            <l>And now that Honey-Mouth is laid</l>
            <l>Under a cairn of sleepy stone</l>
            <l>Before his eyes, he has tears for none,</l>
            <l>Although he is carrying stone, but two</l>
            <l>For whom the cairn's but heaped anew.</l>
            <l>We hold, because our memory is</l>
            <l>Sofull of that thing and of this,</l>
            <l>That out of sight is out of mind.</l>
            <l>But the grey rush under the wind</l>
            <l>And the grey bird with crooked bill</l>
            <l>rave such long memories that they still</l>
            <l>Remember Deirdre and her man;</l>
            <l>And when we walk with Kate or Nan</l>
            <l>About the windy water-side,</l>
            <l>Our hearts can Fear the voices chide.</l>
            <l>How could we be so soon content,</l>
            <l>Who know the way that Naoise went?</l>
            <l>And they have news of Deirdre's eyes,</l>
            <l>Who being lovely was so wise — </l>
            <l>Ah! wise, my heart knows well how wise.</l>
            <l>Now had that old gaunt crafty one,</l>
            <l>Gathering his cloak about him, mn</l>
            <l>Where Aillinn rode with waiting-maids,</l>
            <l>Who amid leafy lights and shades</l>
            <l>Dreamed of the hands that would unlace</l>
            <l>Their bodices in some dim place</l>
            <l>When they had come to the matriage-bed,</l>
            <l>And harpers, pacing with high head</l>
            <l>As though their music were enough</l>
            <l>To make the savage heart of love</l>
            <l>Grow gentle without sorrowing,</l>
            <l>Imagining and pondering</l>
            <l>Heaven knows what calamity;</l>
            <l>"Another's hurried off,' cried he,</l>
            <l>"From heat and cold and wind and wave;</l>
            <l>They have heaped the stones above his grave</l>
            <l>In Muirthemne, and over it</l>
            <l>In changeless Ogham letters writ — </l>
            <l>Baile, that was of Rury's seed.</l>
            <l>But the gods long ago decreed</l>
            <l>No waiting-maid should ever spread</l>
            <l>Baile and Aillinn's marriage-bed,</l>
            <l>For they should clip and clip again</l>
            <l>Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.</l>
            <l>Therefore it is but little news</l>
            <l>That put this hurry in my shoes.'</l>
            <l>Then seeing that he scarce had spoke</l>
            <l>Before her love-worn heart had broke.</l>
            <l>He ran and laughed until he came</l>
            <l>To that high hill the herdsmen name</l>
            <l>The Hill Seat of Laighen, because</l>
            <l>Some god or king had made the laws</l>
            <l>That held the land together there,</l>
            <l>In old times among the clouds of the air.</l>
            <l>That old man climbed; the day grew dim;</l>
            <l>Two swans came flying up to him,</l>
            <l>Linked by a gold chain each to each,</l>
            <l>And with low murmuring laughing speech</l>
            <l>Alighted on the windy grass.</l>
            <l>They knew him: his changed body was</l>
            <l>Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings</l>
            <l>Were hovering over the harp-strings</l>
            <l>That Edain, Midhir's wife, had wove</l>
            <l>In the hid place, being crazed by love.</l>
            <l>What shall I call them? fish that swim,</l>
            <l>Scale rubbing scale where light is dim</l>
            <l>By a broad water-lily leaf;</l>
            <l>Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf</l>
            <l>Forgotten at the threshing-place;</l>
            <l>Or birds lost in the one clear space</l>
            <l>Of morning light in a dim sky;</l>
            <l>Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye,</l>
            <l>Or the door-pillars of one house,</l>
            <l>Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs</l>
            <l>That have one shadow on the ground;</l>
            <l>Or the two strings that made one sound</l>
            <l>Where that wise harper's finger ran.</l>
            <l>For this young girl and this young man</l>
            <l>Have happiness without an end,</l>
            <l>Because they have made so good a friend.</l>
            <l>They know all wonders, for they pass</l>
            <l>The towery gates of Gorias,</l>
            <l>And Findrias and Falias,</l>
            <l>And long-forgotten Murias,</l>
            <l>Among the giant kings whose hoard,</l>
            <l>Cauldron and spear and stone and sword,</l>
            <l>Was robbed before earth gave the wheat;</l>
            <l>Wandering from broken street to street</l>
            <l>They come where some huge watcher is,</l>
            <l>And tremble with their love and kiss.</l>
            <l>They know undying things, for they</l>
            <l>Wander where earth withers away,</l>
            <l>Though nothing troubles the great streams</l>
            <l>But light from the pale stars, and gleams</l>
            <l>From the holy orchards, where there is none</l>
            <l>But fruit that is of precious stone,</l>
            <l>Or apples of the sun and moon.</l>
            <l>What were our praise to them? They eat</l>
            <l>Quiet's wild heart, like daily meat;</l>
            <l>Who when night thickens are afloat</l>
            <l>On dappled skins in a glass boat,</l>
            <l>Far out under a windless sky;</l>
            <l>While over them birds of Aengus fly,</l>
            <l>And over the tiller and the prow,</l>
            <l>And waving white wings to and fro</l>
            <l>Awaken wanderings of light air</l>
            <l>To stir their coverlet and their hair.</l>
            <l>And poets found, old writers say,</l>
            <l>A yew tree where his body lay;</l>
            <l>But a wild apple hid the grass</l>
            <l>With its sweet blossom where hers was,</l>
            <l>And being in good heart, because</l>
            <l>A better time had come again</l>
            <l>After the deaths of many men,</l>
            <l>And that long fighting at the ford,</l>
            <l>They wrote on tablets of thin board,</l>
            <l>Made of the apple and the yew,</l>
            <l>All the love stories that they knew.</l>
            <l>Let rush and hird cry out their fill</l>
            <l>Of the harper's daughter if they will,</l>
            <l>Beloved, I am not afraid of her.</l>
            <l>She is not wiser nor lovelier,</l>
            <l>And you are more high of heart than she,</l>
            <l>For all her wanderings over-sea;</l>
            <l>But I'd have bird and rush forget</l>
            <l>Those other two; for never yet</l>
            <l>Has lover lived, but longed to wive</l>
            <l>Like them that are no more alive.</l>
            <l>THE SHADOWY WATERS</l>
            <l>1906</l>
            <l>TO</l>
            <l>LADY GREGORY</l>
            <l>I walked among the seven woods of Coole:</l>
            <l>Shan-walla, where a willow-hordered pond</l>
            <l>Gathers the wild duck from the winter dawn;</l>
            <l>Shady Kyle-dortha; sunnier Kyle-na-no,</l>
            <l>Where many hundred squirrels are as happy</l>
            <l>As though they had been hidden hy green houghs</l>
            <l>Where old age cannot find them; Paire-na-lee,</l>
            <l>Where hazel and ash and privet hlind the paths:</l>
            <l>Dim Pairc-na-carraig, where the wild bees fling</l>
            <l>Their sudden fragrances on the green air;</l>
            <l>Dim Pairc-na-tarav, where enchanted eyes</l>
            <l>Have seen immortal, mild, proud shadows walk;</l>
            <l>Dim Inchy wood, that hides badger and fox</l>
            <l>And marten-cat, and borders that old wood</l>
            <l>Wise Buddy Early called the wicked wood:</l>
            <l>Seven odours, seven murmurs, seven woods.</l>
            <l>I had not eyes like those enchanted eyes,</l>
            <l>Yet dreamed that beings happier than men</l>
            <l>Moved round me in the shadows, and at night</l>
            <l>My dreams were clown hy voices and by fires;</l>
            <l>And the images I have woven in this story</l>
            <l>Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters</l>
            <l>Moved round me in the voices and the fires,</l>
            <l>And more I may not write of, for they that cleave</l>
            <l>The waters of sleep can make a chattering tongue</l>
            <l>Heavy like stone, their wisdom being half silence.</l>
            <l>How shall I name you, immortal, mild, proud shadows?</l>
            <l>I only know that all we know comes from you,</l>
            <l>And that you come from Eden on flying feet.</l>
            <l>Is Eden far away, or do you hide</l>
            <l>From human thought, as hares and mice and coneys</l>
            <l>That run before the reaping-hook and lie</l>
            <l>In the last ridge of the barley? Do our woods</l>
            <l>And winds and ponds cover more quiet woods,</l>
            <l>More shining winds, more star-glimmering ponds?</l>
            <l>Is Eden out of time and out of space?</l>
            <l>And do you gather about us when pale light</l>
            <l>Shining on water and fallen among leaves,</l>
            <l>And winds blowing from flowers, and whirr of feathers</l>
            <l>And the green quiet, have uplifted the heart?</l>
            <l>I have made this poem for you, that men may read it</l>
            <l>Before they read of Forgael and Dectora,</l>
            <l>As men in the old times, before the harps began,</l>
            <l>Poured out wine for the high invisible ones.</l>
            <l>THE HARP OF AENGUS</l>
            <l>Edain came out of Midhir's hill, and lay</l>
            <l>Beside young Aengus in his tower of glass,</l>
            <l>Where time is drowned in odour-laden winds</l>
            <l>And Druid moons, and murmuring of boughs,</l>
            <l>And sleepy boughs, and boughs where apples made</l>
            <l>Of opal and ruhy and pale chrysolite</l>
            <l>Awake unsleeping fires; and wove seven strings,</l>
            <l>Sweet with all music, out of his long hair,</l>
            <l>Because her hands had been made wild by love.</l>
            <l>When Midhir's wife had changed her to a fly,</l>
            <l>He made a harp with Druid apple-wood</l>
            <l>That she among her winds might know he wept;</l>
            <l>And from that hour he has watched over none</l>
            <l>But faithful lovers.</l>

            <l>THE SHADOWY WATERS</l>
            <l>A DRAMATIC POEM</l>
            <l>The deck of an ancient ship. At the right of the stage is the mast,</l>
            <l>with a large square sail hiding a great deal of the sky and sea</l>
            <l>on that side. The tiller is at the left of the stage; it is a long oar</l>
            <l>coming through an opening in the bulwark. The deck rises in a</l>
            <l>series of steps behind the tiller, and the stern of the ship curves</l>
            <l>overhead. When the play opens there are four persons upon the</l>
            <l>deck. Aibric stands by the tiller. Forgael sleeps upon the raised</l>
            <l>portion of the deck towards the front of the stage. Two Sailors</l>
            <l>are standing near to the mast, on which a harp is hanging.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Has he not led us into these waste seas</l>
            <l>For long enough?</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. Aye, long and long enough.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. We have not come upon a shore or ship</l>
            <l>These dozen weeks.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. And I had thought to make</l>
            <l>A good round Sum upon this cruise, and turn — </l>
            <l>For I am getting on in life — to something</l>
            <l>That has less ups and downs than robbery.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I am so tired of being bachelor</l>
            <l>I could give all my heart to that Red Moll</l>
            <l>That had but the one eye.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. Can no bewitchment</l>
            <l>Transform these rascal billows into women</l>
            <l>That I may drown myself?</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Better steer home,</l>
            <l>Whether he will or no; and better still</l>
            <l>To take him while he sleeps and carry him</l>
            <l>And drop him from the gunnel.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. I dare not do it.</l>
            <l>Were't not that there is magic in his harp,</l>
            <l>I would be of your mind; but when he plays it</l>
            <l>Strange creatures flutter up before one's eyes,</l>
            <l>Or cry about one's ears.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Nothing to fear.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. Do you remember when we sank that</l>
            <l>galley</l>
            <l>At the full moon?</l>
            <l>First Sailor. He played all through the night.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. Until the moon had set; and when I looked</l>
            <l>Where the dead drifted, I could see a bird</l>
            <l>Like a grey gull upon the breast of each.</l>
            <l>While I was looking they rose hurriedly,</l>
            <l>And after circling with strange cries awhile</l>
            <l>Flew westward; and many a time since then</l>
            <l>I've heard a rustling overhead in the wind.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I saw them on that night as well as you.</l>
            <l>But when I had eaten and drunk myself asleep</l>
            <l>My courage came again.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. But that's not all.</l>
            <l>The other night, while he was playing it,</l>
            <l>A beautiful young man and girl came up</l>
            <l>In a white breaking wave; they had the look</l>
            <l>Of those that are alive for ever and ever.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I saw them, too, one night. Forgael was</l>
            <l>playing,</l>
            <l>And they were listening there beyond the sail.</l>
            <l>He could not see them, but I held out my hands</l>
            <l>To grasp the woman.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. You have dared to touch her?</l>
            <l>First Sailor. O she was but a shadow, and slipped from</l>
            <l>me.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. But were you not afraid?</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Why should I fear?</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. 'Twas Aengus and Edain, the wandering</l>
            <l>lovers,</l>
            <l>To whom all lovers pray.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. But what of that?</l>
            <l>A shadow does not carry sword or spear.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. My mother told me that there is not one</l>
            <l>Of the Ever-living half so dangerous</l>
            <l>As that wild Aengus. Long before her day</l>
            <l>He carried Edain off from a king's house,</l>
            <l>And hid her among fruits of jewel-stone</l>
            <l>And in a tower of glass, and from that day</l>
            <l>Has hated every man that's not in love,</l>
            <l>And has been dangerous to him.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I have heard</l>
            <l>He does not hate seafarers as he hates</l>
            <l>Peaceable men that shut the wind away,</l>
            <l>And keep to the one weary marriage-bed.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. I think that he has Forgael in his net,</l>
            <l>And drags him through the sea,</l>
            <l>First Sailor Well, net or none,</l>
            <l>I'd drown him while we have the chance to do it.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. It's certain I'd sleep easier o' nights</l>
            <l>If he were dead; but who will be our captain,</l>
            <l>Judge of the stars, and find a course for us?</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I've thought of that. We must have Aibric</l>
            <l>with us,</l>
            <l>For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.</l>
            <l>[Going towards Aibric.]</l>
            <l>Become our captain, Aibric. I am resolved</l>
            <l>To make an end of Forgael while he sleeps.</l>
            <l>There's not a man but will be glad of it</l>
            <l>When it is over, nor one to grumble at us.</l>
            <l>Aibric. You have taken pay and made your bargain for it.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. What good is there in this hard way of</l>
            <l>living,</l>
            <l>Unless we drain more flagons in a year</l>
            <l>And kiss more lips than lasting peaceable men</l>
            <l>In their long lives? Will you be of our troop</l>
            <l>And take the captain's share of everything</l>
            <l>And bring us into populous seas again?</l>
            <l>Aibric. Be of your troop! Aibric be one of you</l>
            <l>And Forgael in the other scale! kill Forgael,</l>
            <l>And he my master from my childhood up!</l>
            <l>If you will draw that sword out of its scabbard</l>
            <l>I'll give my answer.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. You have awakened him.</l>
            <l>[To Second Sailor.]</l>
            <l>We'd better go, for we have lost this chance.</l>
            <l>[They go out.]</l>
            <l>Forgael. Have the birds passed us? I could hear your</l>
            <l>voice,</l>
            <l>But there were others.</l>
            <l>Aibric. I have seen nothing pass.</l>
            <l>Forgael. You're certain of it? I never wake from sleep</l>
            <l>But that I am afraid they may have passed,</l>
            <l>For they're my only pilots. If I lost them</l>
            <l>Straying too far into the north or south,</l>
            <l>I'd never come upon the happiness</l>
            <l>That has been promised me. I have not seen them</l>
            <l>These many days; and yet there must be many</l>
            <l>Dying at every moment in the world,</l>
            <l>And flying towards their peace.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Put by these thoughts,</l>
            <l>And listen to me for a while. The sailors</l>
            <l>Are plotting for your death.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Have I not given</l>
            <l>More riches than they ever hoped to find?</l>
            <l>And now they will not follow, while I seek</l>
            <l>The only riches that have hit my fancy.</l>
            <l>Aibric. What riches can you find in this waste sea</l>
            <l>Where no ship sails, where nothing that's alive</l>
            <l>Has ever come but those man-headed birds,</l>
            <l>Knowing it for the world's end?</l>
            <l>Forgael. Where the world ends</l>
            <l>The mind is made unchanging, for it finds</l>
            <l>Miracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope,</l>
            <l>The flagstone under all, the fire of fires,</l>
            <l>The roots of the world.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Shadows before now</l>
            <l>Have driven travellers mad for their own sport.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their</l>
            <l>plot?</l>
            <l>Aibric. No, no, do not say that. You know right well</l>
            <l>That I will never lift a hand against you.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Why should you be more faithful than the rest,</l>
            <l>Being as doubtful?</l>
            <l>Aibric. I have called you master</l>
            <l>Too many years to lift a hand against you.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Maybe it is but natural to doubt me.</l>
            <l>You've never known, I'd lay a wager on it,</l>
            <l>A melancholy that a cup of wine,</l>
            <l>A lucky battle, or a woman's kiss</l>
            <l>Could not amend.</l>
            <l>Aibric. I have good spirits enough.</l>
            <l>Forgael. If you will give me all your mind awhile — </l>
            <l>All, all, the very bottom of the bowl — </l>
            <l>I'll show you that I am made differently,</l>
            <l>That nothing can amend it but these waters,</l>
            <l>Where I am rid of life — the events of the world — </l>
            <l>What do you call it? — that old promise-breaker,</l>
            <l>The cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering,</l>
            <l>`You will have all you have wished for when you have</l>
            <l>earned</l>
            <l>Land for your children or money in a pot.-</l>
            <l>And when we have it we are no happier,</l>
            <l>Because of that old draught under the door,</l>
            <l>Or creaky shoes. And at the end of all</l>
            <l>How are we better off than Seaghan the fool,</l>
            <l>That never did a hand's turn? Aibric! Aibric!</l>
            <l>We have fallen in the dreams the Ever-living</l>
            <l>Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world</l>
            <l>And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh,</l>
            <l>And find their laughter sweeter to the taste</l>
            <l>For that brief sighing.</l>
            <l>Aibric. If you had loved some woman — </l>
            <l>Forgael. You say that also? You have heard the voices,</l>
            <l>For that is what they say — all, all the shadows — </l>
            <l>Aengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers,</l>
            <l>And all the others; but it must be love</l>
            <l>As they have known it. Now the secret's out;</l>
            <l>For it is love that I am seeking for,</l>
            <l>But of a beautiful, unheard-of kind</l>
            <l>That is not in the world.</l>
            <l>Aibric. And yet the world</l>
            <l>Has beautiful women to please every man.</l>
            <l>Forgael. But he that gets their love after the fashion</l>
            <l>`Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope</l>
            <l>And bodily tenderness, and finds that even</l>
            <l>The bed of love, that in the imagination</l>
            <l>Had seemed to be the giver of all peace,</l>
            <l>Is no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,</l>
            <l>And as soon finished.</l>
            <l>Aibric. All that ever loved</l>
            <l>Have loved that way — there is no other way.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they</l>
            <l>believed there was some other near at hand,</l>
            <l>And almost wept because they could not find it.</l>
            <l>Aibric. When they have twenty years; in middle life</l>
            <l>They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,</l>
            <l>And let the dream go by.</l>
            <l>Forgael. It's not a dream,</l>
            <l>But the reality that makes our passion</l>
            <l>As a lamp shadow — no — no lamp, the sun.</l>
            <l>What the world's million lips are thirsting for</l>
            <l>Must be substantial somewhere.</l>
            <l>Aibric. I have heard the Druids</l>
            <l>Mutter such things as they awake from trance.</l>
            <l>It may be that the Ever-living know it — </l>
            <l>No mortal can.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Yes; if they give us help.</l>
            <l>Aibric. They are besotting you as they besot</l>
            <l>The crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows</l>
            <l>That he has been all night upon the hills,</l>
            <l>Riding to hurley, or in the battle-host</l>
            <l>With the Ever-living.</l>
            <l>Forgael. What if he speak the truth,</l>
            <l>And for a dozen hours have been a part</l>
            <l>Of that more powerful life?</l>
            <l>Aibric, His wife knows better.</l>
            <l>Has she not seen him lying like a log,</l>
            <l>Or fumbling in a dream about the house?</l>
            <l>And if she hear him mutter of wild riders,</l>
            <l>She knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing</l>
            <l>That set him to the fancy.</l>
            <l>Forgael. All would be well</l>
            <l>Could we but give us wholly to the dreams,</l>
            <l>And get into their world that to the sense</l>
            <l>Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly</l>
            <l>Among substantial things; for it is dreams</l>
            <l>That lift us to the flowing, changing world</l>
            <l>That the heart longs for. What is love itself,</l>
            <l>Even though it be the lightest of light love,</l>
            <l>But dreams that hurry from beyond the world</l>
            <l>To make low laughter more than meat and drink,</l>
            <l>Though it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,</l>
            <l>Could we but mix ourselves into a dream,</l>
            <l>Not in its image on the mirror!</l>
            <l>Aibric. While</l>
            <l>We're in the body that's impossible.</l>
            <l>Forgael. And yet I cannot think they're leading me</l>
            <l>To death; for they that promised to me love</l>
            <l>As those that can outlive the moon have known it, '</l>
            <l>Had the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,</l>
            <l>Into their shining limbs — I've had great teachers.</l>
            <l>Aengus and Edain ran up out of the wave — </l>
            <l>You'd never doubt that it was life they promised</l>
            <l>Had you looked on them face to face as I did,</l>
            <l>With so red lips, and running on such feet,</l>
            <l>And having such wide-open, shining eyes.</l>
            <l>Aibric. It's certain they are leading you to death.</l>
            <l>None but the dead, or those that never lived,</l>
            <l>Can know that ecstasy. Forgael! Forgael!</l>
            <l>They have made you follow the man-headed birds,</l>
            <l>And you have told me that their journey lies</l>
            <l>Towards the country of the dead.</l>
            <l>Forgael. What matter</l>
            <l>If I am going to my death? — for there,</l>
            <l>Or somewhere, I shall find the love they have</l>
            <l>promised.</l>
            <l>That much is certain. I shall find a woman.</l>
            <l>One of the Ever-living, as I think — </l>
            <l>One of the Laughing People — and she and I</l>
            <l>Shall light upon a place in the world's core,</l>
            <l>Where passion grows to be a changeless thing,</l>
            <l>Like charmed apples made of chrysoprase,</l>
            <l>Or chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysolite;</l>
            <l>And there, in juggleries of sight and sense,</l>
            <l>Become one movement, energy, delight,</l>
            <l>Until the overburthened moon is dead.</l>
            <l>[A number of Sailors enter hurriedly.]</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice!</l>
            <l>And we are almost on her!</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. We had not known</l>
            <l>But for the ambergris and sandalwood.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. NO; but opoponax and cinnamon.</l>
            <l>Forgael [taking the tiller from Aibric]. The Ever-living have</l>
            <l>kept my bargain for me,</l>
            <l>And paid you on the nail.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Take up that rope</l>
            <l>To make her fast while we are plundering her.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. There is a king and queen upon her deck,</l>
            <l>And where there is one woman there'll be others.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Speak lower, or they'll hear.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. They cannot hear;</l>
            <l>They are too busy with each other. Look!</l>
            <l>He has stooped down and kissed her on the lips.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. When she finds out we have better men</l>
            <l>aboard</l>
            <l>She may not be too sorry in the end.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens</l>
            <l>Care more about the kegs of silver and gold</l>
            <l>And the high fame that come to them in marriage,</l>
            <l>Than a strong body and a ready hand.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. There's nobody is natural but a robber,</l>
            <l>And that is why the world totters about</l>
            <l>Upon its bandy legs.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Run at them now,</l>
            <l>And overpower the crew while yet asleep!</l>
            <l>[The Sailors go out.]</l>
            <l>[Voices and the clashing of swords are heard from the</l>
            <l>other ship, which cannot be seen because of the sail.]</l>
            <l>A Voice. Armed men have come upon us! O I am slain!</l>
            <l>Another Voice. Wake all below!</l>
            <l>Another Voice. Why have you broken our sleep?</l>
            <l>First Voice. Armed men have come upon us! O I am</l>
            <l>slain!</l>
            <l>Forgael [who has remained at the tiller]. There! there they</l>
            <l>come! Gull, gannet, or diver,</l>
            <l>But with a man's head, or a fair woman's,</l>
            <l>They hover over the masthead awhile</l>
            <l>To wait their Fiends; but when their friends have</l>
            <l>come</l>
            <l>They'll fly upon that secret way of theirs.</l>
            <l>One — and one — a couple — five together;</l>
            <l>And I will hear them talking in a minute.</l>
            <l>Yes, voices! but I do not catch the words.</l>
            <l>Now I can hear. There's one of them that says,</l>
            <l>`How light we are, now we are changed to birds!'</l>
            <l>Another answers, `Maybe we shall find</l>
            <l>Our heart's desire now that we are so light.'</l>
            <l>And then one asks another how he died,</l>
            <l>And says, `A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.-</l>
            <l>And now they all wheel suddenly and fly</l>
            <l>To the other side, and higher in the air.</l>
            <l>And now a laggard with a woman's head</l>
            <l>Comes crying, `I have run upon the sword.</l>
            <l>I have fled to my beloved in the air,</l>
            <l>In the waste of the high air, that we may wander</l>
            <l>Among the windy meadows of the dawn.'</l>
            <l>But why are they still waiting? why are they</l>
            <l>Circling and circling over the masthead?</l>
            <l>What power that is more mighty than desire</l>
            <l>To hurry to their hidden happiness</l>
            <l>Withholds them now? Have the Ever-living Ones</l>
            <l>A meaning in that circling overhead?</l>
            <l>But what's the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you</l>
            <l>linger there?</l>
            <l>Why linger? Run to your desire,</l>
            <l>Are you not happy winged bodies now?</l>
            <l>[His voice sinks again.]</l>
            <l>Being too busy in the air and the high air,</l>
            <l>They cannot hear my voice; but what's the meaning?</l>
            <l>[The Sailors have returned. Dectora is with them.]</l>
            <l>Forgael [turning and seeing her]. Why are you standing</l>
            <l>with your eyes upon me?</l>
            <l>You are not the world's core. O no, no, no!</l>
            <l>That cannot be the meaning of the birds.</l>
            <l>You are not its core. My teeth are in the world,</l>
            <l>But have not bitten yet.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I am a queen,</l>
            <l>And ask for satisfaction upon these</l>
            <l>Who have slain my husband and laid hands upon me.</l>
            <l>[Breaking loose from the Sailors who are holding her.]</l>
            <l>Let go my hands!</l>
            <l>Forgael. Why do you cast a shadow?</l>
            <l>Where do you come from? Who brought you to this</l>
            <l>place?</l>
            <l>They would not send me one that casts a shadow.</l>
            <l>Dectora. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships,</l>
            <l>And drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations,</l>
            <l>And blew me hither to my lasting sorrow,</l>
            <l>Had drowned me also. But, being yet alive,</l>
            <l>I ask a fitting punishment for all</l>
            <l>That raised their hands against him.</l>
            <l>Forgael. There are some</l>
            <l>That weigh and measure all in these waste seas — </l>
            <l>They that have all the wisdom that's in life,</l>
            <l>And all that prophesying images</l>
            <l>Made of dim gold rave out in secret tombs;</l>
            <l>They have it that the plans of kings and queens</l>
            <l>But laughter and tears — laughter, laughter, and tears;</l>
            <l>That every man should carry his own soul</l>
            <l>Upon his shoulders.</l>
            <l>Dectora. You've nothing but wild words,</l>
            <l>And I would know if you will give me vengeance.</l>
            <l>Forgael. When she finds out I will not let her go — </l>
            <l>When she knows that.</l>
            <l>Dectora. What is it that you are muttering — </l>
            <l>That you'll not let me go? I am a queen.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Although you are more beautiful than any,</l>
            <l>I almost long that it were possible;</l>
            <l>But if I were to put you on that ship,</l>
            <l>With sailors that were sworn to do your will,</l>
            <l>And you had spread a sail for home, a wind</l>
            <l>Would rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge</l>
            <l>It had washed among the stars and put them out,</l>
            <l>And beat the bulwark of your ship on mine,</l>
            <l>Until you stood before me on the deck — </l>
            <l>As now.</l>
            <l>Dectora. Does wandering in these desolate seas</l>
            <l>And listening to the cry of wind and wave</l>
            <l>Bring madness?</l>
            <l>Forgael. Queen, I am not mad.</l>
            <l>Dectora. Yet say</l>
            <l>That unimaginable storms of wind and wave</l>
            <l>Would rise against me.</l>
            <l>Forgael. No, I am not mad — </l>
            <l>If it be not that hearing messages</l>
            <l>From lasting watchers, that outlive the moon,</l>
            <l>At the most quiet midnight is to be stricken.</l>
            <l>Dectora. And did those watchers bid you take me</l>
            <l>captive?</l>
            <l>Forgael. Both you and I are taken in the net.</l>
            <l>It was their hands that plucked the winds awake</l>
            <l>And blew you hither; and their mouths have</l>
            <l>promised</l>
            <l>I shall have love in their immortal fashion;</l>
            <l>And for this end they gave me my old harp</l>
            <l>That is more mighty than the sun and moon,</l>
            <l>Or than the shivering casting-net of the stars,</l>
            <l>That none might take you from me.</l>
            <l>Dectora [first trembling back from the mast where the harp is,</l>
            <l>and then laughing]. For a moment</l>
            <l>Your raving of a message and a harp</l>
            <l>More mighty than the stars half troubled me,</l>
            <l>But all that's raving. Who is there can compel</l>
            <l>The daughter and the granddaughter of kings</l>
            <l>To be his bedfellow?</l>
            <l>Forgael. Until your lips</l>
            <l>Have called me their beloved, I'll not kiss them.</l>
            <l>Dectora. My husband and my king died at my feet,</l>
            <l>And yet you talk of love.</l>
            <l>Forgael. The movement of time</l>
            <l>Is shaken in these seas, and what one does</l>
            <l>One moment has no might upon the moment</l>
            <l>That follows after.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I understand you now.</l>
            <l>You have a Druid craft of wicked sound</l>
            <l>Wrung from the cold women of the sea — </l>
            <l>A magic that can call a demon up,</l>
            <l>Until my body give you kiss for kiss.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Your soul shall give the kiss.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I am not afraid,</l>
            <l>While there's a rope to run into a noose</l>
            <l>Or wave to drown. But I have done with words,</l>
            <l>And I would have you look into my face</l>
            <l>And know that it is fearless.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Do what you will,</l>
            <l>For neither I nor you can break a mesh</l>
            <l>Of the great golden net that is about us.</l>
            <l>Dectora. There's nothing in the world that's worth a</l>
            <l>fear.</l>
            <l>[She passes Forgael and stands for a moment looking into</l>
            <l>his face.]</l>
            <l>I have good reason for that thought.</l>
            <l>[She runs suddenly on to the raised part of the poop.]</l>
            <l>And now</l>
            <l>I can put fear away as a queen should.</l>
            <l>[She mounts on to the bulwark and turns towards</l>
            <l>Forgael.]</l>
            <l>Fool, fool! Although you have looked into my face</l>
            <l>You do not see my purpose. I shall have gone</l>
            <l>Before a hand can touch me.</l>
            <l>Forgael [folding his arms]. My hands are still;</l>
            <l>The Ever-living hold us. Do what you will,</l>
            <l>You cannot leap out of the golden net.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. No need to drown, for, if you will pardon</l>
            <l>us</l>
            <l>And measure out a course and bring us home,</l>
            <l>We'll put this man to death.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I promise it.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. There is none to take his side.</l>
            <l>Aibric. I am on his side,</l>
            <l>I'll strike a blow for him to give him time</l>
            <l>To cast his dreams away.</l>
            <l>[Aibric goes in front of Forgael with drawn sword. For-</l>
            <l>gael takes the harp.]</l>
            <l>First Sailor. No other 'll do it.</l>
            <l>[The Sailors throw Aibric on one side. He falls and lies</l>
            <l>upon the deck. They lift their swords to strike Forgael,</l>
            <l>who is about to play the harp. The stage begins to</l>
            <l>darken. The Sailors hesitate in fear.]</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. He has put a sudden darkness over the</l>
            <l>moon.</l>
            <l>Dectora. Nine swords with handles of rhinoceros horn</l>
            <l>To him that strikes him first!</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I will strike him first.</l>
            <l>[He goes close up to Forgael with his sword lifted.]</l>
            <l>[Shrinking back.] He has caught the crescent moon out</l>
            <l>of the sky,</l>
            <l>And carries it between us.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. Holy fire</l>
            <l>To burn us to the marrow if we strike.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I'll give a golden galley full of fruit,</l>
            <l>That has the heady flavour of new wine,</l>
            <l>To him that wounds him to the death.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I'll do it.</l>
            <l>For all his spells will vanish when he dies,</l>
            <l>Having their life in him.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. Though it be the moon</l>
            <l>That he is holding up between us there,</l>
            <l>I will strike at him.</l>
            <l>The Others. And I! And I! And I!</l>
            <l>[Forgael plays the harp.]</l>
            <l>First Sailor [falling into a dream suddenly. But you were</l>
            <l>saying there is somebody</l>
            <l>Upon that other ship we are to wake.</l>
            <l>You did not know what brought him to his end,</l>
            <l>But it was sudden.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. You are in the right;</l>
            <l>I had forgotten that we must go wake him.</l>
            <l>Dectora. He has flung a Druid spell upon the air,</l>
            <l>And set you dreaming.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. How can we have a wake</l>
            <l>When we have neither brown nor yellow ale?</l>
            <l>First Sailor. I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.</l>
            <l>Third Sailor. How can we raise the keen that do not</l>
            <l>know</l>
            <l>What name to call him by?</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Come to his ship.</l>
            <l>His name will come into our thoughts in a minute.</l>
            <l>I know that he died a thousand years ago,</l>
            <l>And has not yet been waked.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor [beginning to keen]. Ohone! O! O! O!</l>
            <l>The yew-bough has been broken into two,</l>
            <l>And all the birds are scattered.</l>
            <l>All the Sailors. O! O! O! O!</l>
            <l>[They go out keening.]</l>
            <l>Dectora. Protect me now, gods that my people swear by.</l>
            <l>[Aibric has risen from the deck where he had fallen. He</l>
            <l>has begun looking for his sword as if in a dream.]</l>
            <l>Aibric. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand</l>
            <l>When I first heard the news? Ah, there it is!</l>
            <l>[He goes dreamily towards the sword, but Dectora runs at</l>
            <l>it and takes it up before he can reach it.]</l>
            <l>Aibric [sleepily]. Queen, give it me.</l>
            <l>Dectora. No, I have need of it.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it.</l>
            <l>Now that he's dead I have no need of it,</l>
            <l>For everything is gone.</l>
            <l>A Sailor [calling from the other ship]. Come hither, Aibric,</l>
            <l>And tell me who it is that we are waking.</l>
            <l>Aibric [half to Dectora, half to himself]. What name had</l>
            <l>that dead king? Arthur of Britain?</l>
            <l>No, no — not Arthur. I remember now.</l>
            <l>It was golden-armed Iollan, and he died</l>
            <l>Broken-hearted, having lost his queen</l>
            <l>Through wicked spells. That is not all the tale,</l>
            <l>For he was killed. O! O! O! O! O! O!</l>
            <l>For golden-armed Iollan has been killed.</l>
            <l>[He goes out.]</l>
            <l>[While he has been speaking, and through part of what</l>
            <l>follows, one hears the wailing of the Sailors from the</l>
            <l>other ship. Dectora stands with the sword lifted in</l>
            <l>front of Forgael.]</l>
            <l>Dectora. I will end all your magic on the instant.</l>
            <l>[Her voice becomes dreamy, and she lowers the sword</l>
            <l>slowly, and finally lets it fall. She spreads out her hair.</l>
            <l>She takes off her crown and lays it upon the deck.]</l>
            <l>This sword is to lie beside him in the grave.</l>
            <l>It was in all his battles. I will spread my hair,</l>
            <l>And wring my hands, and wail him bitterly,</l>
            <l>For I have heard that he was proud and laughing,</l>
            <l>Blue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet,</l>
            <l>And that he died a thousand years ago.</l>
            <l>O; O! O! O!</l>
            <l>[Forgael changes the tune.]</l>
            <l>But no, that is not it.</l>
            <l>They killed him at my feet. O! O! O! O!</l>
            <l>For golden-armed Iollan that I loved-</l>
            <l>But what is it that made me say I loved him?</l>
            <l>It was that harper put it in my thoughts,</l>
            <l>But it is true. Why did they run upon him,</l>
            <l>And beat the golden helmet with their swords?</l>
            <l>Forgael. Do you not know me, lady? I am he</l>
            <l>That you are weeping for.</l>
            <l>Dectora. No, for he is dead.</l>
            <l>O! O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan.</l>
            <l>Forgael. It was so given out, but I will prove</l>
            <l>That the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy</l>
            <l>Have buried nothing but my golden arms.</l>
            <l>Listen to that low-laughing string of the moon</l>
            <l>And you will recollect my face and voice,</l>
            <l>For you have listened to me playing it</l>
            <l>These thousand years.</l>
            <l>[He starts up, listening to the birds. The harp slips from</l>
            <l>his hands, and remains leaning against the bulwarks</l>
            <l>behind him.]</l>
            <l>What are the birds at there?</l>
            <l>Why are they all a-flutter of a sudden?</l>
            <l>What are you calling out above the mast?</l>
            <l>If railing and reproach and mockery</l>
            <l>Because I have awakened her to love</l>
            <l>By magic strings, I'll make this answer to it:</l>
            <l>Being driven on by voices and by dreams</l>
            <l>That were clear messages from the Ever-living,</l>
            <l>I have done right. What could I but obey?</l>
            <l>And yet you make a clamour of reproach.</l>
            <l>Dectora [laughing]. Why, it's a wonder out of reckoning</l>
            <l>That I should keen him from the full of the moon</l>
            <l>To the horn, and he be hale and hearty.</l>
            <l>Forgael. How have I wronged her now that she is merry?</l>
            <l>But no, no, no! your cry is not against me.</l>
            <l>You know the counsels of the Ever-living,</l>
            <l>And all that tossing of your wings is joy,</l>
            <l>And all that murmuring's but a marriage-song;</l>
            <l>But if it be reproach, I answer this:</l>
            <l>There is not one among you that made love</l>
            <l>by any other means. You call it passion,</l>
            <l>Consideration, generosity;</l>
            <l>But it was all deceit, and flattery</l>
            <l>To win a woman in her own despite,</l>
            <l>For love is war, and there is hatred in it;</l>
            <l>And if you say that she came willingly — </l>
            <l>Dectora. Why do you turn away and hide your face,</l>
            <l>That I would look upon for ever?</l>
            <l>Forgael. My grief!</l>
            <l>Dectora. Have I not loved you for a thousand years?</l>
            <l>Forgael. I never have been golden-armed Iollan.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I do not understand. I know your face</l>
            <l>Better than my own hands.</l>
            <l>Forgael. I have deceived you</l>
            <l>Out of all reckoning.</l>
            <l>Dectora. Is it not true</l>
            <l>That you were born a thousand years ago,</l>
            <l>In islands where the children of Aengus wind</l>
            <l>In happy dances under a windy moon,</l>
            <l>And that you'll bring me there?</l>
            <l>Forgael. I have deceived you;</l>
            <l>I have deceived you utterly.</l>
            <l>Dectora. How can that be?</l>
            <l>Is it that though your eyes are full of love</l>
            <l>Some other woman has a claim on you,</l>
            <l>And I've but half!</l>
            <l>Forgael. O no!</l>
            <l>Dectora. And if there is,</l>
            <l>If there be half a hundred more, what matter?</l>
            <l>I'll never give another thought to it;</l>
            <l>No, no, nor half a thought; but do not speak.</l>
            <l>Women are hard and proud and stubborn-hearted,</l>
            <l>Their heads being turned with praise and flattery;</l>
            <l>And that is why their lovers are afraid</l>
            <l>To tell them a plain story.</l>
            <l>Forgael. That's not the story;</l>
            <l>But I have done so great a wrong against you,</l>
            <l>There is no measure that it would not burst.</l>
            <l>I will confess it all.</l>
            <l>Dectora. What do I care,</l>
            <l>Now that my body has begun to dream,</l>
            <l>And you have grown to be a burning sod</l>
            <l>In the imagination and intellect?</l>
            <l>If something that's most fabulous were true — </l>
            <l>If you had taken me by magic spells,</l>
            <l>And killed a lover or husband at my feet — </l>
            <l>I would not let you speak, for I would know</l>
            <l>That it was yesterday and not to-day</l>
            <l>I loved him; I would cover up my ears,</l>
            <l>As I am doing now. [A pause.] Why do you weep?</l>
            <l>Forgael. I weep because I've nothing for your eyes</l>
            <l>But desolate waters and a battered ship.</l>
            <l>Dectora. O why do you not lift your eyes to mine?</l>
            <l>Forgael. I weep — I weep because bare night's above,</l>
            <l>And not a roof of ivory and gold.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I would grow jealous of the ivory roof,</l>
            <l>And strike the golden pillars with my hands.</l>
            <l>I would that there was nothing in the world</l>
            <l>But my beloved — that night and day had perished,</l>
            <l>And all that is and all that is to be,</l>
            <l>All that is not the meeting of our lips.</l>
            <l>Forgael. You turn away. Why do you turn away?</l>
            <l>Am I to fear the waves, or is the moon</l>
            <l>My enemy?</l>
            <l>Dectora. I looked upon the moon,</l>
            <l>Longing to knead and pull it into shape</l>
            <l>That I might lay it on your head as a crown.</l>
            <l>But now it is your thoughts that wander away,</l>
            <l>For you are looking at the sea. Do you not know</l>
            <l>How great a wrong it is to let one's thought</l>
            <l>Wander a moment when one is in love?</l>
            <l>[He has moved away. She follows him. He is looking out</l>
            <l>over the sea, shading his eyes.]</l>
            <l>Why are you looking at the sea?</l>
            <l>Forgael. Look there!</l>
            <l>Dectora. What is there but a troop of ash-grey birds</l>
            <l>That fly into the west?</l>
            <l>Forgael. But listen, listen!</l>
            <l>Dectora. What is there but the crying of the birds?</l>
            <l>Forgael. If you'll but listen closely to that crying</l>
            <l>You'll hear them calling out to one another</l>
            <l>With human voices</l>
            <l>Dectora. O, I can hear them now.</l>
            <l>What are they? Unto what country do they fly?</l>
            <l>Forgael. To unimaginable happiness.</l>
            <l>They have been circling over our heads in the air,</l>
            <l>But now that they have taken to the road</l>
            <l>We have to follow, for they are our pilots;</l>
            <l>And though they're but the colour of grey ash,</l>
            <l>They're crying out, could you but hear their words,</l>
            <l>`There is a country at the end of the world</l>
            <l>Where no child's born but to outlive the moon.'</l>
            <l>[The Sailors come in with Aibric. They are in great</l>
            <l>excitement.]</l>
            <l>First Sailor. The hold is full of treasure.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. Full to the hatches.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Treasure on treasure.</l>
            <l>Third Sailor. Boxes of precious spice.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. Ivory images with amethyst eyes.</l>
            <l>Third Sailor. Dragons with eyes of ruby.</l>
            <l>First Sailor. The whole ship</l>
            <l>Flashes as if it were a net of herrings.</l>
            <l>Third Sailor. Let's home; I'd give some rubies to a</l>
            <l>woman.</l>
            <l>Second Sailor. There's somebody I'd give the amethyst</l>
            <l>eyes to.</l>
            <l>Aibric [silencing them with a gesture]. We would return to</l>
            <l>our own country, Forgael,</l>
            <l>For we have found a treasure that's so great</l>
            <l>Imagination cannot reckon it.</l>
            <l>And having lit upon this woman there,</l>
            <l>What more have you to look for on the seas?</l>
            <l>Forgael. I cannot — I am going on to the end.</l>
            <l>As for this woman, I think she is coming with me.</l>
            <l>Aibric. The Ever-living have made you mad; but no,</l>
            <l>It was this woman in her woman's vengeance</l>
            <l>That drove you to it, and I fool enough</l>
            <l>To fancy that she'd bring you home again.</l>
            <l>'Twas you that egged him to it, for you know</l>
            <l>That he is being driven to his death.</l>
            <l>Dectora. That is not true, for he has promised me</l>
            <l>An unimaginable happiness.</l>
            <l>Aibric. And if that happiness be more than dreams,</l>
            <l>More than the froth, the feather, the dust-whirl,</l>
            <l>The crazy nothing that I think it is,</l>
            <l>It shall be in the country of the dead,</l>
            <l>If there be such a country.</l>
            <l>Dectora. No, not there,</l>
            <l>But in some island where the life of the world</l>
            <l>Leaps upward, as if all the streams o' the world</l>
            <l>Had run into one fountain.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Speak to him.</l>
            <l>He knows that he is taking you to death;</l>
            <l>Speak — he will not deny it.</l>
            <l>Dectora. Is that true?</l>
            <l>Forgael. I do not know for certain, but I know.</l>
            <l>That I have the best of pilots.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Shadows, illusions,</l>
            <l>That the Shape-changers, the Ever-laughing Ones,</l>
            <l>The Immortal Mockers have cast into his mind,</l>
            <l>Or called before his eyes.</l>
            <l>Dectora. O carry me</l>
            <l>To some sure country, some familiar place.</l>
            <l>Have we not everything that life can give</l>
            <l>In having one another?</l>
            <l>Forgael. How could I rest</l>
            <l>If I refused the messengers and pilots</l>
            <l>With all those sights and all that crying out?</l>
            <l>Dectora. But I will cover up your eyes and ear?,</l>
            <l>That you may never hear the cry of the birds,</l>
            <l>Or look upon them.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Were they but lowlier</l>
            <l>I'd do your will, but they are too high — too high.</l>
            <l>Dectora. Being too high, their heady prophecies</l>
            <l>But harry us with hopes that come to nothing,</l>
            <l>Because we are not proud, imperishable,</l>
            <l>Alone and winged.</l>
            <l>Forgael. Our love shall be like theirs</l>
            <l>When we have put their changeless image on.</l>
            <l>Dectora. I am a woman, I die at every breath.</l>
            <l>Aibric. Let the birds scatter, for the tree is broken,</l>
            <l>And there's no help in words. [To the Sailors.]</l>
            <l>To the other ship,</l>
            <l>And I will follow you and cut the rope</l>
            <l>When I have said farewell to this man here,</l>
            <l>For neither I nor any living man</l>
            <l>Will look upon his face again.</l>
            <l>[The Sailors go out.]</l>
            <l>Forgael [to Dectora], Go with him,</l>
            <l>For he will shelter you and bring you home.</l>
            <l>Aibric [taking Forgael's hand]. I'll do it for his sake.</l>
            <l>Dectora. No. Take this sword</l>
            <l>And cut the rope, for I go on with Forgael.</l>
            <l>Aibric [half falling into the keen]. The yew-bough has been</l>
            <l>broken into two,</l>
            <l>And all the birds are scattered — O! O! O!</l>
            <l>Farewell! farewell! [He goes out.]</l>
            <l>Dectora. The sword is in the rope — </l>
            <l>The rope's in two — it falls into the sea,</l>
            <l>It whirls into the foam. O ancient worm,</l>
            <l>Dragon that loved the world and held us to it,</l>
            <l>You are broken, you are broken. The world drifts</l>
            <l>away,</l>
            <l>And I am left alone with my beloved,</l>
            <l>Who cannot put me from his sight for ever.</l>
            <l>We are alone for ever, and I laugh,</l>
            <l>Forgael, because you cannot put me from you.</l>
            <l>The mist has covered the heavens, and you and I</l>
            <l>Shall be alone for ever. We two — this crown — </l>
            <l>I half remember. It has been in my dreams.</l>
            <l>Bend lower, O king, that I may crown you with it.</l>
            <l>O flower of the branch, 0 bird among the leaves,</l>
            <l>O silver fish that my two hands have taken</l>
            <l>Out of the running stream, O morning star</l>
            <l>Trembling in the blue heavens like a white fawn</l>
            <l>Upon the misty border of the wood,</l>
            <l>Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair,</l>
            <l>For we will gaze upon this world no longer.</l>
            <l>Forgael [gathering Dectora's hair about him]. Beloved, having dragged the
net about us,</l>
            <l>And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal;</l>
            <l>And that old harp awakens of itself</l>
            <l>To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams,</l>
            <l>That have had dreams for father, live in us.</l>

            <l>THE TWO KINGS</l>
            <l>KING EOCHAID came at sundown to a wood</l>
            <l>Westward of Tara. Hurrying to his queen</l>
            <l>He had outridden his war-wasted men</l>
            <l>That with empounded cattle trod the mire,</l>
            <l>And where beech-trees had mixed a pale green light</l>
            <l>With the ground-ivy's blue, he saw a stag</l>
            <l>Whiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.</l>
            <l>Because it stood upon his path and seemed</l>
            <l>More hands in height than any stag in the world</l>
            <l>He sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth</l>
            <l>Upon his trembling horse, then drove the spur;</l>
            <l>But the stag stooped and ran at him, and passed,</l>
            <l>Rending the horse's flank. King Eochaid reeled,</l>
            <l>Then drew his sword to hold its levelled point</l>
            <l>Against the stag. When horn and steel were met</l>
            <l>The horn resounded as though it had been silver,</l>
            <l>A sweet, miraculous, terrifying sound.</l>
            <l>Horn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there</l>
            <l>As though a stag and unicorn were met</l>
            <l>Among the African Mountains of the Moon,</l>
            <l>Until at last the double horns, drawn backward,</l>
            <l>Butted below the single and so pierced</l>
            <l>The entrails of the horse. Dropping his sword</l>
            <l>King Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands</l>
            <l>And stared into the sea-green eye, and so</l>
            <l>Hither and thither to and fro they trod</l>
            <l>Till all the place was beaten into mire.</l>
            <l>The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met,</l>
            <l>The hands that gathered up the might of the world,</l>
            <l>And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed</l>
            <l>Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air.</l>
            <l>Through bush they plunged and over ivied root,</l>
            <l>And where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves</l>
            <l>A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;</l>
            <l>But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks</l>
            <l>Against a beech-bole, he threw down the beast</l>
            <l>And knelt above it with drawn knife. On the instant</l>
            <l>It vanished like a shadow, and a cry</l>
            <l>So mournful that it seemed the cry of one</l>
            <l>Who had lost some unimaginable treasure</l>
            <l>Wandered between the blue and the green leaf</l>
            <l>And climbed into the air, crumbling away,</l>
            <l>Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision</l>
            <l>But for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,</l>
            <l>The disembowelled horse.</l>
            <l>King Eochaid ran</l>
            <l>Toward peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath</l>
            <l>Until he came before the painted wall,</l>
            <l>The posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,</l>
            <l>Of the great door; but though the hanging lamps</l>
            <l>Showed their faint light through the unshuttered</l>
            <l>windows,</l>
            <l>Nor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,</l>
            <l>Nor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound</l>
            <l>From well-side or from plough-land, was there noise;</l>
            <l>Nor had there been the noise of living thing</l>
            <l>Before him or behind, but that far off</l>
            <l>On the horizon edge bellowed the herds.</l>
            <l>Knowing that silence brings no good to kings,</l>
            <l>And mocks returning victory, he passed</l>
            <l>Between the pillars with a beating heart</l>
            <l>And saw where in the midst of the great hall</l>
            <l>pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain</l>
            <l>Sat upright with a sword before her feet.</l>
            <l>Her hands on either side had gripped the bench.</l>
            <l>Her eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.</l>
            <l>Some passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot</l>
            <l>She started and then knew whose foot it was;</l>
            <l>But when he thought to take her in his arms</l>
            <l>She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:</l>
            <l>`I have sent among the fields or to the woods</l>
            <l>The fighting-men and servants of this house,</l>
            <l>For I would have your judgment upon one</l>
            <l>Who is self-accused. If she be innocent</l>
            <l>She would not look in any known man's face</l>
            <l>Till judgment has been given, and if guilty,</l>
            <l>Would never look again on known man's face.'</l>
            <l>And at these words he paled, as she had paled,</l>
            <l>Knowing that he should find upon her lips</l>
            <l>The meaning of that monstrous day.</l>
            <l>Then she:</l>
            <l>`You brought me where your brother Ardan sat</l>
            <l>Always in his one seat, and bid me care him</l>
            <l>Through that strange illness that had fixed him there.</l>
            <l>And should he die to heap his burial-mound</l>
            <l>And carve his name in Ogham.' Eochaid said,</l>
            <l>`He lives?' `He lives and is a healthy man.'</l>
            <l>`While I have him and you it matters little</l>
            <l>What man you have lost, what evil you have found.'</l>
            <l>`I bid them make his bed under this roof</l>
            <l>And carried him his food with my own hands,</l>
            <l>And so the weeks passed by. But when I said,</l>
            <l>"What is this trouble?" he would answer nothing,</l>
            <l>Though always at my words his trouble grew;</l>
            <l>And I but asked the more, till he cried out,</l>
            <l>Weary of many questions: "There are things</l>
            <l>That make the heart akin to the dumb stone."</l>
            <l>Then I replied, "Although you hide a secret,</l>
            <l>Hopeless and dear, or terrible to think on,</l>
            <l>Speak it, that I may send through the wide world</l>
            <l>Day after day you question me, and I,</l>
            <l>Because there is such a storm amid my thoughts</l>
            <l>I shall be carried in the gust, command,</l>
            <l>Forbid, beseech and waste my breath." Then I:</l>
            <l>Although the thing that you have hid were evil,</l>
            <l>The speaking of it could be no great wrong,</l>
            <l>And evil must it be, if done 'twere worse</l>
            <l>Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in,</l>
            <l>And loosen on us dreams that waste our life,</l>
            <l>Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain."</l>
            <l>but finding him still silent I stooped down</l>
            <l>And whispering that none but he should hear,</l>
            <l>Said, "If a woman has put this on you,</l>
            <l>My men, whether it please her or displease,</l>
            <l>And though they have to cross the Loughlan waters</l>
            <l>And take her in the middle of armed men,</l>
            <l>Shall make her look upon her handiwork,</l>
            <l>That she may quench the rick she has fired; and</l>
            <l>though</l>
            <l>She may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,</l>
            <l>She'll not be proud, knowing within her heart</l>
            <l>That our sufficient portion of the world</l>
            <l>Is that we give, although it be brief giving,</l>
            <l>Happiness to children and to men."</l>
            <l>Then he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,</l>
            <l>And speaking what he would not though he would,</l>
            <l>Sighed, "You, even you yourself, could work the</l>
            <l>cure!"</l>
            <l>And at those words I rose and I went out</l>
            <l>And for nine days he had food from other hands,</l>
            <l>And for nine days my mind went whirling round</l>
            <l>The one disastrous zodiac, muttering</l>
            <l>That the immedicable mound's beyond</l>
            <l>Our questioning, beyond our pity even.</l>
            <l>But when nine days had gone I stood again</l>
            <l>Before his chair and bending down my head</l>
            <l>I bade him go when all his household slept</l>
            <l>To an old empty woodman's house that's hidden</l>
            <l>Westward of Tara, among the hazel-trees — </l>
            <l>For hope would give his limbs the power — and</l>
            <l>await</l>
            <l>A friend that could, he had told her, work his cure</l>
            <l>And would be no harsh friend.</l>
            <l>When night had deepened,</l>
            <l>I groped my way from beech to hazel wood,</l>
            <l>Found that old house, a sputtering torch within,</l>
            <l>And stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins</l>
            <l>Ardan, and though I called to him and tried</l>
            <l>To Shake him out of sleep, I could not rouse him.</l>
            <l>I waited till the night was on the turn,</l>
            <l>Then fearing that some labourer, on his way</l>
            <l>To plough or pasture-land, might see me there,</l>
            <l>Went out.</l>
            <l>Among the ivy-covered rocks,</l>
            <l>As on the blue light of a sword, a man</l>
            <l>Who had unnatural majesty, and eyes</l>
            <l>Like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,</l>
            <l>Stood on my path. Trembling from head to foot</l>
            <l>I gazed at him like grouse upon a kite;</l>
            <l>But with a voice that had unnatural music,</l>
            <l>"A weary wooing and a long," he said,</l>
            <l>"Speaking of love through other lips and looking</l>
            <l>Under the eyelids of another, for it was my craft</l>
            <l>That put a passion in the sleeper there,</l>
            <l>And when I had got my will and drawn you here,</l>
            <l>Where I may speak to you alone, my craft</l>
            <l>Sucked up the passion out of him again</l>
            <l>And left mere sleep. He'll wake when the sun</l>
            <l>wakes,</l>
            <l>push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes,</l>
            <l>And wonder what has ailed him these twelve</l>
            <l>months."</l>
            <l>I cowered back upon the wall in terror,</l>
            <l>But that sweet-sounding voice ran on: "Woman,</l>
            <l>I was your husband when you rode the air,</l>
            <l>Danced in the whirling foam and in the dust,</l>
            <l>In days you have not kept in memory,</l>
            <l>Being betrayed into a cradle, and I come</l>
            <l>That I may claim you as my wife again."</l>
            <l>I was no longer terrified — his voice</l>
            <l>Had half awakened some old memory — </l>
            <l>Yet answered him, "I am King Eochaid's wife</l>
            <l>And with him have found every happiness</l>
            <l>Women can find." With a most masterful voice,</l>
            <l>That made the body seem as it were a string</l>
            <l>Under a bow, he cried, "What happiness</l>
            <l>Can lovers have that know their happiness</l>
            <l>Must end at the dumb stone? But where we build</l>
            <l>Our sudden palaces in the still air</l>
            <l>pleasure itself can bring no weariness.</l>
            <l>Nor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot</l>
            <l>That has grown weary of the wandering dance,</l>
            <l>Nor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,</l>
            <l>Among those mouths that sing their sweethearts' praise,</l>
            <l>Your empty bed." "How should I love," I answered,</l>
            <l>"Were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed</l>
            <l>And shown my husband sleeping there, I have sighed,</l>
            <l>`Your strength and nobleness will pass away'?</l>
            <l>Or how should love be worth its pains were it not</l>
            <l>That when he has fallen asleep within my arms,</l>
            <l>Being wearied out, I love in man the child?</l>
            <l>What can they know of love that do not know</l>
            <l>She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge</l>
            <l>Above a windy precipice?" Then he:</l>
            <l>"Seeing that when you come to the deathbed</l>
            <l>You must return, whether you would or no,</l>
            <l>This human life blotted from memory,</l>
            <l>Why must I live some thirty, forty years,</l>
            <l>Alone with all this useless happiness?"</l>
            <l>Thereon he seized me in his arms, but I</l>
            <l>Thrust him away with both my hands and cried,</l>
            <l>"Never will I believe there is any change</l>
            <l>Can blot out of my memory this life</l>
            <l>Sweetened by death, but if I could believe,</l>
            <l>That were a double hunger in my lips</l>
            <l>For what is doubly brief."</l>
            <l>And now the shape</l>
            <l>My hands were pressed to vanished suddenly.</l>
            <l>I staggered, but a beech-tree stayed my fall,</l>
            <l>And clinging to it I could hear the cocks</l>
            <l>Crow upon Tara.'</l>
            <l>King Eochaid bowed his head</l>
            <l>And thanked her for her kindness to his brother,</l>
            <l>For that she promised, and for that refused.</l>
            <l>Thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds</l>
            <l>Rose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed</l>
            <l>door</l>
            <l>Jostled and shouted those war-wasted men,</l>
            <l>And in the midst King Eochaid's brother stood,</l>
            <l>And bade all welcome, being ignorant.</l>

            <l>THE GIFT OF HARUN AL-RASHID</l>
            <l>KUSTA BEN LUKA is my name, I write</l>
            <l>To Abd Al-Rabban; fellow-roysterer once,</l>
            <l>Now the good Caliph's learned Treasurer,</l>
            <l>And for no ear but his.</l>
            <l>Carry this letter</l>
            <l>Through the great gallery of the Treasure House</l>
            <l>Where banners of the Caliphs hang, night-coloured</l>
            <l>But brilliant as the night's embroidery,</l>
            <l>And wait war's music; pass the little gallery;</l>
            <l>Pass books of learning from Byzantium</l>
            <l>Written in gold upon a purple stain,</l>
            <l>And pause at last, I was about to say,</l>
            <l>At the great book of Sappho's song; but no,</l>
            <l>For should you leave my letter there, a boy's</l>
            <l>Love-lorn, indifferent hands might come upon it</l>
            <l>And let it fall unnoticed to the floor.</l>
            <l>pause at the Treatise of Parmenides</l>
            <l>And hide it there, for Caliphs to world's end</l>
            <l>Must keep that perfect, as they keep her song,</l>
            <l>So great its fame.</l>
            <l>When fitting time has passed</l>
            <l>The parchment will disclose to some learned man</l>
            <l>A mystery that else had found no chronicler</l>
            <l>But the wild Bedouin. Though I approve</l>
            <l>Those wanderers that welcomed in their tents</l>
            <l>What great Harun Al-Rashid, occupied</l>
            <l>With Persian embassy or Grecian war,</l>
            <l>Must needs neglect, I cannot hide the truth</l>
            <l>That wandering in a desert, featureless</l>
            <l>As air under a wing, can give birds' wit.</l>
            <l>In after time they will speak much of me</l>
            <l>And speak but fantasy. Recall the year</l>
            <l>When our beloved Caliph put to death</l>
            <l>His Vizir Jaffer for an unknown reason:</l>
            <l>`If but the shirt upon my body knew it</l>
            <l>I'd tear it off and throw it in the fire.'</l>
            <l>That speech was all that the town knew, but he</l>
            <l>Seemed for a while to have grown young again;</l>
            <l>Seemed so on purpose, muttered Jaffer's friends,</l>
            <l>That none might know that he was conscience-struck — </l>
            <l>But that s a traitor's thought. Enough for me</l>
            <l>That in the early summer of the year</l>
            <l>The mightiest of the princes of the world</l>
            <l>Came to the least considered of his courtiers;</l>
            <l>Sat down upon the fountain's marble edge,</l>
            <l>One hand amid the goldfish in the pool;</l>
            <l>And thereupon a colloquy took place</l>
            <l>That I commend to all the chroniclers</l>
            <l>To show how violent great hearts can lose</l>
            <l>Their bitterness and find the honeycomb.</l>
            <l>`I have brought a slender bride into the house;</l>
            <l>You know the saying, "Change the bride with spring."</l>
            <l>And she and I, being sunk in happiness,</l>
            <l>Cannot endure to think you tread these paths,</l>
            <l>When evening stirs the jasmine bough, and yet</l>
            <l>Are brideless.'</l>
            <l>`I am falling into years.'</l>
            <l>`But such as you and I do not seem old</l>
            <l>Like men who live by habit. Every day</l>
            <l>I ride with falcon to the river's edge</l>
            <l>Or carry the ringed mail upon my back,</l>
            <l>Or court a woman; neither enemy,</l>
            <l>Game-bird, nor woman does the same thing twice;</l>
            <l>And so a hunter carries in the eye</l>
            <l>A mimic of youth. Can poet's thought</l>
            <l>That springs from body and in body falls</l>
            <l>Like this pure jet, now lost amid blue sky,</l>
            <l>Now bathing lily leaf and fish's scale,</l>
            <l>Be mimicry?'</l>
            <l>`What matter if our souls</l>
            <l>Are nearer to the surface of the body</l>
            <l>Than souls that start no game and turn no rhyme!</l>
            <l>The soul's own youth and not the body's youth</l>
            <l>Shows through our lineaments. My candle's bright,</l>
            <l>My lantern is too loyal not to show</l>
            <l>That it was made in your great father's reign,</l>
            <l>And yet the jasmine season warms our blood.'</l>
            <l>`Great prince, forgive the freedom of my speech:</l>
            <l>You think that love has seasons, and you think</l>
            <l>That if the spring bear off what the spring gave</l>
            <l>The heart need suffer no defeat; but I</l>
            <l>Who have accepted the Byzantine faith,</l>
            <l>That seems unnatural to Arabian minds,</l>
            <l>Think when I choose a bride I choose for ever;</l>
            <l>And if her eye should not grow bright for mine</l>
            <l>Or brighten only for some younger eye,</l>
            <l>My heart could never turn from daily ruin,</l>
            <l>Nor find a remedy.'</l>
            <l>`But what if I</l>
            <l>Have lit upon a woman who so shares</l>
            <l>Your thirst for those old crabbed mysteries,</l>
            <l>So strains to look beyond Our life, an eye</l>
            <l>That never knew that strain would scarce seem bright,</l>
            <l>And yet herself can seem youth's very fountain,</l>
            <l>Being all brimmed with life?'</l>
            <l>`Were it but true</l>
            <l>I would have found the best that life can give,</l>
            <l>Companionship in those mysterious things</l>
            <l>That make a man's soul or a woman's soul</l>
            <l>Itself and not some other soul.'</l>
            <l>`That love</l>
            <l>Must needs be in this life and in what follows</l>
            <l>Unchanging and at peace, and it is right</l>
            <l>Every philosopher should praise that love.</l>
            <l>But I being none can praise its opposite.</l>
            <l>It makes my passion stronger but to think</l>
            <l>Like passion stirs the peacock and his mate,</l>
            <l>The wild stag and the doe; that mouth to mouth</l>
            <l>Is a man's mockery of the changeless soul.'</l>
            <l>And thereupon his bounty gave what now</l>
            <l>Can shake more blossom from autumnal chill</l>
            <l>Than all my bursting springtime knew. A girl</l>
            <l>Perched in some window of her mother's house</l>
            <l>Had watched my daily passage to and fro;</l>
            <l>Had heard impossible history of my past;</l>
            <l>Imagined some impossible history</l>
            <l>Lived at my side; thought time's disfiguring touch</l>
            <l>Gave but more reason for a woman's care.</l>
            <l>Yet was it love of me, or was it love</l>
            <l>Of the stark mystery that has dazed my sight,</l>
            <l>perplexed her fantasy and planned her care?</l>
            <l>Or did the torchlight of that mystery</l>
            <l>Pick out my features in such light and shade</l>
            <l>Two contemplating passions chose one theme</l>
            <l>Through sheer bewilderment? She had not paced</l>
            <l>The garden paths, nor counted up the rooms,</l>
            <l>Before she had spread a book upon her knees</l>
            <l>And asked about the pictures or the text;</l>
            <l>And often those first days I saw her stare</l>
            <l>On old dry writing in a learned tongue,</l>
            <l>On old dry faggots that could never please</l>
            <l>The extravagance of spring; or move a hand</l>
            <l>As if that writing or the figured page</l>
            <l>Were some dear cheek.</l>
            <l>Upon a moonless night</l>
            <l>I sat where I could watch her sleeping form,</l>
            <l>And wrote by candle-light; but her form moved.</l>
            <l>And fearing that my light disturbed her sleep</l>
            <l>I rose that I might screen it with a cloth.</l>
            <l>I heard her voice, `Turn that I may expound</l>
            <l>What's bowed your shoulder and made pale your cheek</l>
            <l>And saw her sitting upright on the bed;</l>
            <l>Or was it she that spoke or some great Djinn?</l>
            <l>I say that a Djinn spoke. A livelong hour</l>
            <l>She seemed the learned man and I the child;</l>
            <l>Truths without father came, truths that no book</l>
            <l>Of all the uncounted books that I have read,</l>
            <l>Nor thought out of her mind or mine begot,</l>
            <l>Self-born, high-born, and solitary truths,</l>
            <l>Those terrible implacable straight lines</l>
            <l>Drawn through the wandering vegetative dream,</l>
            <l>Even those truths that when my bones are dust</l>
            <l>Must drive the Arabian host.</l>
            <l>The voice grew still,</l>
            <l>And she lay down upon her bed and slept,</l>
            <l>But woke at the first gleam of day, rose up</l>
            <l>And swept the house and sang about her work</l>
            <l>In childish ignorance of all that passed.</l>
            <l>A dozen nights of natural sleep, and then</l>
            <l>When the full moon swam to its greatest height</l>
            <l>She rose, and with her eyes shut fast in sleep</l>
            <l>Walked through the house. Unnoticed and unfelt</l>
            <l>I wrapped her in a hooded cloak, and she,</l>
            <l>Half running, dropped at the first ridge of the desert</l>
            <l>And there marked out those emblems on the sand</l>
            <l>That day by day I study and marvel at,</l>
            <l>With her white finger. I led her home asleep</l>
            <l>And once again she rose and swept the house</l>
            <l>In childish ignorance of all that passed.</l>
            <l>Even to-day, after some seven years</l>
            <l>When maybe thrice in every moon her mouth</l>
            <l>Murmured the wisdom of the desert Djinns,</l>
            <l>She keeps that ignorance, nor has she now</l>
            <l>That first unnatural interest in my books.</l>
            <l>It seems enough that I am there; and yet,</l>
            <l>Old fellow-student, whose most patient ear</l>
            <l>Heard all the anxiety of my passionate youth,</l>
            <l>It seems I must buy knowledge with my peace.</l>
            <l>What if she lose her ignorance and so</l>
            <l>Dream that I love her only for the voice,</l>
            <l>That every gift and every word of praise</l>
            <l>Is but a payment for that midnight voice</l>
            <l>That is to age what milk is to a child?</l>
            <l>Were she to lose her love, because she had lost</l>
            <l>Her confidence in mine, or even lose</l>
            <l>Its first simplicity, love, voice and all,</l>
            <l>All my fine feathers would be plucked away</l>
            <l>And I left shivering. The voice has drawn</l>
            <l>A quality of wisdom from her love's</l>
            <l>Particular quality. The signs and shapes;</l>
            <l>All those abstractions that you fancied were</l>
            <l>From the great Treatise of parmenides;</l>
            <l>All, all those gyres and cubes and midnight things</l>
            <l>Are but a new expression of her body</l>
            <l>Drunk with the bitter sweetness of her youth.</l>
            <l>And now my utmost mystery is out.</l>
            <l>A woman's beauty is a storm-tossed banner;</l>
            <l>Under it wisdom stands, and I alone — </l>
            <l>Of all Arabia's lovers I alone — </l>
            <l>Nor dazzled by the embroidery, nor lost</l>
            <l>In the confusion of its night-dark folds,</l>
            <l>Can hear the armed man speak.</l>
