            <head>THE FIRST BOOKE, Of Poets and Poesie.</head>
            <div xml:id="c1.1" type="chapter">
               <head>What poet and Poesie is, and who may be worthily sayd the most excellent Poet of our time. </head>
               <pb n="1"/>
               <p>A Poet is as much to say as a maker. And our English name well conformes 
with the Greek word: for of <foreign xml:lang="el">poiyin</foreign> to make, 
they call a maker <hi>Poeta</hi>. Such as (by way of resemblance and 
reuerently) we may say of God: who without any trauell to his diuine 
imagination, made all the world of nought, nor also by any paterne or mould 
as the Platonicks with their Ideas do phantastically suppose. Euen so the 
very Poet makes and contriues out of his owne braine both the verse and 
matter of his poeme, and not by any foreine copie or example, as doth the 
translator, who therefore may well be sayd a versifier, but not a Poet. The 
premises considered, it giueth to the name and profession no smal dignitie 
and preheminence, aboue all other artificers, Scientificke or Mechanicall. 
And neuerthelesse without any repugnancie at all, a Poet may in some sort 
be said a follower or imitator, because he can expresse the true and liuely 
of euery thing is set before him, and which he taketh in hand to describe: 
and so in that respect is both a maker and a counterfaitor: and Poesie an art 
not only of making, but also of imitation. And this science in his perfection, 
can not grow, but by some diuine instinct, the Platonicks call it <hi>furor</hi>: 
or by excellencie of nature and complexion: or by great subtiltie of the 
spirits &amp; wit or by much experience and obseruation of the world, and 
course of kinde, or <pb n="2"/>
peraduenture by all or most part of them. Otherwise how was it possible 
that <hi>Homer</hi> being but a poore priuate man, and as some say, in his 
later age blind, should so exactly set foorth and describe, as if he had bene a 
most excellent Captaine or Generall, the order and array of battels, the 
conduct of whole armies, the sieges and assaults of cities and townes? or 
as some great Princes maiordome and perfect Surueyour in Court, the order, 
sumptuousnesse and magnificence of royal bankers, feasts, weddings, and 
enteruewes? or as a Polititian very prudent, and much inured with the 
priuat and publique affaires, so grauely examine the lawes and ordinances 
Ciuill, or so profoundly discourse in matters of estate, and formes of all 
politique regiment? Finally how could he so naturally paint out the 
speeches, countenance and maners of Princely persons and priuate, to wit, 
the wrath of <hi>Achilles,</hi>&gt;, the magnanimitie of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>, the 
prudence of <hi>Menelaus</hi>, the prowesse of <hi>Hector</hi>, the maiestie of 
king <hi>Priamus</hi>, the grauitie of <hi>Nestor</hi>, the pollicies and 
eloquence of <hi>Vlysses</hi>, the calamities of the distressed 
<hi>Queenes</hi>, and valiance of all the Captaines and aduenturous knights in 
those lamentable warres of Troy? It is therefore of Poets thus to be 
conceiued, that if they be able to deuise and make all these things of them 
selues, without any subiect of veritie, that they be (by maner of speech) as 
creating gods. If they do it by instinct diuine or naturall, then surely much 
fauoured from aboue. If by their experience, then no doubt very wise men. If 
by any president or paterne layd before them, then truly the most excellent 
imitators &amp; counterfaitors of all others. But you (Madame) my most 
Honored and Gracious: if I should seeme to offer you this my deuise for a 
discipline and not a delight, I might well be reputed, of all others the most 
arrogant and iniurious: your selfe being alreadie, of any that I know in our 
time, the most excellent Poet. Forsooth by your Princely purse fauours and 
countenance, making in maner what ye list, the poore man rich, the lewd 
well learned, the coward couragious, and vile both noble and valiant. Then 
for imitation no lesse, your person as a most cunning counterfaitor liuely 
representing <hi>Venus</hi> in countenance, in life <hi>Diana</hi>, <hi>Pallas</hi>
for gouernement, and <hi>Iuno</hi> in all honour and regall magnificence.

               <head>That there may be an Art of our English Poesie, as well as there is of the Latine and Greeke.</head>
               <p>Then as there was no art in the world till by experience found out: so if 
Poesie be now an Art, &amp; of al antiquitie hath bene among the Greeks and 
Latines, &amp; yet were none, vntill by studious persons fashioned and 
reduced into a method of rules &amp; precepts, then no doubt may there be 
the like with vs. And if th'art of Poesie be but a skill appertaining to 
vtterance, why may not the same be with vs aswel as with them, our 
language being no less copious pithie and significatiue then theirs, our 
concepts the same, and our wits no less apt to deuise and imitate then theirs 
were? If againe Art be but a certaine order of rules prescribed by reason, 
and gathered by experience, why should not Poesie be a vulgar Art with vs 
aswell as with the Greeks and Latines, our language admitting no fewer 
rules and nice diuersities then theirs? but peraduenture moe by a peculiar, 
which our speech hath in many things differing from theirs: and yet in the 
generall points of that Art, allowed to go in common with them: so as if one 
point perchance which is their feete whereupon their measures stand, and in 
deede is all the beautie of their Poesie, and which feete we haue not, nor as 
yet neuer went about to frame (the nature of our language and wordes not 
permitting it) we haue in stead thereof twentie other curious points in that 
skill more then they euer had, by reason of our rime and tunable concords or 
simphonie, which they neuer obserued. Poesie therefore may be an Art in 
our vulgar, and that verie methodicall and commendable.

            <div xml:id="c1.3" type="chapter">
               <head>How Poets were the first priests, the first prophets, the first Legislators and politicians in the world.</head>
               <p>The profession and vse of Poesie is most ancient from the beginning, and not 
as manie erroniously suppose, after, but before any ciuil society was among 
men. For it is written, that Poesie was th'originall cause and occasion of 
their first assemblies, when before the people remained in the woods and 
mountains, vagarant and dispersed like the wild beasts, lawlesse and 
naked, or verie ill <pb n="4"/>
clad, and of all good and necessarie prouision for harbour or sustenance 
vtterly vnfurnished: so as they litle diffred for their maner of life, from 
the very brute beasts of the field. Whereupon it is fayned that 
<hi>Amphion</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi>, two Poets of the first ages, one of them, 
to wit <hi>Amphion</hi>, builded vp cities, and reared walles with the stones 
that came in heapes to the sound of his harpe, figuring thereby the 
mollifying of hard and stonie hearts by his sweete and eloquent perswasion. 
And <hi>Orpheus</hi> assembled the wilde beasts to come in heards to harken 
to his musicke, and by that meanes made them tame, implying thereby, how 
by his discreete and wholsome lessons vttered in harmonie and with 
melodious instruments, he brought the rude and sauage people to a more 
ciuill and orderly life, nothing, as it seemeth, more preuailing or fit to 
redresse and edifie the cruell and sturdie courage of man then it. And as 
these two Poets and <hi>Linus</hi> before them, and <hi>Museus</hi> also and 
<hi>Hesiodus</hi> in Greece and Archadia: so by all likelihood had mo Poets 
done in other places, and in other ages before them, though there be no 
remembrance left of them, by reason of the Recordes by some accident of 
time perished and failing. Poets therfore are of great antiquitie. Then 
forasmuch as they were the first that entended to the obseruation of nature 
and her works, and specially of the Celestiall course, by reason of the 
continuall motion of the heauens, searching after the first mouer, and from 
thence by degrees comming to know and consider of the substances separate 
&amp; abstract, which we call the diuine intelligences or good Angels 
(<hi>Demones</hi>) they were the first that instituted sacrifices of placation, 
with inuocations and worship to them, as to Gods: and inuented and 
stablished all the rest of the obseruances and ceremonies of religion, and so 
were the first Priests and ministers of the holy misteries. And because for 
the better execution of that high charge and function, it behoued them to 
liue chast, and in all holines of life, and in continuall studie and 
contemplation: they came by instinct diuine, and by deepe meditation, and 
much abstinence (the same assubtiling and refining their spirits) to be made 
apt to receaue visions, both waking and sleeping, which made them vtter 
prophesies, and foretell things to come. So also were they the first 
Prophetes or seears, <hi>Videntes</hi> for so the Scripture tearmeth them in 
Latine after <pb n="5"/>
the Hebrue word, and all the oracles and answers of the gods were giuen in 
meeter or verse, and published to the people by their direction. And for that 
they were aged and graue men, and of much wisedome and experience in 
th'affaires of the world, they were the first lawmakers to the people, and 
the first polititiens, deuising all expedient meanes for th'establishment of 
Common wealth, to hold and containe the people in order and duety by force 
and vertue of good and wholesome lawes, made for the preseruation of the 
publique peace and tranquilitie. The same peraduenture not purposely 
intended, but greatly furthered by the aw of their gods, and such scruple of 
conscience, as the terrors of their late inuented religion had led them into.

               <head>How the Poets were the first Philosophers, the first Astronomers and Historiographers and Oratours and Musitiens of the world.</head>
               <p>Vtterance also and language is giuen by nature to man for perswasion of 
others, and aide of them selues, I meane the first abilitie to speake. For 
speech it selfe is artificiall and made by man, and the more pleasing it is, 
the more it preuaileth to such purpose as it is intended for: but speech by 
meeter is a kind of vtterance, more cleanly couched and more delicate to the 
eare then prose is, because it is more currant and slipper vpon the tongue, 
and withal tunable and melodious, as a kind of Musicke, and therfore may be 
tearmed a musicall speech or vtterance, which cannot but please the hearer 
very well. Another cause is, for that it is briefer &amp; more compendious, 
and easier to beare away and be retained in memorie, then that which is 
contained in multitude of words and full of tedious ambage and long periods. 
It is beside a maner of vtterance more eloquent and rethoricall then the 
ordinarie profe, which we vse in our daily talke: because it is decked and 
set out with all maner of fresh colours and figures, which maketh that it 
sooner inuegleth the iudgement of man, and carieth his opinion this way and 
that whither soeuer the heart by impression of the eare shalbe most 
affectionatly bent and directed. The vtterance in prose is not of so great 
efficacie, because not only it is dayly vsed, and by that occasion the eare is 
ouerglutted with it, but is also not so voluble <pb n="6"/>
and slipper vpon the tong, being wide and lose, and nothing numerous, nor 
contriued into measures, and sounded with so gallant and harmonical 
accents, nor in fine alowed that figuratiue conueyance, nor so great license 
in choise of words and phrases as meeter is. So as the Poets were also from 
the beginning the best perswaders and their eloquence the first Rethoricke 
of the world. Euen so it became that the high mysteries of the gods should 
be reuealed &amp; taught, by a maner of vtterance and language of 
extraordinarie phrase, and briefe and compendious, and aboue al others 
sweet and ciuill and the Metricall is. The same also was meetest to 
register the liues and noble gests of Princes, and of the great Monarkes of 
the world, and all other the memorable accidents of time: so as the Poet 
was also the first historiographer. Then forasmuch as they were the first 
obseruers of all naturall causes &amp; effects in the things generable and 
corruptible, and from thence mounted vp to search after the celestiall 
courses and influences, &amp; yet penetrated further to know the diuine 
essences and substances separate, as is sayd before, they were the first 
Astronomers and Philosophists and Metaphisicks. Finally, because they did 
altogether endeuour them selues to reduce the life of man to a certaine 
method of good maners, and made the first differences between vertue and 
vice, and then tempered all these knowledges and skilles with the exercise 
of a delectable Musicke by melodious instruments, which withall serued 
them to delight their hearers, &amp; to call the people together by 
admiration, to a plausible and vertuous conuersation, therefore were they 
the first Philosophers Ethick, &amp; the first artificial Musiciens of the 
world. Such was <hi>Linus, Orpheus, Amphion &amp; Museus</hi> the most 
ancient Poets and Philosophers, of whom there is left any memorie by the 
prophane writers. King <hi>David</hi> also &amp; <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne and 
many other of the holy Prophets wrate in meeters, and vsed to sing them to 
the harpe, although to many of vs ignorant of the Hebrue language and 
phrase, and not obseruing it, the same seeme but a profe. It can not bee 
therefore that anie scorne or indignitie should iustly be offred to so noble, 
profitable, ancient and diuine a science as Poesie is.

            </div>
            <div xml:id="c1.5" type="chapter">
               <head>How the wilde and sauage people used a naturall Poesie in versicle and rime as our vulgar is.</head>
               <pb n="7"/>
               <p>And the Greeke and Latine Poesie was by verse numerous and metricall, 
running vpon pleasant feete, sometimes swift, sometime slow (their words 
very aptly seruing that purpose) but without any rime or tunable concord in 
th'end of their verses, as we and all other nations now vse. But the Hebrues 
&amp; Chaldees who were more ancient then the Greekes, did not only vse a 
metricall Poesie, but also with the same a maner of rime, as hath bene of 
late obserued by learned men. Wherby it appeareth, that our vulgar running 
Poesie was common to all the nations of the world besides, whom the 
Latines and Greekes in speciall called barbarous. So as it was 
notwithstanding the first and most ancient Poesie, and the most vniuersall, 
which two points do otherwise giue to all humane inuentions and affaires no 
small credit. This is proued by certificate of marchants &amp; trauellers, 
who by late nauigations haue surueyed the whole world, and discouered large 
countries and strange peoples wild and sauage, affirming that the American, 
the Perusine &amp; the very Canniball, do sing and also say, their highest 
and holiest matters in certaine riming versicles and not in prose, which 
proues also that our maner of vulgar Poesie is more ancient then the 
artificiall of the Greeks and Latines, ours comming by instinct of nature, 
which was before Art or obseruation, and vsed with the sauage and vnciuill, 
who were before all science or ciuilitie, euen as the naked by prioritie of 
time is before the clothed, and the ignorant before the learned. The naturall 
Poesie therefore being aided and amended by Art, and not vtterly altered or 
obscured, but some signe left of it, (as the Greekes and Latines haue left 
none) is no lesse to be allowed and commended then theirs. 

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="c1.6" type="chapter">
               <head>How the riming Poesie came first to the Grecians and Latines, and had altered and almost spilt their maner of Poesie.</head>
               <p>Bvt it came to passe, when fortune fled farre from the Greekes and Latines, 
&amp; that their townes florished no more in traficke, nor their 
Vniversities in learning as they had done continuing those Monarchies: the 
barbarous conquerers inuading them with innumerable swarmes of strange 
nations, the Poesie metricall of the Grecians and Latines came to be much 
corrupted and altered, <pb n="8"/>
in so much as there were times that the very Greekes and Latines 
themselues tooke pleasure in Riming verses, and vsed it as a rare and 
gallant thing: Yea their Oratours proses nor the Doctors Sermons were 
acceptable to Princes nor yet to the common people vnlesse it went in 
manner of tunable rime or metricall sentences, as appeares by many of the 
auncient writers, about that time and since. And the great Princes, and 
Popes, and Sultans would one salute and greet an other sometime in 
friendship and sport, sometime in earnest and enmitie by ryming verses, 
&amp; nothing seemed clerkly done, but must be done in ryme: Whereof we 
finde diuers examples from the time of th'Emperours Gracian &amp; 
Valentinian downwardes: For then aboutes began the declination of the 
Romain Empire, by the notable inundations of the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and 
<hi>Vandalles</hi> in Europe, vnder the conduict of <hi>Totila</hi> &amp; 
<hi>Atila</hi> and other their generalles. This brought the ryming Poesie in 
grace, and made it preuaile in Italie and Greece (their owne long time cast 
aside, and almost neglected) till after many yeares that the peace of Italie 
and of th'Empire Occidentall reuiued new clerkes, who recouering and 
perusing the bookes and studies of the ciuiler ages, restored all maner of 
arts, and that of the Greeke and Latine Poesie withall into their former 
puritie and netnes. Which neuerthelesse did not so preuaile, but that the 
ryming Poesie of the Barbarians remained still in his reputation, that one in 
the schole, this other in Courts of Princes more ordinary and allowable.

            <div xml:id="c1.7" type="chapter">
               <head>How in the time of Charlemaine and many yeares after him the Latine Poetes wrote in ryme.</head>
               <p>And this appeareth euidently by the workes of many learned men, who wrote 
about the time of <hi>Charlemaines</hi> raigne in the Empire 
<hi>Occidentall</hi>, where the Christian Religion, became through the 
excessiue authoritie of Popes, and deepe deuotion of Princes strongly 
fortified and established by erection of orders <hi>Monastical</hi>, in which 
many simple clerks for deuotion sake &amp; sanctitie were receiued more 
then for any learning, by which occasion &amp; the solitarinesse of their 
life, waxing studious without discipline or instruction by any good methode, 
some of them grew to be historiographers, <pb n="9"/>
some Poets, and following either the barbarous rudenes of the 
time, or els their own idle inuentions, all that they wrote to the fauor or 
prayse of Princes, they did it in such maner of minstrelsie, and thought 
themselues no small fooles, when they could make their verses goe all in 
ryme as did the schoole of <hi>Salerne</hi>, dedicating their booke of 
medicinall rules vnto our king of England, with this beginning. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Anglorum Rege scripsit tota schola Salerni</hi>
               </l>

                  <hi>Sivis incolumem, sivis, te reddere sanum</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Nec retine ventrem nec stringas fortiter annum</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And all the rest that follow throughout the whole booke more curiously then 
cleanely, neuerthelesse very well to the purpose of their arte. In the same 
time king <hi>Edward</hi> the iii. him selfe quartering the Armes of England 
and France, did discouer his pretence and clayme to the Crowne of Fraunce, 
in these ryming verses.

al in their superlatiue. So did euery scholer &amp; secular clerke or 
versifier, when he wrote any short poeme or matter of good lesson put in in 
ryme, whereby it came to passe that all your old Prouerbes and common 
sayinges, which they would haue plausible to the reader and easie to

               <p>If I might haue bene his Iudge, I would haue had him for his labour, serued as 
<hi>Orpheus</hi> was by the women of Thrace. His eyes to be picket out with 
pinnes, for his so deadly belying of them, or worse handled if worse could be 
deuised. But will ye see how God raised a reuenger for the silly innocent 
women, for about the same tyming age came an honest ciuill Courtier 
somewhat bookish, and wrate these verses against the whole rable of 
Monkes. 

</p>
               <l>

them from their wiues, &amp; railed as fast against him.

</l>
               <p>Thus what in writing of rymes and registring of lyes was the Clergy of that 
fabulous age wholly occupied. 


</p>
               <p>We finde some but very few of these ryming verses among the <pb n="11"/>
Latines of the ciuiller ages, and those rather hapning by chaunce then of any 
purpose in the writer, as this <hi>Distick</hi> among the disportes of 
<hi>Ouid</hi>. 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Quot caelum stellas tot habet tua Roman puellas</hi>

                        <hi>Pascua quotq haedos tot habet tua Roma Cynaedos</hi>. </l>
                  </q>

The posteritie taking pleasure in this manner of <hi>Simphonie</hi> had 
leasure as it seems to deuise many other knackes in their versifying that 
the auncient and ciuill Poets had not vsed before, whereof one was to make 
euery word of a verse to begin with the same letter, as did <hi>Hugobald</hi>
the Monke who made a large poeme to the honour of <hi>Carolus Caluus</hi>, 
euery word beginning with <hi>C</hi>. which was the first letter of the kings 
name thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Carmina clarisonae Caluis cantate camenae</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And this was thought no small peece of cunning, being in deed a matter of 
some difficultie to finde out so many wordes beginning with one letter as 
might make a iust volume, thought in truth it were but a phantasticall 
deuise and to no purpose at all more then to make them harmonicall to the 
rude eares of those barbarous ages. 


</p>
               <p>Another of their pretie inuentions was to make a verse of such wordes as by 
their nature and manner of construction and situation might be turned 
backward word by word, and make another perfit verse, but of quite contrary 
sence as the gibing Monke that wrote of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> these two 
verses. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Laus tua non tua fraus, virtus non copia rerum,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Scandere te faciunt hoc decus eximium</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Which if ye will turne backward they make two other good verses, but of a contrary sence, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eximium decus hoc faciunt te scandere rerum</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Copia, non virtus, frans tua non tua laus</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And they called it <hi>Verso Lyon</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Thus you may see the humors and appetites of men how diuers and 
chaungeable they be in liking new fashions, though many tymes worse then 
the old, and not onely in the manner of their life and vse of their garments, 
but also in their learninges and arts and specially of their languages.

               <head>In what reputation Poesie and Poets were in old time with Princes and otherwise generally, and how they be now become contemptible and for what causes.</head>
               <p>For the respectes aforesayd in all former ages and in the most ciuill 
countreys and common wealthes, good Poets and Poesie were highly 
esteemed and much fauoured of the greatest Princes. For proofe whereof we 
read how much <hi>Amyntas</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia</hi> made of the 
Tragicall Poet <hi>Euripides</hi>. And the <hi>Athenians</hi> of 
<hi>Sophocles</hi>. In what price the noble poemes of <hi>Homer</hi> were 
holden with <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, in so much as euery night they were 
layd vnder his pillow, and by day were carried in the rich iewell cofer of 
<hi>Darius</hi> lately before vanquished by him in battaile. And not onely 
<hi>Homer</hi> the father and Prince of the Poets was so honored by him, but 
for his sake all other meaner Poets, in so much as <hi>Cherillus</hi> one no 
very great good Poet had for euery verse well made a <hi>Phillips</hi> noble of 
gold, amounting in value to an angell English, and so for euery hundreth 
verses (which a cleanely pen could speedely dispatch) he had a hundred 
angels. And since <hi>Alexander</hi> the great how <hi>Theocritus</hi> the 
Greeke Poet was fauored by <hi>Tholomee</hi> king of Egipt &amp; Queene 
<hi>Berenice</hi> his wife, <hi>Ennius</hi> likewise by <hi>Scipio</hi> Prince of 
the <hi>Romaines, Virgill</hi> also by th'Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi>. And in 
later times how much were <hi>Iehan de Menune &amp; Guillaume de Loris</hi>
made of by the French kinges, and <hi>Geffrey Chaucer</hi> father of our 
English Poets by <hi>Richard</hi> the second, who as it was supposed gaue him 
the maner of new Holme in Oxfordshire. And <hi>Gower</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth and <hi>Harding</hi> to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. Also how 
<hi>Frances</hi> the Frenche king made <hi>Sangelais, Salmonius, Macrinus</hi>, 
and <hi>Clement Marot</hi> of his priuy Chamber for their excellent skill in 
vulgare and Latine Poesie. And king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8 her <hi>Maiesties</hi>
father for a few Psalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> turned into English meetre by 
Sternhold, made him groome of his priuy chamber, &amp; gaue him many 
other good gifts. And one <hi>Gray</hi> what good estimation did he grow vnto 
with the same king <hi>Henry</hi> &amp; afterward with the Duke of 
Sommerset Protectour, for making certaine merry Ballades, whereof one 
chiefly was, <hi>The hunte is up, the hunte is up</hi>. And Queene <hi>Mary</hi>
his daughter for one <hi>Epithalamie</hi>
                  <pb n="13"/>
or nuptiall song made by <hi>Vargas</hi> a Spanish Poet at her 
mariage with king <hi>Phillip</hi> in Winchester gaue him during his life two 
hundred Crownes pension: nor this reputation was giuen them in auncient 
times altogether in respect that Poesie was a delicate arte, and the Poets 
them selues cunning Princepleasers, but for that also they were thought for 
their vniversall knowledge to be vary sufficient men for the greatest 
charges in their common wealthes, were it for counsell or for conduct, 
whereby no man neede to doubt but that both skilles may very well concurre 
and be most excellent in one person. For we finde that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
the first Emperour and a most noble Captaine, was not onely the most 
eloquent Orator of his time, but also a very good Poet, though none of his 
doings therein be now extant. And <hi>Quintus Catalus</hi> a good Poet, and 
<hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> treasurer of Egipt, and <hi>Horace</hi> the most 
delicate of all the Romain <hi>Lyrickes</hi>, was thought meete and by many 
letters of great instance prouoked to be Secretarie of estate to 
<hi>Augustus</hi> th'Emperour, which neuertheless he refused for his 
vnhealthfulnesse sake, and being a quiet mynded man and nothing ambitious 
of glory: <hi>non voluit accedere ad Rempublicam</hi>, as it is reported. And 
<hi>Ennius</hi> the Latine Poet was not as some perchaunce thinke, onely 
fauored by <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Africane</hi> for his good making of verses, 
but vsed as his familiar and Counsellor in the warres for his great 
knowledge and amiable conuersation. And long before that 
<hi>Antimenides</hi> and other Greeke Poets, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reportes in 
his Politiques, had charge in the warres. And <hi>Tyrteus</hi> the Poet being 
also a lame man &amp; halting vpon one legge, was chosen by the Oracle of 
the gods from the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be generall of the 
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> armie, not for his Poetrie, but for his wisedome and 
graue perswasions, and subtile Stratagemes whereby he had the victory ouer 
his enemies. So as the Poets seemed to haue skill not onely in the subtilties 
of their arte, but also to be meete for all maner of functions ciuill and 
martiall, euen as they found fauour of the times they liued in, insomuch as 
their credit and estimation generally was not small. But in these dayes 
(although some learned Princes may take delight in them) yet vniversally it 
is not so. For as well Poets and Poesie are despised, &amp; the name 
become, of honorable infamous, subiect to scorne and derision, <pb n="14"/>
and rather a reproch than a prayse to any that vseth it: for commonly 
who so is studious in th'Arte or shewes him selfe excellent in it, they call 
him in disdayne a <hi>phantasticall</hi>: and a light headed or phantasticall 
man (by conuersion) they call a Poet. And this proceedes through he 
barbarous ignoraunce of the time, and pride of many Gentlemen, and others, 
whose grosse heads not being brought vp or acquainted with any excellent 
Arte, nor able to contriue, or in manner conceiue any matter of subtiltie in 
any businesse or science, they doe deride and scorne it in all others as 
superfluous knowledges and vayne sciences, and whatsoeuer deuise be of 
rare inuention they terme it <hi>phantasticall</hi>, construing it to the worst 
side and among men such as be modest and graue, &amp; of litel 
conuersation, nor delighted in the busie life and vayne ridiculous actions of 
the popular, they call him in scorne a <hi>Philosopher</hi> or <hi>Poet</hi>, as 
much as to say as a phantasticall man, very iniuriously (God wot) and to the 
manifestation of their own ignoraunce, not making difference betwixt 
termes. For as the euill and vicious disposition of the braine hinders the 
sounde iudgement and discourse of man with busie &amp; disordered 
phantasies, for which cause the Greekes call him <foreign xml:lang="el">faitasikos</foreign>, so is 
that part being well affected, not onely nothing disorderly or confused with 
any monstruous imaginations or conceits, but very formall, and in his much 
multiformitie <hi>uniforme</hi>, that is well proportioned, and so passing 
cleare, that by it as by a glasse or mirrour, are represented vnto the soule 
all maner of bewtifull visions, whereby the inuentiue parte of the mynde is 
so much holpen, as without it not man could deuise any new or rare thing: 
and where it is not excellent in his kind, there could be no politique 
Captaine, nor any witty engineer or cunning artificer, nor yet any law maker 
or counsellor of deepe discourse, yea the Prince of Philosophers stickes not 
to say <hi>animam no intelligere absque phantasmate</hi>, which text to 
another purpose <hi>Alexander Aphrodiseus</hi> well noteth, as learned men 
know. And this phantasie may be resembled to a glasse as hath bene sayd, 
whereof there be many tempers and manner of makinges, as the 
<hi>perspectiues</hi> doe acknowledge, for some be false glasses and shew 
thinges otherwise than they be in deede, and others right as they be in 
deede, neither fairer nor fouler, nor greater nor smaller. There be againe of 
these <pb n="15"/>
glasses that shew thinges exceeding faire and comely, others that shew 
figures very monstrous &amp; illfauored. Euen so is the phantasticall part 
of man (if it be not disordered) a representer of the best, most comely and 
bewtifull images or apparances of thinges to the soule and according to 
their very truth. If otherwise, then doth it breede <hi>Chimeres</hi> &amp; 
monsters in mans imaginations, &amp; not onely in his imaginations, but 
also in all his ordinarie actions and life which ensues. Wherefore such 
persons as be illuminated with the brightest irradiations of knowledge and 
of the veritie and due proportion of things, they are called by the learned 
men not <hi>phantastici</hi> but <hi>euphantasiote</hi>, and of this sorte of 
phantasie are all good Poets, notable Captaines stratagematique, all cunning 
artificers and enginers, all Legislators Polititiens &amp; Counsellours of 
estate, in whose exercises the inuentiue part is most employed and is to the 
sound &amp; true iudgement of man most needful. This diuersitie in the 
termes perchance euery man hath not noted, &amp; thus much be said in 
defence of the Poets honour, to the end no noble and generous minde be 
discomforted in the studie thereof, the rather for that worthy &amp; 
honorable memoriall of that noble woman twise French Queene, Lady 
<hi>Anne</hi> of Britaine, wife first to king <hi>Charles</hi> the viii. and after 
to <hi>Lewes</hi> the xii. who passing one day from her lodging toward the 
kinges side, saw in a gallerie <hi>Maister Allaine Chartier</hi> the kings 
Secretarie, an excellent maker or Poet leaning on a tables end a sleepe, 
&amp; stooped downe to kiss him, saying thus in all their hearings, we may 
not of Princely courtesie passe by and not honor with our kisse the mouth 
from whence so many sweete ditties &amp; golden poems haue issued. But 
me thinks at these words I heare some smilingly say, I would be loath to 
lacke liuing of my own till the Prince gaue me a maner of new Elme for my 
riming. And another to say I haue read that the Lady <hi>Cynthia</hi> came 
once downe out of her skye to kiss the faire yong lad <hi>Endimion</hi> as he 
lay a sleep: &amp; many noble Queenes that haue bestowed kisses vpon their 
Princes paramours, but neuer vpon any Poets. The third me thinks 
shruggingly saith, I kept not to sit sleeping with my Poesie till a Queene 
came and kissed me. but what of all this? Princes may giue a good Poet 
such countenaunce and also benefite as are due to an excellent artificer, 
though they neither <pb n="16"/>
kisse nor cokes them, and the discret Poet lookes for no such 
extraordinarie fauors, and aswell doth he honour by his pen the iust, 
liberall, or magnanimous Prince, as the valiaunt, amiable or bewtifull though 
they be euery one of them the good giftes of God. So it seemes not 
altogether the scorne and ordinarie disgrace offered vnto Poets at these 
dayes, is cause why few Gentlemen do delight in the Art, but for that 
liberalitie, is come to sayle in Princes, who for their largesse were wont to 
be accompted th'onley patrons of learning, and first founders of all 
excellent artificers. Besides it is not perceiued, that Princes them selues 
do take any pleasure in this science, by whose example the subiect is 
commonly led, and allured to all delights and exercises be they good or bad, 
according to the graue saying of the historian. <hi>Rex multitudinem 
religione impleuit, quae semper regenti similis est</hi>. And peraduenture in 
this iron &amp; malitious age of ours, Princes are lesse delighted in it, 
being ouer earnestly bent and affected to the affaires of Empire &amp; 
ambition, whereby they are as it were inforced to indeuour them selues to 
armes and practises of hostilitie, or to entend to the right pollicing of their 
states, and haue not one houre to bestow vpon any other ciuill or delectable 
Art of naturall or morall doctrine: nor scarce any leisure to thincke one 
good thought in perfect and godly contemplation, whereby their troubled 
mindes might be moderated and brought to tranquillitie. So as, it is hard to 
find in these dayes of noblemen or gentlemen any good <hi>Mathematician</hi>, 
or excellent <hi>Musitian</hi>, or notable <hi>Philosopher</hi>, or els a cunning 
Poet: because we find few great Princes much delighted in the same 
studies. Now also of such among the Nobilitie or gentrie as be very well 
seene in many laudable sciences, and especially in making or Poesie, it is so 
come to passe that they haue no courage to write &amp; if they haue, yet are 
they loath to be a knowen of their skill. So as I know very many notable 
Gentlemen in the Court that haue written commendable, and suppressed it 
agayne, or else suffred it to be publisht without their owne names to it: as 
if it were a discredit for a Gentleman, to seeme learned, and to shew 
himselfe amorous of any good Art. In other ages it was not so, for we read 
that Kinges &amp; Princes haue written great volumes and publisht them 
vnder their own regall titles. As to begin with <hi>Salomon</hi> the wisest <pb n="17"/>
of Kings, <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> the greatest of Emperours, <hi>Hermes 
Trismegistus</hi> the holiest of Priestes and Prophetes, <hi>Euax</hi> king of 
<hi>Arabia</hi> wrote a booke of precious stones in verse, Prince 
<hi>Auicenna</hi> of Phisicke and Philosophie, <hi>Alphonsus</hi> king of Spaine 
his Astronomicall Tables, <hi>Almansor</hi> a king of <hi>Marrocco</hi> diuerse 
Philosophicall workes, and by their regal example our late soueraigne Lord 
king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight wrote a booke in defence of his faith, then 
perswaded that it was the true and Apostolicall doctrine, though it hath 
appeared otherwise since, yet his honour and learned zeale was nothing 
lesse to be allowed. Queenes also haue bene knowen studious, and to write 
large volumes, as Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> of Fraunce Queene of <hi>Nauarre</hi>
ion our time. But of all others the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> was so well learned 
in Musique and Poesie, as when he was taken by order of the Senate and 
appointed to dye, he offered violence to him selfe and sayd, <hi>O quantus 
artivex pereo!</hi> as much to say, as, how is it possible a man of such 
science and learning as my selfe, should come to this shamefull death? 
Th'emperour <hi>Octavian</hi> being made executor to <hi>Virgill</hi>, who had 
left by his last will and testament, that his bookes of the <hi>Aeneidos</hi>
should be committed to the fire as things not perfited by him, made his 
excuse for infringing the deads will, by a nomber of verses most excellently 
written whereof these are part.

ciuill arts, &amp; not ashamed to bewray their skils in the same, let none 
other meaner person despise learning, nor (whether it haue written any

               <head>How Poesie should not be imployed upon vayne conceits or vicious or infamous.</head>
               <p>Wherefore the Nobilitie and dignitie of the Art considered aswell by 
vniuersalitie as antiquitie and the naturall excellence of it selfe, Poesie 
ought not to be abashed and imployed vpon any vnworthy matter &amp; 
subiect, nor vsed to vaine purposes, which neuerthelesse is dayly seene, and 
that is to vtter conceits infamous &amp; vicious or ridiculous and foolish, 
or of no good example &amp; doctrine. Albeit in merry matters (not 
vnhonest) being vsed for mans solace and recreation it may be well allowed, 
for as I said before, Poesie is a pleasant maner of vtterance varying from 
the ordinarie of purpose to refresh the mynde by the eares delight. Poesie 
also is not onely laudable, because I said it was a metricall speach vsed by 
the first men, but because it is a metricall speach corrected and reformed 
by discreet iudgements, and with no lesse cunning and curiositie then the 
Greeke and Latine Poesie, and by Art bewtified &amp; adorned, &amp; 
brought far from the primitiue rudenesse of the first inuentors, otherwise 
it might be sayd to me that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eues</hi> apernes were the 
gayest garmentes, because they were the first, and the shepheardes tente or 
pauillion, the best housing, because it was the most auncient &amp; most 
vniuersall: which I would not haue so taken, for it is not my meaning but 
that Art &amp; cunning concurring with nature, antiquitie &amp; 
vniuersalitie, in things indifferent, and not euill, doe make them more 
laudable. And right so our vulgar riming Poesie, being by good wittes 
brought to that perfection we see, is worthily to be preferred before any 
other maner of vtterance in prose, for such vse and to such purpose as it is 
ordained, and shall hereafter be set downe more particularly.

               <p>Hauing sufficiently sayd of the dignitie of Poets and Poesie, now it is tyme 
to speake of the matter of subiect of Poesie, which to myne intent is, what 
soeuer wittie and delicate conceit of man meet or worthy to be put in 
written verse, for any necessary vse of the present time, or good 
instruction of the posteritie. <pb n="19"/>
But the chief and principall is: the laud honour &amp; glory of the 
immortall gods (I speake now in phrase of the Gentiles.) Secondly the 
worthy gests of noble Princes: the memoriall and registry of all great 
fortunes, the praise of vertue &amp; reproofe of vice, the instruction of 
morall doctrines, the reuealing of sciences naturall &amp; other profitable 
Arts, the redresse of boistrous &amp; sturdie courages by perswasion, the 
consolation and repose of temperate myndes, finally the common solace of 
mankind in all his trauails and cares of this transitorie life. And in this 
last sort being vsed for recreation onely, may allowably beare matter not 
alwayes of the grauest, or of any great commoditie or profit, but rather in 
some sort, vaine, dissolute, or wanton, so it be not very scandalous &amp; of 
euill example. But as our intent is to make this Art vulgar for all English 
mens vse, &amp; therefore are of necessitie to set downe the principal rules 
therein to be obserued: so in mine opinion it is no lesse expedient to touch 
briefly all the chief points of this auncient Poesie of the Greeks and 
Latines, so far forth as it is conformeth with ours. So as it may be knowen 
what we hold of them as borrowed, and what as of our owne peculiar. 
Wherefore now that we haue said, what is the matter of Poesie, we will 
declare the manner and formes of poemes vsed by the auncients.

               <head>Of poemes and their sundry formes and how thereby the auncient Poets receaued surnames.</head>
               <p>As the matter of Poesie is diuers, so was the forme of their poemes &amp; 
maner of writing, for all of them wrote not in one sort, euen as all of them 
wrote not vpon one matter. Neither was euery Poet alike cunning in all as in 
some one kinde of Poesie, nor vttered with like felicitie. But wherein any 
one most excelled, thereof he tooke a surname, as to be called a Poet 
<hi>Heroick, Lyrick, Elegiack, Epigramatist</hi> or otherwise. Such therefore 
as gaue them selues to write long histories of the noble gests of kings 
&amp; great Princes entermedling the dealings of the gods, halfe gods or 
<hi>Heroes</hi> of the gentiles, &amp; the great &amp; waighty consequences 
of peace and warre, they called Poets <hi>Heroick</hi>, whereof <hi>Homer</hi>
was chief and most auncient among the Greeks, <hi>Virgill</hi> among the 
Latines: <pb n="20"/>
Others who more delighted to write songs or ballads of pleasure, to be song 
with the voice, and to the harpe, lute, or citheron &amp; such other musical, 
instruments, they were called melodious Poets [<hi>melici</hi>] or by a more 
common name <hi>Lirique</hi> Poets, of which sort was <hi>Pindarus, 
Anacreon</hi> and <hi>Callimachus</hi> with others among the Greeks: 
<hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> among the Latines. There were an other 
sort, who sought the fauor of faire Ladies, and deuoted to bemone their 
estates at large, &amp; the perplexities of loue in a certain pitious verse 
called <hi>Elegie</hi>, and thence were called <hi>Eligiack</hi>: such among the 
Latines were <hi>Ouid, Tibullus, &amp; Propertius</hi>. There were also Poets 
that wrote onely for the stage, I means playes and interludes, to recreate 
the people with matters of disporte, and to that intent did set forth in 
shewes &amp; pageants, accompanied with speach the common behauiours 
and maner of life of priuate persons, and such as were the meaner sort of 
men, and they were called <hi>Comicall</hi> Poets, of whom among the 
Greekes <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Aristophanes</hi> were most excellent, with 
the Latines <hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Plautus</hi>. Besides those Poets 
<hi>Comick</hi> there were other who serued also the stage, but medled not 
with so base matters: For they set forth the dolefull falles of infortunate 
&amp; afflicted Princes, &amp; were called Poets <hi>Tragicall</hi>. Such 
were <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> with the Greeks, <hi>Seneca</hi>
among the Latines. There were yet others who mounted nothing so high as 
any of them both, but in base and humble stile by maner of Dialogue, vttered 
the priuate and familiar talke of the meanest sort of men, as shepheards, 
heywards and such like, such was among the Greekes <hi>Theocritus</hi>: and 
<hi>Virgill</hi> among the Latines, their poemes were named <hi>Eglogues</hi>
or shepheardly talke. There was yet another kind of Poet, who intended to 
taxe the common abuses and vice of the people in rough and bitter speaches, 
and their inuectiues were called <hi>Satyres</hi>, and them selues 
<hi>Satyricques</hi>. Such were <hi>Lucilius, Iuuenall</hi> and <hi>Persius</hi>
among the Latines, &amp; with vs that wrote the booke called Piers 
plowman. Others of a more fine and pleasant head were giuen wholly to 
taunting and scoffing at vndecent things, and in short poemes vttered pretie 
merry conceits, and these men were called <hi>Epigrammatistes</hi>. There 
were others that for the peoples good instruction, and triall of their owne 
witts vsed in places of great assembly, to <pb n="21"/>
say by rote nombers of short and sententious meetres, very pithie and of 
good edification, and thereupon were called Poets <hi>Mimistes</hi>: as who 
would say, imitable and meet to be followed for their wise and graue 
lessons. There was another kind of poeme, inuented onely to make sport, 
&amp; to refresh the company with a maner of buffonry or counterfaiting of 
merry speaches, comuerting all that which they had hard spoken before, to a 
certaine derision by a quite contrary sence, and this was done, when 
<hi>Comedies</hi> or <hi>Tragedies</hi> were a playing, &amp; that betweene the 
actes when the players went to make ready for another, there was great 
silence, and the people waxt weary, then came in these maner of 
counterfaite vices, they were called <hi>Pantomimi</hi>, and all that had 
before bene sayd, or great part of it, they gaue a crosse construction to it 
very ridiculously. Thus haue you how the names of the Poets were giuen 
them by the formes of their poemes and maner of writing.

               <head>In what forme of Poesie the gods of the Gentiles were praysed and honored.</head>
               <p>The gods of the Gentiles were honoured by their Poetes in hymnes, which is 
an extraordinarie and diuine praise, extolling and magnifying them for their 
great powers and excellencie of nature in the highest degree of laude, and 
yet therein their Poets were after a sort restrained: so as they could not 
with their credit vntruly praise their owne gods, or vse in their lauds any 
maner of gross adulation or vnueritable report. For in any writer vntruth 
and flatterie are counted most great reproches. Wherfore to praise the gods 
of the Gentiles, for that by authoritie of their owne fabulous records, they 
had fathers and mothers, and kinred and allies, and wiues and concubines: 
the Poets first commended them by their genealogies or pedegrees, their 
mariages and aliances, their notable exploits in the world for the behoofe of 
mankind, and yet as I sayd before, none otherwise then the truth of their 
owne memorials might beare, and in such sort as it might be well auouched 
by their old written reports, though in very deede they were not from the 
beginning all historically true, and many of them verie fictions, and such of 
them as were true, were grounded vpon some <pb n="22"/>
part of an historie or matter of veritie, the rest altogether figuratiue &amp; 
misticall, couertly applied to some morall or naturall sense, as 
<hi>Cicero</hi> setteth it foorth in his bookes <hi>de natura deorum</hi>. For to 
say that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was sonne to <hi>Saturne</hi>, and that he maried his 
owne sister <hi>Iuno</hi>, might be true, for such was the guise of all great 
Princes in the Orientall part of the world both at those dayes and now is. 
Againe that he loued <hi>Danae, Europa, Leda, Calisto</hi> &amp; other faire 
Ladies daughters to kings, besides many meaner women, it is likely enough, 
because he was reported to be a very incontinent person, and giuen ouer to hi 
lustes, as are for the most part all the greatest Princes, but that he should 
be the highest god in heauen, or that he should thunder and lighten, and do 
manie other things very vnnaturally and absurdly: also that <hi>Saturnius</hi>
should geld his father <hi>Celius</hi> to th'intent to make him vnable to get 
any moe children, and other such matters as are reported by them, it 
seemeth to be some wittie deuise and fiction made for a purpose, or a very 
notable and impudent lye, which could not be reasonably suspected by the 
Poets, who were otherwise discreete and graue men, and teachers of 
wisedome to others. Therefore either to transgresse the rules of their 
primitiue records, or to seeke to giue their gods honour by belying them 
(otherwise then in that sence which I haue alledged) had bene a signe not 
onely of an vnskilfull Poet, but also of a very impudent and leude man. For 
vntrue praise neuer giueth any true reputation. But with vs Christians, who 
be better disciplined, and do acknowledge but one God Almightie, 
euerlasting, and in euery respect selfe suffizant [<hi>autharcos</hi>] reposed 
in all perfect rest &amp; soueraigne blisse, not needing or exacting any 
forreine helpe or good. To him we can not exhibit ouermuch praise, nor belye 
him any wayes, vnlesse it be in abasing his excellencie by scarsitie of 
praise, or by misconceauing his diuine nature, weening to praise him, if we 
impute to him such vaine delights and peeuish affections, as commonly the 
frailest men are reproued for. Namely to make him ambitious of honour, 
iealous and difficult in his worships, terrible, angrie, vindicatiue, a louer, a 
hater, a pitier, and indigent of mans worships: finally so passionate as in 
effect he shold be altogether <hi>Anthropapathis</hi>. To the gods of the 
Gentiles they might well attribute these infirmities, for they were but the 
children <pb n="23"/>
of men, great Princes and famous in the world, and not for any other 
respect diuine, then by some resemblance of vertue they had to do good, and 
to benefite many. So as to the God of the Christians, such diuine praise 
might be verified: to th'other gods none, but figuratiuely or in misticall 
sense as hath bene said. In which sort the ancient Poets did in deede giue 
them great honors &amp; praises, and made to them sacrifices, &amp; offred 
them oblations of sundry sortes, euen as the people were taught and 
perswaded by such placations and worships to receaue any helpe, comfort or 
benefite to them selues, their wiues, children, possessions or goods. For if 
that opinion were not, who would acknowledge any God? the verie 
<hi>Etimologie</hi> of the name with vs of the North partes of the world 
declaring plainely the nature of the attribute, which is all one as if we sayd 
good, [<hi>bonus</hi>] or a giuer of good things. Therefore the Gentiles prayed 
for peace to the goddesse <hi>Pallas</hi>: for warre (such as thriued by it) to 
the god <hi>Mars</hi>: for honor and empire to the god <hi>Iupiter</hi>: for 
riches &amp; wealth to <hi>Pluto</hi>: for eloquence and gayne to 
<hi>Mercurie</hi>: for safe nauigation to <hi>Neptune</hi>: for faire weather 
and prosperous windes to <hi>Eolus</hi>: for skill in musick and leechcraft to 
<hi>Apollo</hi>: for free life &amp; chastitie to <hi>Diana</hi>: for bewtie and 
good grace, as also for issue &amp; prosperitie in loue to <hi>Venus</hi>: for 
plenty of crop and corne to <hi>Ceres</hi>: for seasonable vintage to 
<hi>Bacchus</hi>: and for other things to others. So many things as they could 
imagine good and desirable, and to so many gods as they supposed to be 
authors thereof, in so much as <hi>Fortune</hi> was made a goddesse, &amp; 
the feuer quartaine had her aulters, such blindnes &amp; ignorance raigned 
in the harts of men at that time, and whereof it first proceeded and grew, 
besides th'opinion hath bene giuen, appeareth more at large in our bookes of 
<hi>Ierotekni</hi> the matter being of another consideration then to be treated 
of in this worke. And these hymnes to the gods was the first forme of 
Poesie and the highest &amp; the stateliest, &amp; they were song by the 
Poets as priests, and by the people or whole congregation as we sing in our 
Churchs the Psalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi>, but they did it commonly in some 
shadie groues of tall tymber trees: In which places they reared aulters of 
greene turfe, and bestrewed them all ouer with flowers, and vpon them 
offred their oblations and made their bloudy sacrifices, <pb n="24"/>
(for no kinde of gift can be dearer then life) of such quick cattaile, 
as euery god was in their conceit most delighted in, or in some other 
respect most for the misterie: temples or churches or other chappels then 
these they had none at those dayes.

               <head>In what forme of Poesie vice and the common abuses of mans life was reprehended.</head>
               <p>Some perchance would thinke that next after the praise and honouring of 
their gods, should commence the worshippings and praise of good men, and 
specially of great Princes and gouernours of the earth in soueraignety and 
function next vnto the gods. But it is not so, for before that came to passe, 
the Poets or holy Priests, chiefly studied the rebuke of vice, and to carpe 
tat the common abuses, such as were most offensiue to the publique and 
priuate, for as yet for lack of good ciuility and wholesome doctrines, there 
was greater store of lewde lourdaines then of wise and learned Lords, or of 
noble and vertuous Princes and gouernours. So as next after the honours 
exhibited to their gods, the Poets finding in man generally much to reproue 
&amp; litle to praise, made certaine poems in plaine meetres, more like to 
sermons or preachings then otherwise, and when the people were assembled 
togither in those hallowed placed dedicate to their gods, because they had 
yet no large halles or places of conuenticle, nor had any other correction of 
their faults, but such as rested onely in rebukes of wise and graue men, such 
as at these dayes make the people ashamed rather then afeard, the said 
auncient Poets vsed for that purpose, three kinds of poems reprehensiue, to 
wit, the <hi>Satyre</hi>, the <hi>Comedie</hi>, &amp; the <hi>Tragedie</hi>: and 
the first and most bitter inuectiue against vice and vicious men, was the 
<hi>Satyre</hi>: which to th'intent their bitternesse should breede none ill 
will, either to the Poets, or to the recitours, (which could not haue bene 
chosen if they had bene openly knowen) and besides to make their 
admonitions and reproofs seeme grauer and of more efficacie, they made 
wise as if the gods of the woods, whom they called <hi>Satyres</hi> or 
<hi>Siluanes</hi>, should appeare and recite those verses of rebuke, whereas 
in deed they were but disguised persons vnder the shape of <hi>Satyres</hi>
                  <pb n="25"/>
who would say, these terrene and base gods being conuersant with 
mans affaires, and spiers out of all their secret faults: had some great care 
ouer man, &amp; desired by good admonitions to reforme the euill of their 
life, and to being the bad to amendment by those kinde of preachings, 
whereupon the Poets inuentours of the deuise were called <hi>Satyristes</hi>.

               <head>How vice was afterward reproued by two other maner of poems, better reformed then the Satyre, whereof the first was Comedy, the second <hi>Tragedie</hi>.</head>
               <p>Bvt when these maner of solitary speaches and recitals of rebuke, vttered 
by the rurall gods out of bushes and briers, seemed not to the finer heads 
sufficiently perswasiue, nor so popular as if it were reduced into action of 
many persons, or by many voyces liuely represented to the eare and eye, so 
as a man might thinke it were euen now a doing. The Poets deuised to haue 
many parts played at once by two or three or foure persons, that debated the 
matters of the world, sometimes of their owne priuate affaires, sometimes 
of their neighbours, but neuer medling with any Princes matters nor such 
high personages, but commonly of marchants, souldiers, artificers, good 
honest housholders, and also of vnthrifty youthes, yong damsels, old nurses, 
bawds, brokers, ruffians and parasites, with such like, in whose behauiors, 
lyeth in effect the whole course and trade of mans life, and therefore tended 
altogether to the good amendment of man by discipline and example. It was 
also much for the solace &amp; recreation of the common people by reason 
of the pageants and shewes. And this kind of poeme was called 
<hi>Comedy</hi>, and followed next after the <hi>Satyre</hi>, &amp; by that 
occasion was somwhat sharpe and bitter after the nature of the 
<hi>Satyre</hi>, openly &amp; by expresse names taxing men more maliciously 
and impudently then became, so as they were enforced for feare of quarell 
&amp; blame to disguise their players with strange apparell, and by 
colouring their faces and carying hatts &amp; capps of diuerse fashions to 
make them selues lesse knowen. But as time &amp; experience do reforme 
euery thing that is amisse, so this bitter poeme called the old 
<hi>Comedy</hi>, being disused and taken away, the <pb n="26"/>
new <hi>Comedy</hi> came in place, more ciuill and pleasant a great deale and 
not touching any man by name, but in a certain generalitie glancing at euery 
abuse, so as from thenceforth fearing none ill-will or enmitie at any bodies 
hands, they left aside their disguisings &amp; played bare face, till one 
<hi>Roscius Gallus</hi> the most excellent player among the Romaines brought 
vp these vizards, which we see at this day vsed, partly to supply the want of 
players, when there were moe parts then there were persons, or that it was 
not thought meet to trouble &amp; pester princes chambers with too many 
folkes. Now by the chaunge of a vizard one man might play the king and the 
carter, the old nurse &amp; the yong damsell, the marchant &amp; the 
souldier or any other part he lifted very conueniently. There be that say 
<hi>Roscius</hi> did it for another purpose, for being him selfe the best 
<hi>Histrien</hi> or buffon that was in his dayes to be found, insomuch as 
<hi>Cicero</hi> said <hi>Roscius</hi> contended with him by varietie of liuely 
gestures to surmount the copy of his speach, yet because he was squint eyed 
and had a very vnpleasant countenance, and lookes which made him 
ridiculous or rather odious to the presence, he deuised these vizards to hide 
his owne ilfauored face. And thus much touching the <hi>Comedy</hi>.

               <head>In what forme of Poesie the euill and outragious bahauiours of Princes were reprehended.</head>
               <p>Bvt because in those dayes when the Poets first taxed by <hi>Satyre</hi> and 
<hi>Comedy</hi>, there was no great store of Kings or Emperors or such high 
estats (al men being yet for the most part rude, &amp; in a maner popularly 
egall) they could not say of them or of their behauiours any thing to the 
purpose, which cases of Princes are sithens taken for the highest and 
greatest matters of all. But after that some men among the moe became 
mighty and famous in the world, soueraignetie and dominion hauing learned 
them all maner of lusts and licentiousnes of life, by which occasions also 
their high estates and felicities fell many times into most lowe and 
lamentable fortunes: whereas before in their great prosperities they were 
both feared and reuerenced in the highest degree, after their deathes when 
the posteritie stood no more in dread of them, <pb n="27"/>
their infamous life and tyrannies were layd open to all the world, their 
wickednes reproched, their follies and extreme insolencies derided, and 
their miserable ends painted out in playes and pageants, to shew the 
mutabilitie of fortune, and the iust punishment of God in reuenge of a 
vicious and euill life. These matters were also handled by the Poets and 
represented by action as that of the <hi>Comedies</hi>: but because the 
matter was higher then that of the <hi>Comedies</hi> the Poets stile was also 
higher and more loftie, the prouision greater, the place more magnificent: 
for which purpose also the players garments were made more rich &amp; 
costly and solemne, and euery other thing aperteining, according to that 
rate: so as where the <hi>Satyre</hi> was pronounced by rusticall and naked 
<hi>Syluanes</hi> speaking out of a bush, &amp; the common players of 
interludes called <hi>Plampedes</hi>, played barefoote vpon the floore: the 
later <hi>Comedies</hi> vpon scaffolds, and by men well and cleanely hofed 
and shod. These matters of great Princes were played vpon lofty stages, 
&amp; the actors thereof ware vpon their leges buskins of leather called 
<hi>Cothurni</hi>, and other solemne habits, &amp; for a speciall preheminence 
did walke vpon those high corked shoes or pantofles, which now they call in 
Spaine &amp; Italy <hi>Shoppini</hi>. And because those buskins and high 
shoes were commonly made of goats skinnes very finely tanned, and dyed 
into colours: or for that as some say the best players reward, was a goate 
to be giuen him, or for that as other thinke, a goate was the peculiar 
sacrifice to the god <hi>Pan</hi>, king of all the gods of the woodes: 
forasmuch as a goate in Greeke is called <hi>Tragos</hi>, therfore these 
stately playes were called <hi>Tragedies</hi>. And thus haue ye foure sundry 
formes of Poesie <hi>Dramatick</hi> reprehensiue, &amp; put in execution by 
the seate &amp; dexteritie of mans body, to wit, the <hi>Satyre</hi>, old 
<hi>Comedie</hi>, new <hi>Comedie</hi>, and <hi>Tragedie</hi>, whereas all other

reprehension to others that were aliue, liuing in the same or like abuses. So 
was it great reason that all good and vertuous persons should for their well 
doings, be rewarded with commendation, and the great Princes aboue all 
others with honors and praises, being for many respects of greater moment, 
to haue them good &amp; vertuous then any inferior sort of men. Wherfore 
the Poets being in deede the trumpetters of all praise and also of slaunder 
(not slaunder, but well deserued reproch) were in conscience &amp; credit 
bound next after the diuine praises of the immortall gods, to yeeld a like 
ratable honour to all such amongst men, as most resembled the gods by 
excellencie of function, and had a certaine affinitie with them, by more then 
humane and ordinarie vertues shewed in their actions here vpon earth. They 
were therfore praised by a second degree of laude: shewing their high 
estates, their Princely genealogies and pedegrees, mariages, aliances, and 
such noble exploites, as they had done in th'affaires of peace &amp; of warre 
to the benefit of their people and countries, by inuention of any noble 
science, or profitable Art, or by making wholesome lawes or enlarging of 
their dominions by honorable and iust conquests, and many other wayes. 
Such personages among the Gentiles were <hi>Bacchus, Ceres, Perseus, 
Hercules, Theseus</hi> and many other, who thereby came to be accompted 
gods and halfe gods or goddesses [<hi>Heroes</hi>] &amp; had their 
commendations giuen by Hymne accordingly or by such other poems as their 
memorie was therby made famous to the posteritie for euer after, as shal be 
more at large sayd in place conuenient. But first we will speake somewhat 
of the playing places, and prouisions which were made for their pageants 
&amp; pomps representatiue before remembred.

               <head>Of the places where their enterludes or poemes drammaticke were represented to the people.</head>
               <p>As it hath bene declared, the <hi>Satyres</hi> were first vttered in their 
hallowed places within the woods where they honoured their <pb n="29"/>
gods vnder the open heauen, because they had no other housing fit for great 
assemblies. The old comedies were plaid in the broad streets vpon wagons 
or carts vncouered, which carts were floored with bords &amp; made for 
remouable stages to passe from one streete of their townes to another, 
where all the people might stand at their ease to gaze vpon the sights. 
Their new comedies or ciuill enterludes were played in open pauilions or 
tents of linnen cloth or lether, halfe displayed that the people might see. 
Afterward when Tragidies came vp they deuised to present them vpon 
scaffoldes or stages of timber, shadowed with linen or lether as the other, 
and these stages were made in the forme of a <hi>Semicircle</hi>, wherof the 
bow serued for the beholders to sit in, and the string or forepart was 
appointed for the floore or place where the players vttered, &amp; had in it 
sundry little diuisions by curteins as trauerses to serue for seueral roomes 
where they might repaire vnto &amp; change their garments &amp; come in 
againe, as their speaches &amp; parts were to be renewed. Also there was 
place appointed for the musiciens to sing or play vpon their instrumentes at 
the end of euery scene, to the intent the people might be refreshed, and kept 
occupied. This maner of stage in halfe circle, the Greekes called 
<hi>theatrium</hi>, as much to say as a beholding place, which was also in 
such sort contriued by benches and greeces to stand or sit vpon, as no man 
should empeach anothers sight. But as ciuilitie and withall wealth 
encreased, so did the minde of man growe dayly more haultie and superfluous 
in all his deuises, so as for their <hi>theaters</hi> in halfe circle, they came 
to be by the great magnificence of the Romain princes and people 
somptuously built with marble &amp; square stone in forme all round, &amp; 
were called <hi>Amphitheaters</hi>, wherof as yet appears one among the 
ancient ruines of Rome, built by <hi>Pompeius Magnus</hi>, for capasitie able 
to receiue at ease fourscore thousand persons as it is left written, &amp; so 
curiously contriued as euery man might depart at his pleasure, without any 
annoyance to other. It is also to be knowne that in those great 
<hi>Amphitheaters</hi>, were exhibited all maner of other shewes &amp; 
disports for the people, as their sence playes, or digladiations of naked men, 
their wrastlings, runnings, leapings and other practises or actiuitie and 
strength, also their baitings of wild beasts, as Elephants, Rhinocerons, 
Tiger, Leopards <pb n="30"/>
and others, which sights much delighted the common people, and therefore 
the places required to be large and of great content.

               <head>Of the Shepheards or pastorall Poesie called Eglogue, and to what purpose it was first inuented and used.</head>
               <p>Some be of opinion, and the chiefe of those who haue written in this Art 
among the Latines, that the pastorall Poesie which we commonly call by the 
name of <hi>Eglogue</hi> and <hi>Bucolick</hi>, a tearme brought in by the 
Sicilian Poets, should be the first of any others, and before the 
<hi>Satyre</hi> comedie or tragedie, because, say they, the shepheards and 
haywards assemblies &amp; meetings when they kept their cattell and 
heards in the common fields and forests, was the first familiar 
conuersation, and their babble and talk vnder bushes and shadie trees, the 
first disputation and contentious reasoning, and their fleshly heates 
growing of ease, the first idle wooings, and their songs made to their mates 
or paramours either vpon sorrow or iolity of courage, the first amorous 
musicks, sometime also they sang and played on their pipes for wagers, 
striuing who should get the best game, and be counted cunningest. All this I 
do agree vnto, for no doubt the shepheards life was the first example of 
honest felowship, their trade the first art of lawfull acquisition or 
purchase, for at those daies robbery was a manner of purchase. So saith 
<hi>Aristotle</hi> in his bookes of the Politiques, and that pasturage was 
before tillage, or fishing or fowling, or any other predatory art or 
cheuisance. And all this may be true, for before there was a shepheard 
keeper of his owne, or of some other bodies flocke, there was none owner in 
the world, quick cattel being the first property of any forreine possession. I 
say forreine, because alway men claimed property in their apparell and 
armour, and other like things made by their owne trauel and industry, nor 
thereby was there yet any good towne or city or Kings palace, where 
pageants and pompes might be shewed by Comedies or Tragedies. But for all 
this, I do deny that the <hi>Eglogue</hi> should be the first and most auncient 
forme of artificiall Poesie, being perswaded that the Poet deuised the 
<hi>Eglogue</hi> long after the other <hi>drammatick</hi> poems, not of purpose 
to counterfait or represent the <pb n="31"/>
rusticall manner of loues and communication: but vnder the vaile of homely 
persons, and in rude speeches to insinuate and glaunce at greater matters, 
and such as perchance had not bene safe to haue beene disclosed in any other 
sort, which may be perceiued by the Eglogues of <hi>Virgill</hi>, in which are 
treated by figure matters of greater importance then the loues of 
<hi>Titirus</hi> and <hi>Corydon</hi>. These Eglogues came after to containe and 
enforme morall discipline, for the amendment of mans behauiour, as be 
those of <hi>Mantuan</hi> and other moderne Poets.

               <head>Of historicall Poesie, by which the famous acts of Princes and the vertuous and worthy liues of our forefathers were reported.</head>
               <p>There is nothing in man of all the potential parts of his mind (reason will 
except) more noble or more necessary to the actiue life then memory: 
because it maketh most to a sound iudgement and perfect worldly wisedome, 
examining and comparing the times past with the present, and by them both 
considering the time to come, concludeth with a stedfast resolution, what 
is the best course to be taken in all his actions and aduices in thie world: it 
came vpon this reason, experience to be so highly commended in all 
consultations of importance, and preferred before any learning or science, 
and yet experience is no more than a masse of memories assembled, that is, 
such trials as man hath made in time before. Right so no kinde of argument 
in all the Oratorie craft, doth better perswade and more vniuersally satisfie 
then example, which is but the representation of old memories, and like 
successes happened in times past. For these regards the Poesie historicall 
is of all other next the diuine most honorable and worthy, as well for the 
common benefit as for the speciall comfort euery man receiueth by it. No 
one thing in the world with more delectation reuiuing our spirits then to 
behold as it were in a glasse the liuely image of our deare forefathers, their 
noble and vertuous maner of life, with other things autentike, which because 
we are not able otherwise to attaine to the knowledge of by any of our 
sences, we apprehend them by memory, whereas the present time and things <pb n="32"/>
so swiftly passe away, as they giue vs no leasure almost to looke into them, 
and much lesse to know &amp; consider of them throughly. The things 
future, being also euents very vncertaine, and such as can not possibly be 
knowne because they be not yet, can not be vsed for example nor for delight 
otherwise then by hope. Though many promise the contrary, by vaine and 
deceitfull arts taking vpon them to reueale the truth of accidents to come, 
which if it were so as they surmise, are yet but sciences meerely 
coniecturall, and not of any benefit to man or to the common wealth, where 
they be vsed or professed. Therefore the good and exemplarie things and 
actions of the former ages, were reserued only to the historicall reportes of 
wise and graue men: those of the present time left to the fruition and 
iudgement of our sences: the future as hazards and incertaine euentes 
vtterly neglected and layd aside for Magicians and mockers to get their 
liuings by: such manner of men as by negligence of Magistrates and 
remisses of lawes euery countrie breedeth great store of. These historical 
men neuerthelesse vsed not the matter so precisely to wish that al they 
wrote should be accounted true, for that was not needefull nor expedient to 
the purpose, namely to be vsed either for example or for pleasure: 
considering that many times it is seene a fained matter or altogether 
fabulous, besides that it maketh more mirth than any other, works no lesse 
good conclusions for example then the most true and veritable: but often 
times more, because the Poet hath the handling of them to fashion at his 
pleasure, but not so of th'other which must go according to their veritie 
&amp; none otherwise without the writers great blame. Againe as ye know 
mo and more excellent examples may fained in one day by a good wit, then 
many ages through mans frailtie are able to put in vse, which made the 
learned and wittie men of those times to deuise many historicall matters of 
no veritie at all, but with purpose to do good and no hurt, as vsing them for a 
maner of discipline and president of commendable life. Such was the 
common wealth of <hi>Plato</hi>, and Sir <hi>Thomas Moores Vtopia</hi>, 
resting all in deuise, but neuer put in execution, and easier to be wished 
then to be performed. And you shall perceiue that histories were of three 
sortes, wholly true and wholly false, and a third holding part of either, but 
for honest recreation, <pb n="33"/>
and good example they were all of them. And this may be apparent 
to vs not onely by the Poeticall histories, but also by those that be written 
in prose: for as <hi>Homer</hi> wrate a fabulous or mixt report of the siege of 
Troy, and another of <hi>Ulisses</hi> errors or wandrings, so did <hi>Museus</hi>
compile a true treatise of the life &amp; loues of <hi>Leander</hi> and 
<hi>Hero</hi>, both of them <hi>Heroick</hi>, and to none ill edification. Also as 
<hi>Theucidides</hi> wrate a worthy and veritable historie, of the warres 
betwixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Peloponeses</hi>: so did 
<hi>Zenophon</hi>, a most graue Philosopher, and well trained courtier and 
counsellour make another (but fained and vntrue) of the childhood of 
<hi>Cyrus</hi> king of <hi>Persia</hi>, neuertheles both to one effect, that is for 
example and good information of the posteritie. Now because the actions of 
meane &amp; base personages, tend in very few cases to any great good 
example: for who passeth to follow the steps, and maner of life of a craftes 
man, shepheard or sailer, though he were his father or dearest frend? yea 
how almost is ti possible that such maner of men should be of any vertue 
other then their profession requireth? Therefore was nothing committed to 
historie, but matters of great and excellent persons &amp; things that the 
same by irritation of good courages (such as emulation causeth) might 
worke more effectually, which occasioned the story writer to chuse an 
higher stile fit for his subiect, the Prosaicke in prose, the Poet in meetre, 
and the Poets was by verse exameter for his grauitie and statelinesse most 
allowable: neither would they intermingle him with any other sorter 
measure, vnlesse it were in matters of such qualitie, as became best to be 
song with the voyce, and to some musicall instrument, as were with the 
Greeks, all your Hymnes &amp; <hi>Encomia</hi> of <hi>Pindarus &amp; 
Callimachus</hi>, not very histories but a maner of historicall reportes in 
which cases they made those poemes in variable measures, &amp; coupled a 
short verse with a long to serue that purpose the better, and we our selues 
who compiled this treatise haue written for pleasure a litle brief 
<hi>Romance</hi> or historicall ditty in the English tong of the Isle of great 
<hi>Britaine</hi> in short and long meetres, and by breaches or diuisions to be 
more commodiously song to the harpe in places of assembly, where the 
company shalbe desirous to heare of old aduentures &amp; valiaunces of 
noble knights in times past, as are those of king <hi>Arthur</hi> and his 
knights <pb n="34"/>
of the round table, Sir <hi>Beuys</hi> of <hi>Southampton</hi>, <hi>Guy</hi> of 
<hi>Warwicke</hi> and others like. Such as haue not premonition hereof, and 
consideration of the causes alledged, would peraduenture reproue and 
disgrace euery <hi>Romance</hi>, or short historically ditty for that they be 
not written in long meeters or verses <hi>Alexandrina</hi>, according to the 
nature &amp; stile of large histories, wherin they should do wrong for they 
be sundry formes of poems and not all one.

               <head>In what forme of Poesie vertue in the inferiour sort was commended.</head>
               <p>In euerie degree and sort of men vertue is commendable, but not egally: not 
onely because mens estates are vnegall, but for that also vertue it selfe is 
not in euery respect of egall value and estimation. For continence in a king 
is of greater merit, than in a carter, th'one hauing all opportunities to allure 
him to lusts, and abilitie to serue his appetites, th'other partly, for the 
basenesse of his estate wanting such meanes and occasions, partly by dread 
of lawes more inhibited, and not so vehemently caried away with vnbridled 
affections, and therefore deserue not in th'one and th'other like praise nor 
equall reward, by the very ordinaries course of distributiue iustice. Euen so 
parsimonie and illiberalitie are greater vices in a Prince then in a priuate 
person, and pusillanimitie and iniustice likewise: for to th'one, fortune hath 
supplied inough to maintaine them in the contrarie vertues, I meane, 
fortitude, iustice, liberalitie, and magnanimitie: the Prince hauing all 
plentie to vse largesse by, and no want or neede to driue him to do wrong. 
Also all the aides that may be to lift vp his courage, and to make him stout 
and fearelesse (<hi>augent animos fortunae</hi>) saith the <hi>Mimist</hi>, and 
very truly, for nothing pulleth downe a mans heart so much as aduersitie and 
lacke. Againe in a meane man prodigalitie and pride are faultes more 
reprehensible then in Princes, whose high estates do require in their 
countenance, speech &amp; expense, a certaine extraordinary, and their 
functions enforce them sometime to exceede the limites of mediocritie not 
excusable in a priuat person, whose manner of life and calling hath no such 
exigence. Besides the good and bad of Princes is more exemplarie, and 
thereby of greater moment then <pb n="35"/>
the priuate persons. Therefore it is that the inferiour persons, with their 
inferiour vertues haue a certaine inferiour praise, to guerdon their good 
with, &amp; to comfort them to continue a laudable course in the modest and 
honest life and behauiour. But this lyeth not in written laudes so much as in 
ordinary reward and commendation to be giuen them by the mouth of the 
superiour magistrate. For histories were not intended to so generall and 
base a purpose, albeit many a meane souldier &amp; other obscure persons 
were spoken of and made famous in stories, as we finde of <hi>Irus</hi> the 
begger, and <hi>Thersites</hi> the glorious noddie, whom <hi>Homer</hi> maketh 
mention of. But that happened (&amp; so did many like memories of meane 
men) by reason of some greater personage or matter that it was long of, 
which therefore couldnot be an vniuersall case nor chaunce to euery other 
good and vertuous person of the meaner sort. Wherefore the Poet in praising 
the maner of life or death of anie meane person, did it by some litle dittie 
or Epigram or Epitaph in fewe verses &amp; meane stile conformable to his 
subiect. So haue you how heroicke personages by ballades of praise called 
<hi>Encomia</hi>, both of them by historicall reports of great grauitie and 
maiestie, the inferiour persons by other slight poemes.

               <head>In what forme of Poesie the amorous affections and allurements were uttered.</head>
               <p>The first founder of all good affections is hones loue, as the mother of all

commendable, yea honourable a thing as loue well meant, were it in Princely 
estate or priuate, might in all ciuil common wealths be vttered in good 
forme and order as other laudable things are. And because loue is of all 
other humane affections the most puissant and passionate, and most 
generall to all sortes and ages of men and women, so as whether it be of the 
yong or old or wise or holy, or high estate or low, none euer could truly 
bragge of any exemption in that case: it requireth a forme of Poesie 
variable, inconstant, affected, curious and most witty of any others, 
whereof the ioyes were to be vttered in one sorte, the sorrowes in an other, 
and by the many formes of Poesie, the many moodes and panges of louers, 
throughly to be discouered: the poore soules sometimes praying, beseeching, 
sometime honouring, auancing, praising: an other while railing, reuiling, and 
cursing: then sorrowing, weeping, lamenting: in the ende laughing, 
reioysing &amp; solacing the beloued againe, with a thousand delicate 
deuises, odes, songs, elegies, ballads, sonets and other ditties, moouing one

               <p>Pleasure is the chiefe parte of mans felicity in this world, and also (as our 
Theologians say) in the world to come. Therefore while we may (yea 
alwaies if it could be) to reioyce and take our pleasures in vertuous and 
honest sort, it is not only allowable, but also necessary and very naturall to 
man. And many be the ioyes and consolations of the hart: but none greater, 
than such as he may vtter and discouer by some conuenient meanes: euen as 
to suppresse and hide a mans mirth, and not to haue therein a partaker, or at 
least wise a witnes, is no little griefe and infelicity. Therfore nature and 
ciuility haue ordained (besides the priuate solaces) publike reioisings for the 
comfort and recreation of many. And <pb n="37"/>
they be of diuerse sorts and vpon diuerse occasions grown: one &amp; the 
chiefe was for the publike peace of a countrie the greatest of any other 
ciuill good. And wherein your Maiestie (my most gracious Soueraigne) haue 
shewed your selfe to all the world for this one and thirty yeares space of 
your glorious raigne, aboue all other Princes of Christendome, not onely 
fortunate, but also most sufficient vertuous and worthy of Empire. An other 
is for iust &amp; honourable victory atchieued against the forreine enemy. 
A third at solemne feasts and pompes of coronations and enstallments of 
honourable orders. An other for iollity at weddings and marriages. An other 
at the births of Princes children. An other for priuate entertainements in 
Court, or other secret disports in chamber, and such solitary places. And as 
these reioysings tend to diuers effects, so do they also carry diuerse formes 
and nominations: for those of victorie and peace are called 
<hi>Triumphall</hi>, whereof we our selues haue heretofore giuen some 
example by our <hi>Triumphals</hi> written in honour of her Maiesties long 
peace. And they were vsed by the auncients in like manner, as we do our 
generall processions or Letanies with bankets and bonefires and all manner 
of ioyes. Those that were to honour the persons of great Princes or to 
solemnise the pompes of any installment were called <hi>Encomia</hi>, we 
may call them carols of honour. Those to celebrate marriages were called 
songs nuptiall or <hi>Epithalamies</hi>, but in a certaine misticall sense as 
shall be said hereafter. Others for magnificence at the natiuities of Princes 
children, or by custome vsed yearely vpon the same dayes, are called songs 
natall or <hi>Genethliaca</hi>. Others for secret recreation and pastime in 
chambers with company or alone were the ordinary Musickes amorous, such 
as might be song with voice or to the Lute, Citheron or Harpe, or daunced by 
measures as the Italian Pauan and galliard are at these daies in Princes 
Courts and other places of honourable or ciuill assembly, and of all these we

               <head>The forme of Poeticall lamentations.</head>
               <p>Lamenting is altogether contrary to reioising, euery man saith so, and yet is 
it a peece of ioy to be able to lament with ease, <pb n="38"/>
and freely to poure forth a mans inward sorrowes and the greefs wherewith 
his minde is surcharged. This was a very necessary deuise of the Poet and a 
fine, besides his poetrie to play also the Phisitian, and not onely by applying 
a medicine to the ordinary sicknes of mankind, but by making the very greef 
it selfe (in part) cure of the disease. Nowe are the causes of mans sorrowes 
many: the death of his parents, friends, allies, and children: (though many 
of the barbarous nations do reioyce at their burials and sorrow at their 
birthes) the ouerthrowes and discomforts in battell, the subuersions of 
townes and cities, the desolations of countreis, the losse of goods and 
worldly promotions, honour and good renowne: finally the trauails and 
torments of loue forlorne or ill bestowed, either by disgrace, deniall, delay, 
and twenty other wayes, that well experienced louers could recite. Such of 
these greefs as might be refrained or holpen by wisedome, and the parties 
owne good endeuour, the Poet gaue none order to sorrow them: for first as 
to the good renowne it is lost, for the more part by some default of the 
owner, and may be by his well doings recouered againe. And if it be vniustly 
taken away, as by vntrue and famous libels, the offenders recantation may 
suffise for his amends: so did the Poet <hi>Stesichorus</hi>, as it is written 
of him in his <hi>Pallinodie</hi> vpon the disprayse of <hi>Helena</hi>, and 
recouered his eye sight. Also for worldly goods they come and go, as things 
not long proprietary to any body, and are not yet subiect vnto fortunes 
dominion so, but that we our selues are in great part accessarie to our own 
losses and hinderaunces, by ouersight &amp; misguiding of our selues and our 
things, therefore why should we bewaile our such voluntary detriment? But 
death the irrecouerable losse, death the dolefull departure of frendes, that 
can neuer be recontinued by any other meeting or new acquaintance. Besides 
our vncertaintie and suspition of their estates and welfare in the places of 
their new abode, seemeth to carry a reasonable pretext of iust sorrow. 
Likewise the great ouerthrowes in battell and desolations of countreys by 
warres, aswell for the losse of many liues and much libertie as for that it 
toucheth the whole state, and euery priuate man hath his portion in the 
damage: Finally for loue, there is no frailtie in flesh and bloud so excusable 
as it, no comfort or discomfort greater <pb n="39"/>
then the good and bad successe thereof, nothing more naturall to man, 
nothing of more force to vanquish his will and to inuegle his iudgement. 
Therefore of death and burials, of th'aduersities by warres, and of true loue 
lost of ill bestowed, are th'onely sorrowes that the noble Poets sought by 
their arte to remoue or appease, not with any medicament of a contrary 
temper, as the <hi>Galenistes</hi> vse to cure [<hi>contraria contrariis</hi>] but 
as the <hi>Paracelsians</hi>, who cure [<hi>similia similibus</hi>] making one 
dolour to expell another, and in this case, one short sorrowing the remedie 
of a long and grieuous sorrow. And the lamenting of deathes was chiefly at 
the very burialls of the dead, also at monethes mindes and longer times, by 
custome continued yearely, when as they vsed many offices of seruice and 
loue towardes the dead, and thereupon are called <hi>Obsequies</hi> in our 
vulgare, which was done not onely by cladding the mourners their friendes 
and seruantes in blacke vestures, of shape dolefull and sad, but also by 
wofull countenaunces and voyces, and besides by Poeticall mournings in 
verse. Such funerall songs were called <hi>Epicedia</hi> if they were song by 
many, and <hi>Monodia</hi> if they were vttered by one alone, and this was 
vsed at the enterment of Princes and others of great accompt, and it was 
reckoned a great ciuilitie to vse such ceremonies, as at this day is also in 
some countrey vsed. In Rome they accustomed to make orations funerall and 
commendatorie of the dead parties in the publique place called 
<hi>Prorostris</hi>: and our <hi>Theologians</hi>, in stead thereof vse to make 
sermons, both teaching the people some good learning, and also saying well 
of the departed. Those songs of the dolorous discomfits in battaile, and 
other desolations in warre, or of townes saccaged and subuerted, were long 
by the remnant of the army ouerthrowen, with great skrikings and outcries, 
holding the wrong end of their weapon vpwards in signe of sorrow and 
dispaire. The cities also made generall mournings &amp; offred sacrifices 
with Poeticall songs to appease the wrath of the martiall gods &amp; 
goddesses. The third sorrowing was of loues, by long lamentation in 
<hi>Elegie</hi>: so was their song called, and it was in a pitious maner of 
meetre, placing a limping <hi>Pentameter</hi>, after a lusty <hi>Exameter</hi>, 
which made it go dolourously more then any other meeter.

               <p>To returne from sorrow to reioysing it is a very good hap and no vnwise part 
for him that can do it, I say therefore, that the comfort of issue and 
procreation of children is so naturall and so great, not onely to all men but 
specially to Princes, as duetie and ciuilitie haue made it a common custome 
to reioyse at the birth of their noble children, and to keepe those dayes 
hallowed and festiuall for euer once in the yeare, during the parentes or 
childrens liues: and that by publique order &amp; consent. Of which 
reioysings and mirthes the Poet ministred the first occasion honorable, by 
presenting of ioyfull songs and ballades, praysing the parentes by proofe, 
the child by hope, the whole kinred by report, &amp; the day it selfe with 
wishes of all good successe, long life, health &amp; prosperitie for euer to 
the new borne. These poems were called in Greeke <hi>Genethaca</hi>, with vs 
they may be called natall or birth songs.

               <head>The maner of reioysings at mariages and weddings.</head>
               <p>As the consolation of children well begotten is great, no lesse but rather 
greater ought to be that which is occasion of children, that is honorable 
matrimonie, a loue by al lawes allowed, not mutable nor encombred with 
such vaine cares &amp; passions, as that other loue, whereof there is no 
assurance, but loose and fickle affection occasioned for the most part by 
sodaine sights and acquaintance of no long triall or experience, nor vpon any 
other good ground wherein any suretie may be conceiued: wherefore the 
Ciuill Poet could do no lesse in conscience and credit, then as he had before 
done to the ballade of birth: now with much better deuotion to celebrate by 
his poeme the chearefull day of mariages aswell Princely as others, for that 
hath alwayes bene accompted with euery countrey and nation of neuer so 
barbarous people, the highest &amp; holiest, of any ceremonie apperteining 
to man: a match forsooth made for euer and not for a day, a solace prouided 
for youth, a comfort for age, a knot of alliance &amp; amitie indissoluble: 
great reioysing was therefore due to such a matter and to so gladsome <pb n="41"/>
a time. This was done in ballade wise as the natall song, and was song 
very sweetely by Musitians at the chamber dore of the Bridegroome and 
Bride at such times as shalbe hereafter declared and they were called 
<hi>Epithalamies</hi> as much to say as ballades at the bedding of the bride: 
for such as were song at the borde at dinner or supper were other Musickes 
and not properly <hi>Epithalamies</hi>. Here, if I shall say that which 
apperteineth to th'arte, and disclose the misterie of the whole matter, I 
must and doe with all humble reuerence bespeake pardon of the chaste and 
honorable eares, least I should either offend them with licentious speach, or 
leaue them ignorant of the ancient guise in old times vsed at weddings (in 
my simple opinion) nothing reproueable. This <hi>Epithalamie</hi> was 
deuided by breaches into three partes to serue for three seuerall fits or 
times to be song. The first breach was song at the first parte of the night 
when the spouse and her husband were brought to their bed &amp; at the very 
chamber dore, where in a large vtter roome vsed to be (besides the 
musitiens) good store of ladies or gentlewomen of their kinsefolkes, &amp; 
others who came to honor the mariage, &amp; the tunes of the songs were 
very loude and shrill, to the intent there might no noise be hard out of the 
bed chamber by the skreeking &amp; outcry of the young damosell feeling the 
first forces of her stiffe &amp; rigorous young man, she being as all virgins 
tender &amp; weake, &amp; vnexpert in those maner of affaires. For which 
purpose also they vsed by old nurses (appointed to that seruice) to 
suppresse the noise by casting of pottes full of nuttes round about the 
chamber vpon the hard floore or pauement, for they vsed not mattes nor 
rushes as we doe now. So as the Ladies and gentlewomen should haue their 
eares so occupied what with Musicke, and what with their handes wantonly 
scambling and catching after the nuttes, that they could not intend to harken 
after any other thing. This was as I said to diminish the noise of the 
laughing lamenting spouse. The tenour of that part of the song was to 
congratulate the first acquaintance and meeting of the young couple, 
allowing of their parents good discretions in making the match, then 
afterward to sound cherfully to the onset and first encounters of that 
amorous battaile, to declare the consort of children, &amp; encrease of loue 
by that meane chiefly caused: the bride shewing her self euery waies well 
disposed and still <pb n="42"/>
supplying occasions of new lustes and loue to her husband, by her obedience 
and amorous embracings and all other allurementes. About midnight or one 
of the clocke, the Musicians came again to the chamber dore (all the Ladies 
and other women as they were of degree, hauing taken their leaue, and being 
gone to their rest.) This part of the ballade was to refresh the faint and 
weried bodies and spirits, and to animate new appetites with cherefull 
wordes, encoraging them to the recontinuance of the same entertainments, 
praising and commending (by supposall) the good conformities of them both, 
&amp; their desire one to vanquish the other by such frendly conflictes: 
alledging that the first embracements neuer bred barnes, by reason of their 
ouermuch affection and heate, but onely made passage for children and 
enforced greater liking to the late made match. That the second assaultes, 
were less rigorous, but more vigorous and apt to auance the purpose of 
procreation, that therefore they should persist in all good appetite with an 
inuincible courage to the end. This was the second part of the 
<hi>Epithalamie</hi>. In the morning when it was faire broad day, &amp; that 
by liklyhood all tournes were sufficiently serued, the last actes of the 
enterlude being ended, &amp; that the bride must within few hours arise and 
apparrell her selfe, no more as a virgine, but as a wife, and about dinner 
time must by order come forth <hi>Sicut sponsa de thalanio</hi>, very 
demurely and stately to be sene and acknowledged of her parents and 
kinsfolkes whether she were the same woman or a changeling, or dead or 
aliue, or maimed by any accident nocturnall. The same Musicians came 
againe with this last part, and greeted them both with a Psalme of new 
applausions, for that they had either of them so well behaued them selues 
that night, the husband to rob his spouse of her maidenhead and saue her 
life, the bride so lustely to satisfie her husbandes loue and scape with so 
litle daunger of her person, for which good chaunce that they should make a 
louely truce and abstinence of that warre till next night sealing the placard 
of that louely league, with twentie maner of sweet kisses, then by good 
admonitions enformed them to the frugall &amp; thriftie life all the rest of 
their dayes. The good man getting and bringing home, the wife sauing that 
which her husband should get, therewith to be the better able to keepe good <pb n="43"/>
hospitalitie, according to their estates, and to bring vp their children (if 
God sent any) vertuously, and the better by their owne good example. Finally 
to perseuer all the rest of their life in true and inuiolable wedlocke. This 
ceremony was omitted when men maried widowes or such as had tasted the 
frutes of loue before (we call them well experienced young women) in whom 
there was no feare of daunger to their persons, or of any outcry at all, at the 
time of those terrible approches. Thus much touching the vsage of 
<hi>Epithalamie</hi> or bedding ballad of the ancient times, in which if there 
were any wanton or lasciuious matter more then ordinarie which they called 
<hi>Ficenina lucentia</hi> it was borne withal for that time because of the 
matter no lesse requiring. <hi>Catullus</hi> hath made of them one or two 
very artificiall and ciuil: but none more excellent then of late yeares a 
young noble man of Germanie as I take it <hi>Iohannes secundus</hi> who in 
that and in his poeme <hi>De bassus</hi>, passeth any of the auncient or 
moderne Poetes in my iudgment.

therefore the poet deuised a prety fashioned poeme short and sweete (as we 
are wont to say) and called it <hi>Epigramma</hi> in which euery mery 
conceited man might without any long studie or tedious ambage, make his 
frend sport, and anger his foe, and giue a prettie nip, or shew a sharpe 
conceit in few verses: for this <hi>Epigramme</hi> is but an inscription or 
writing made as it were vpon a table, or in a windowe, or vpon the wall or

scrible with ynke with chalke, or with a cole such matters as they would

put in paper and in bookes, and vsed as ordinarie missiues, some of 
frendship, some <pb n="44"/>
of defiaunce, or as other messages of mirth: <hi>Martiall</hi> was the chiefe 
of this skil among the Latines, &amp; at these days the best Epigrammes we 
fine, &amp; of the sharpest conceit are those that haue bene gathered among 
the reliques of the two muet <hi>Satyres</hi> in Rome, <hi>Pasquill</hi> and 
<hi>Marphorius</hi>, which in time of <hi>Sede vacante</hi>, when merry 
conceited men lifted to gibe &amp; iest at the dead Pope, or any of his 
Cardinales, they fastened them vpon those Images which now lie in the 
open streets, and were tollerated, but after that terme expired they were 
inhibited againe. These inscriptions or Epigrammes at their beginning had 
no certaine author that would auouch them, some for feare of blame, if they 
were ouer saucy or sharpe, others for modestie of the writer as was that 
<hi>disticke</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> which he set vpon the pallace gate of the 
emperour <hi>Augustus</hi>, which I will recite for the breifnes and quicknes

</p>
               <p>These two verse were very well liked, and brought to th'Emperours Maiestie, 
who tooke great pleasure in them, &amp; willed the author should be knowen. 
A sausie courtier profered him selfe to be the man, and had a good reward 
giuen him: for the Emperour him self was not only learned, but of much 
munificence toward all learned men: whereupon <hi>Virgill</hi> seing him 
self by his ouermuch modestie defrauded of the reward, that an impudent 
had gotten by abuse of his merit, came the next night, and fastened vpon the 
same place this halfe metre, four times iterated. Thus.

               <p>And there it remained a great while because no man wist what <pb n="45"/>
it meant, till <hi>Virgill</hi> opened the whole fraude by this deuise. He 
wrote aboue the same halfe metres this whole verse <hi>Exameter</hi>.

               </p>
               <p>And put to his name <hi>Publius Virgilius Maro</hi>. This matter came by and 
by to Th'emperours eare, who taking great pleasure in the deuise called for 
<hi>Virgill</hi>, and gaue him not onely a present reward, with a good 
allowance of dyet a bonche in court as we vse to call it: but also held him 
for euer after vpon larger triall he had made of his learning and vertue in so 
great reputation, as he vouchsafed to giue him the name of a frend 
(<hi>amicus</hi>) which among the Romanes was so great an honour and 
speciall fauour, as all such persons were allowed to the Emperours table, or 
to the Senatours who had receiued them (as frendes) and they were the only

               <head>Of the poeme called Epitaph used for memoriall of the dead.</head>
               <p>An Epitaph is but a kind of Epigram only applied to the report of the dead 
persons estate and degree, or of his other good or bad partes, to his 
commendation or reproch: and is an inscription such as a man may 
commodiously write or engraue vpon a tombe in few verses, pithie, quicke 
and sententious for the passer by to peruse, and iudge vpon without any long 
tariaunce: So as if it exceed the measure of an Epigram, it is then (if the 
verse be correspondent) rather an Elegie then an Epitaph which errour many 
of these bastard rimers commit, because they be not learned, nor (as we are 
wont to say) their catstes masters, for they make long and tedious 
discourses, and write them in large tables to be hanged vp in Churches and 
chauncells ouer the tombes of great men and others, which be so exceeding 
long as one must haue halfe <pb n="46"/>
a dayes leasure to reade one of them, &amp; must be called away before he 
come halfe to the end, or else be locked into the Church by the Sexten as I 
my selfe was once serued reading an Epitaph in a certain cathedrall Church 
of England. They be ignorant of poesie that call such long tales by the name 
of Epitaphes, they might better call them Elegies, as I said before, ad then 
ought neither to be engrauen nor hanged vp in tables. I haue seene them 
neuertheles vpon many honorable tombes of these late times erected, which

truly affirme to haue bene the first deuisers thereof our selues, as

so much beautified our English tong (as at this day it will be found our 
nation is in nothing inferiour to the French or Italian for copie of language, 
subtiltie of deuice, good method and proportion in any forme of poeme, but 
that they may compare with the most, and perchance passe a great many of 
them. And I will not reach aboue the time of king <hi>Edward</hi> the third,

before their times by reason of the late Normane conquest, which had 
brought into this Realme much alteration both of our langage and lawes, and

Plowman, next him followed <hi>Harding</hi> the Chronicler, then in king 
<hi>Henry</hi> th'eight times <hi>Skelton</hi>, (I wot not for what great 
worthines) surnamed the Poet <hi>Laureat</hi>. In the latter end of the same 
kings raigne sprong vp a new company of courtly makers, of whom Sir 
<hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> at th'elder &amp; <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of Surrey were the 
two chieftaines, who hauing trauailed into Italie, and there tasted the 
sweete and stately measures and stile of the Italian Poesie as nouices 
newly crept out of the schooles of <hi>Dante Arioste</hi> and <hi>Petrarch</hi>, 
they greatly pollished our rude &amp; homely maner of vulgar Poesie, from 
that it had bene before, and for that cause may iustly be sayd the first 
reformers of our English <pb n="49"/>
meetre and stile. In the same time or not long after was the Lord 
<hi>Nicholas Vaux</hi>, a man of much facilitie in vulgar makings. Afterward 
in king <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths time came to be in reputation for the same 
facultie <hi>Thomas Sternehold</hi>, who first translated into English 
certaine Psalmes of Dauid, and <hi>Iohn Heywood</hi> the Epigrammatist who 
for the myrth and quicknesse of his conceits more then for any good learning 
was in him came to be well benefited by the king. But the principall man in 
this profession at the same time was Maister <hi>Edward Ferrys</hi> a man of 
no lesse mirth &amp; felicitie that way, but of much more skil, &amp; 
magnificence in this meeter, and therefore wrate for the most part to the 
stage, in Tragedie and sometimes in Comedie or Enterlude, wherein he gaue 
the king so much good recreation, as he had thereby many good rewardes. In 
Queenes <hi>Maries</hi> time florished aboue any other Doctour <hi>Phaer</hi>
one that was well learned &amp; excellently well translated into English 
verse Heroicall certaine bookes of <hi>Virgils Aeneidos</hi>. since him 
followed Maister <hi>Arthure Golding</hi>, who with no lesse commendation 
turned into English meetre the Metamorphosis of <hi>Ouide</hi>, and that other 
Doctour, who made the supplement to those bookes of <hi>Virgiles 
Aeneidos</hi>, which Maister <hi>Phaer</hi> left vndone. And in her Maiesties 
time that now is are sprong vp an other crew of Courtly makers Noble men 
and Gentlemen of her Maiesties owne seruantes, who haue written 
excellently well as it would appeare if their doings could be found out and 
made publicke with the rest, of which number is first that noble Gentleman 
<hi>Edward</hi> Earle of Oxford. <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord of Bukhurst, when he was 
young, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord Paget, Sir <hi>Philip Sydney</hi>, Sir <hi>Walter 
Rawleigh</hi>, Master <hi>Edward Dyar</hi> Maister <hi>Fulke Greuell, Gascon, 
Britton, Turberuille</hi> and a great many other learned Gentlemen, whose 
names I do not omit for enuie, but to auoyde tediousnesse, and who haue 
deserued no little commendation. But of them all particularly this is myne 
opinion, that <hi>Chaucer</hi>, with <hi>Gower, Lidgat</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi>
for their antiquitie ought to haue the first place, and <hi>Chaucer</hi> as the 
most renowmed of them all, for the much learning appeareth to be in him 
aboue any of the rest. And though many of his bookes be but bare 
translations out of the Latin &amp; French, yet are they wel handled, as his 
bookes of <hi>Troilus</hi>
                  <pb n="50"/>
                  <hi>Cresseid</hi>, and the Romant of the Rose, whereof he translated but one 
halfe, the deuice was <hi>Iohn de Mahunes</hi> a French Poet, the Canterbury 
tales were <hi>Chaucers</hi> owne inuention as I suppose, and where he 
sheweth more the naturall of his pleasant wit, then in any other of his 
workes, his similitudes comparisons and all other descriptions are such as 
can not be amended. His meetre Heroicall of <hi>Troilus</hi> and 
<hi>Cresseid</hi> is very graue and stately, keeping the staffe of seuen, and 
the verse of ten, his other verses of the Canterbury tales be but riding ryme, 
neuerthelesse very well becomming the matter of that pleasaunt pilgrimage 
in which euery mans part is playd with much decency. <hi>Gower</hi> sauing 
for his good and graue moralities, had nothing in him highly to be 
commended, for his verse was homely and without good measure, his wordes 
strained much deale out of the French writers, his ryme wrested, and in his 
inuentions small subtilitie: the applications of his moralities are the best 
in him, and yet those many times very grossely bestowed, neither doth the 
substance of his workes sufficiently aunswere the subtiltie of his titles. 
<hi>Lydgat</hi> a translatour onely and no deuiser of that which he wrate, but 
one that wrate in good verse. <hi>Harding</hi> a Poet Epick or Historicall, 
handled himselfe well according to the time and maner of his subiect He 
that wrote the Satyr of Piers Ploughman, seemed to haue bene a malcontent 
of that time, and therefore bent himselfe wholy to taxe the disorders of 
that age, and specially the pride of the Romane Clergy, of whose fall he 
seemeth to be a very true Prophet, his verse is but loose meetre, and his 
termes hard and obscure, so as in them is litle pleasure to be taken. 
<hi>Skelton</hi> a sharpe Satirist, but with more rayling and scoffery then 
became a Poet Lawreat, such among the Greekes were called 
<hi>Pantomimi</hi>, with vs Buffons, altogether applying their wits to 
Scurrillities &amp; other ridiculous matters. <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of Surrey 
and Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi>, betweene whom I finde very litle difference, I 
repute them (as before) for the two chief lanternes of light to all others 
that haue since employed their pennes vpon English Poesie, their conceits 
were loftie, their stiles stately, their conueyance cleanely, their termes 
proper, their meetre sweete and well proportioned, in all imitating very 
naturally and studiously their Maister <hi>Francis Petrarcha</hi>. <pb n="51"/>
The Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> his commendation lyeth chiefly in the facillitie of his 
meetre, and the aptnesse of his descriptions such as he taketh vpon him to 
make, namely in sundry of his Songs, wherein he sheweth the counterfaie 
action very liuely &amp; pleasantly. Of the later sort I thinke thus. That for 
Tragedie, the Lord of Burckhurst, &amp; Maister <hi>Edward Ferrys</hi> for 
such doings as I haue sene of their do deserue the hyest price: Th'Earle of 
Oxford and Maister <hi>Edwardes</hi> of her Maiesties Chappell for comedy 
and Enterlude. For Eglogue and pastorall Poesie, Sir <hi>Philip Sydney</hi> and 
Maister <hi>Challenner</hi>, and that other Gentleman who wrate the late 
shepheardes Callender. For dittie and amorous <hi>Ode</hi> I finde Sir 
<hi>Walter Rawleyghs</hi> vayne most loftie, insolent, and passionate. 
Maister <hi>Edward Dyar</hi>, for Elegie most sweete, solempne and of high 
conceit. <hi>Gascon</hi> for a good meeter and for a plentifull vayne. 
<hi>Phaer</hi> and <hi>Golding</hi> for a learned and well corrected verse, 
specially in translation cleare and very faithfuly answering their authors 
intent. Others haue also written with much facillitie, but more 
commendably perchance if they had not written so much nor so popularly. 
But last in recitall and first in degree is the Queene our soueraigne Lady, 
whose learned, delicate, noble Muse, easily surmounteth all the rest that 
haue written before her time or since, for sence, sweetnesse and subtillitie, 
be it in Ode, Elegie, Epigram, or any other kinde of poeme Heroick or Lyricke, 
wherein it shall please her Maiestie to employ her penne, euen by as much 
oddes as her owne excellent estate and degree exceedeth all the rest of her 
most humble vassalls.

            <div xml:id="c2.1" type="chapter">
               <head>Of Proportion Poeticall.</head>
               <p>It is said by such as professe the Mathematicall sciences, that all things 
stand by proportion, and that without it nothing could stand to be good or 
beautiful. The Doctors of our Theologie to the same effect, but in other 
termes, say: that God made the world by number, measure and weight: some 
for weight say tune, and peraduenture better. For weight is a kind of 
measure or of much conueniencie with it: and therefore in their 
descriptions be alwayes coupled together (<hi>statica &amp; metrica</hi>) 
weight and measures. Hereupon it seemeth the Philosopher gathers a triple 
proportion, to with, the Arithmeticall, the Geometricall, and the Musicall. 
And by one of these three is euery other proportion guided of the things that 
haue conueniencie by relation, as the visible by light colour and shadow: the 
audible by stirres, times and accents: the odorable by smelles of sundry 
temperaments: the tastible by fauours to the rate: the tangible by his 
obiectes in this or that regard. Of all which we leaue to speake, returning 
to our poeticall proportion, which holdeth of the Musical, because as we sayd 
before Poesie is a skill to speake &amp; write harmonically: and verses or 
rime be a kind of Musicall vtterance, by reason of a certaine congruitie in 
sounds pleasing the eare, though not perchance so exquisitely as the 
harmonicall concents of the artificial Musicke consisting in strained tunes, 
as is the vocall Musike, or that of melodious instruments, as Lutes, Harpes, 
Regals, Records and such like. And this our proportion Poeticall <pb n="54"/>
resteth in fiue points: Staffe, Measure, Concord, Scituation and figure all 
which shall be spoken of in their places. 

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="c2.2" type="chapter">
               <head>Of proportion in Staffe.</head>
               <p>Staffe in our vulgare Poesie I know not why it should be so called, vnlesse it 
be for that we vnderstand it for a bearer or supporter of a song or ballad not 
vnlike the old weake bodie, that is stayed vp by his staffe, and were not 
otherwise able to walke or to stand vpright. The Italian called it 
<hi>Stanza</hi>, as if we should say a resting place: and if we consider well 
the forme of this Poeticall staffe, we shall finde it to be a certaine number 
of verses allowed to go altogether and ioyne without any intermission, and 
doe or should finish vp all the sentences of the same with a full period 
vnlesse it be in som special cases, &amp; there to stay till another staffe 
follow of like sort: and the shortest staffe conteineth not vnder foure 
verses, nor the longest aboue ten, if it passe that number it is rather a 
whole ditty then properly a staffe. Also for the more part the staues stand 
rather vpon the euen nomber of verses then the odde, though there be of both 
sorts. The first proportion then of a staffe is by <hi>quadrien</hi> or foure 
verses. The second of fiue verses, and is seldome vsed. The third by 
<hi>sizeme</hi> or sixe verses, and is not only most vsual, but also very 
pleasant to th'eare. The fourth is in seuen verses, &amp; is the chiefe of our 
ancient proportions vsed by any rimer writing any thing of historical or 
graue poeme, as ye may see in <hi>Chaucer</hi> and <hi>Lidgate</hi> th'one 
writing the loues of <hi>Troylus</hi> and <hi>Cresseida</hi>, th'other of the fall 
of Princes: both by them translated not deuised. The first proportion is of 
eight verses very stately and <hi>Heroicke</hi>, and which I like better then 
that of seuen, because it receaueth better band. The sixt is of nine verses, 
rare but very graue. The seuenth proportion is of tenne verses, very stately, 
but in many mens opinion too long: neuerthelesse of very good grace &amp; 
much grauitie. Of eleuen and twelue I find none ordinary staues vsed in any 
vulgar language, neither doth it serue well to continue any historicall report 
or ballade, or other song: but is a dittie of it self, and no staffe, yet some 
moderne writers haue vsed it but very seldome. Then last of all haue ye a 
proportion to be vsed in the number <pb n="55"/>
of your staues, as to caroll and a ballade, to a song, &amp; a round, or 
virelay. For to an historicall poeme no certain number is limited, but as the 
matter fals out: also a <hi>distick</hi> or couple of verses is not to be 
accompted a staffe, but serues for a continuance as we see in Elegie, 
Epitaph, Epigramme or such meetres, of plaine concord not harmonically 
entertangled, as some other songs of more delicate musick be. 


</p>
               <p>A staffe of foure verses containeth in it selfe matter sufficient to make a 
full periode or complement of sence, though it doe not alwayes so, and 
therefore may go by diuisions. 


</p>
               <p>A staffe of fiue verses, is not much vsed because he that cannot comprehend 
his periode in foure verses, will rather driue it into six then leaue it in fiue, 
for that the euen number is more agreable to the eare then the odde is. 


</p>
               <p>A staffe of sixe verses, is very pleasant to the eare, and also serueth for a 
greater complement then the inferiour staues, which maketh him more 
commonly to be vsed. 


</p>
               <p>A staffe of seuen verses, most vsuall with our auncient makers, also the 
staffe of eight, nine and ten of larger complement then the rest, are onely 
vsed by the later makers, &amp; unlesse they go with very good bande, do not 
so well as the inferiour staues. Therefore if ye make your staffe of eight, 
by two fowers not entertangled, it is not a huitaine or a staffe of eight, but 
two quadreins, so is it in ten verses, not being entertangled they be but two 
staues of fiue.

            <div xml:id="c2.3" type="chapter">
               <head>Of proportion in measure.</head>
               <p>Meeter and measure is all one, for what the Greeks call 
<foreign xml:lang="el">metron</foreign>, the Latines call <hi>Mensura</hi>, and 
is but the quantitie of a verse, either long or short. This quantitie with 
them consisteth in the number of their feete: &amp; with vs in the number of 
sillables, which are comprehended in euery verse, not regarding his feete, 
otherwise then that we allow in scanning our verse, two sillables to make 
one short portion (suppose it a foote) in euery verse. And after that sort ye 
may say, we haue feete in our vulgare rymes, but that is improperly: for a 
foote by his sence naturall is a member of office and function, and serueth 
to three purposes, that is to say, to go, to <pb n="56"/>
runne, &amp; to stand still: so as he must be sometimes swift, sometimes 
slow, sometime vnegally marching or peraduenture steddy. And if our feete 
Poeticall want these qualities it can not be sayd a foote in sence 
translatiue as here. And this commeth to passe, by reason of the euident 
motion and stirre, which is perceiued in the sounding of our wordes not 
alwayes egall: for some aske longer, some shorter time to be vttered in, 
&amp; so by the Philosophers definition, stirre is the true measure of time. 
The Greekes &amp; Latines because their wordes hapned to be of many 
sillables, and very few of one sillable, it fell out right with them to 
conceiue and also to perceiue, a notable diuersitie of motion and times in 
the pronuntiation of their wordes, and therefore to euery <hi>bisillable</hi>
they allowed two times, &amp; to a <hi>trisillable</hi> three times, &amp; to 
euery <hi>polisillable</hi> more, according to his quantitie, &amp; their times 
were some long, some short according as their motions were slow or swift. 
For the sound of some sillable stayd the eare a great while, and others slid 
away so quickly, as if they had not bene pronounced, then euery sillable 
being allowed one time, either short or long, it fell out that euery 
<hi>tetrasillable</hi> had foure times, euery <hi>trisillable</hi> three, and the 
<hi>bisillable</hi> two, by which obseruation euery word, not vnder that sise, 
as he ranne or stood in a verse, was called by them a foote of such and so 
many times, namely the <hi>bisillable</hi> was either of two long times as 
the <hi>spondeus</hi>, or two short, as the <hi>pirchius</hi>, or of a long &amp; a 
short as the <hi>trocheus</hi>, or of a short and a long as the <hi>iambus</hi>: 
the like rule did they set vpon the word <hi>trisillable</hi>, calling him a 
foote of three times: as the <hi>dactilus</hi> of a long and two short: the 
<hi>mollossus</hi> of three long, the <hi>tribracchus</hi> of three short, the 
<hi>amphibracchus</hi> of two long and a short, the <hi>amphimacer</hi> of two 
short and a long. The word of foure sillables they called a foote of foure 
times, some or all of them, either long or short: and yet not so content they 
mounted higher, and because their wordes serued well thereto, they made 
feete of sixe times: but this proceeded more of curiositie, then otherwise: 
for whatsoeuer foote passe the <hi>trisillable</hi> is compounded of his 
inferiour as euery number Arithmeticall aboue three, is compounded of the 
inferiour numbers as twise two make foure, but the three is made of one 
number, videl. of two and an vnitie. Now because our naturall &amp; 
primitiue language of the <hi>Saxon English</hi>, <pb n="57"/>
beares not any wordes (at least very few) of moe sillables then one 
(for whatsoeuer we see exceede, commeth to vs by the alterations of our 
language growen vpon many conquestes and otherwise) there could be no 
such obseruation of times in the found of our wordes, &amp; for that cause 
we could not haue the feete which the Greeks and Latines haue in their 
meetres: but of this stirre &amp; motion of their deuised feete, nothing can 
better shew the qualitie then these runners at common games, who setting 
forth from the first goale, one giueth the start speedely &amp; perhaps 
before the come half way to th'other goale, decayeth his pace, as a man 
weary &amp; fainting: another is slow at the start, but by amending his 
pace keepes euen with his fellow or perchance gets before him: another one 
while gets ground, another while loseth it again, either in the beginning, or 
middle of his race, and so proceedes vnegally sometimes swift somtimes 
slow as his breath or forces serue him: another sort there be that plod on, 
&amp; will neuer change their pace, whether they win or lose the game: in 
this maner doth the Greeke <hi>dactilus</hi> begin slowly and keepe on 
swifter till th'end, for his race being deuided into three parts, he spends 
one, &amp; that is the first slowly, the other twaine swiftly: the 
<hi>anapestus</hi> his first two parts swiftly, his last slowly: the 
<hi>Molossus</hi> spends all three parts of his race slowly and egally 
<hi>Bacchius</hi> his first part swiftly, &amp; two last parts slowly. The 
<hi>tribrachus</hi> all his three parts swiftly: the <hi>antibacchius</hi> his 
two first partes slowly, his last &amp; third swiftly: the 
<hi>amphimacer</hi>, his first &amp; last part slowly &amp; his middle part 
swiftly: the <hi>amphibracus</hi> his first and last parts swiftly but his 
midle part slowly, &amp; so of others by like proportion. This was a pretie 
phantasticall obseruation of them, &amp; yet brought their meetres to haue 
a maruelous good grace, which was in Greeke called 
<foreign xml:lang="el">rihmos</foreign>: whence we haue deriued this word 
ryme, but improperly &amp; not wel because we haue no such feete or times 
or stirres in our meeters, by whose <hi>simpathie</hi>, or pleasant 
conueniencie with th'eare, we could take any delight: this <hi>rithmus</hi> of 
theirs, is not therfore our rime, but a certaine musicall numerositie in 
vtterance, and not a bare number as that of the Arithmeticall computation 
is, which therefore is not called <hi>rithmus</hi> but <hi>arithmus</hi>. Take 
this away from them, I meane the running of their feete, there is nothing of 
curiositie among them more then with vs nor yet so much.

               <head>How many sorts of measures we use in our vulgar.</head>
               <p>To returne from time to our measure againe, it hath bene sayd that 
according to the number of the sillables contained in euery verse, the same 
is sayd a long or short meeter, and his shortest proportion is of foure 
sillables, and his longest of twelue, they that vse it aboue, passe the bounds 
of good proportion. And euery meeter may be aswel in the odde as in the 
euen sillable, but better in the euen, and one verse may begin in the euen, 
&amp; another follow in the odde, and so keepe a commendable proportion. 
The verse that containeth but two silables, which may be in one word, is not 
vsuall: therefore many do deny him to be a verse, saying that it is but a 
foot, and that a meeter can haue no lesse then two feete at the least, but I 
find it otherwise aswell among the best Italian Poets, as also with our 
vulgar makers, and that two sillables serue wel for a short measure in the 
first place, and midle, and end of a staffe: and also in diuerse scituations 
and by sundry distances, and is very passionate and of good grace, as shalbe 
declared more at large in the Chapter of proportion by scituation.

fauour in a meetre of three sillables nor in effect in any odde, but they may 
be vsed for varietie sake, and specially being enterlaced with others: the

               <p>Now there can not be in a maker a fowler fault, then to falsifie his accent to 
serue his cadence, or by vntrue orthographie to wrench his words to helpe 
his rime, for it is a signe that such a maker is not copious in his owne 
language, or (as they are wont to say) not halfe his crafts maister: as for 
example, if one should rime to this word [<hi>Restore</hi>] he may not match 
him with [<hi>Doore</hi>] or [<hi>Poore</hi>] for neither of both are of like 
terminant, either by good orthography or in naturall sound, therfore such 
rime is strained, so is it to this word [<hi>Ram</hi>] to say [<hi>came</hi>] or to 
[<hi>Beane</hi>] [<hi>Den</hi>] for the sound not nor be written alike, &amp; many 
other like cadences which were superfluous to recite, and are vsuall with 
rude rimers who obserue not precisely the rules of [<hi>prosidie</hi>] 
neuerthelesse in all such cases (if necessitie constrained) it is somewhat 
more tollerable to help the rime by false orthographie, then to leaue an 
vnpleasant dissonance to the eare, by keeping trewe orthographie and 
loosing the rime, as for example it is better to rime [<hi>Dore</hi>] with 
[<hi>Restore</hi>] then his truer orthographie, which is [<hi>Doore</hi>] and to 
this word [<hi>Desire</hi>] to say [<hi>Fier</hi>] then fyre though it be otherwise 
better written <hi>fire</hi>. For since the cheife grace of our vulgar Poesie 
consisteth in the Symphonie, as hath bene already sayd, our maker must not 
be too licentious in his concords, but see that they go euen, iust and 
melodious in the eare, and right so in the numerositie or currantnesse of the 
whole body of his verse, and in euery other of his proportions. For a 
licentious maker is in truth but a bungler and not a Poet. Such men were in 
effect the most part of all your old rimers and specially <hi>Gower</hi>, who 
to make vp his rime would for the most part write his terminant sillable 
with false orthographie, and many times not sticke to put in a plane French 
word for an English, &amp; so by your leaue do many of our common rimers 
at this day: as he that by all likelyhood, hauing no word at hand to rime to 
this word [<hi>ioy</hi>] he made his other verse ende in [<hi>Roy</hi>] saying 
very impudently thus, 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>O mightie Lord of loue, dame Venus onely ioy</hi>
                        <pb n="68"/>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Who art the highest God of any heauenly Roy</hi>. </l>
                  </q>


               </p>
               <p>Which word was neuer yet receiued in our language for an English word. 
Such extreme licentiousnesse is vtterly to be banished from our schoole, 
and better it might haue bene borne with in old riming writers, bycause they 
liued in a barbarous age, &amp; were graue morall men but very homely 
Poets, such also as made most of their workes by translation out of the 
Latine and French toung, &amp; few or none of their owne engine as may 
easely be knowen to them that lift to looke vpon the Poemes of both 
languages. 


</p>
               <p>Finally as ye may ryme with wordes of all sortes, be they of many sillables 
or few, so neuerthelesse is there a choise by which to make your cadence 
(before remembred) most commendable, for some wordes of exceeding great 
length, which haue bene fetched from the Latine inkhorne or borrowed of 
strangers, the vse of them in ryme is nothing pleasant, sauing perchaunce to 
the common people, who reioyse much to be at playes and enterludes, and 
besides their naturall ignoraunce, haue at all such times their eares so 
attentiue to the matter, and their eyes vpon the shewes of the stage, that 
they take little heede to the cunning of the rime, and therefore be as well 
satisfied with that which is grosse, as with any other finer and more 
delicate.

               <head>Of concorde in long and short measures, and by neare or farre distaunces, and which of them is most commendable.</head>
               <p>Bvt this ye must obserue withall, that bycause your concordes containe the 
chief part of Musicke in your meetre, their distaunces may not be too wide 
or farre a sunder, lest th'eare should loose the tune, and be defrauded of his 
delight, and whensoeuer ye see any maker vse large and extraordinary 
distaunces, ye must thinke he doth intende to shew himselfe more 
artificiall then popular, and yet therein is not to be discommended, for 
respects that shalbe remembred in some other place of this booke. 


</p>
               <p>Note also that rime or concorde is not commendably vsed both in the end and 
middle of a verse, vnlesse it be in toyes and trifling Poesies, for it sheweth 
a certaine lightnesse either of the matter or of the makers head, albeit 
these common rimers vse it much, for <pb n="69"/>
as I sayd before, like as the Symphonie in a verse of great length, is (as it 
were) lost by looking after him, and yet may the meetre be very graue and 
stately: so on the other side doth the ouer busie and too speedy returne of 
one maner of tune, too much annoy &amp; as it were glut the eare, vnlesse it 
be in small &amp; popular Musickes song by these <hi>Cantabanqui</hi> vpon 
benches and barrels heads where they haue none other audience then boys or 
countrey fellowes that passe by them in the streete, or else by blind harpers 
or such like tauerne minstrels that giue a fit of mirth for a groat, &amp; 
their matters being for the most part stories of old time, as the tale of Sir 
<hi>Topas</hi>, the reportes of <hi>Beuis</hi> of <hi>Southampton</hi>, <hi>Guy</hi>
of <hi>Warwicke</hi>, <hi>Adam Bell</hi>, and <hi>Clymme</hi> of the 
<hi>Clough</hi> &amp; such other old Romances or historicall rimes, made 
purposely for recreation of the common people at Christmasse diners &amp; 
brideales, and in tauernes &amp; alehouses and such other places of base 
resort, also they be vsed in Carols and rounds and such light or lasciuious 
Poemes, which are commonly more commodiously vttered by these bussons 
or vices in playes then by any other person. Such were the rimes of 
<hi>Skelton</hi> (vsurping the name of a Poet Laureat) being in deede but a 
rude rayling rimer &amp; all his doings ridiculous, he vsed both short 
distaunces and short measures pleasing onely the popular eare: in euery song 
or ditty concorde by compasse &amp; concorde entertangled and a mixt of 
both, what that is and how they be vsed shalbe declared in the chapter of 
proportion by <hi>scituation</hi>.

            </div>
            <div xml:id="c2.7" type="chapter">
               <head>Of proportion by situation.</head>
               <p>This proportion consisteth in placing of euery verse in a staffe or ditty by 
such reasonable distaunces, as may best serue the eare for delight, and also 
to shew the Poets art and variety of Musick, and the proportion is double. 
One by marshalling the meetres, and limiting their distaunces hauing regard 
to the rime or concorde how they go and returne: another by placing euery 
verse, hauing a regard to his measure and quantitie onely, and not to his 
concorde as to set one short meetre to three long, or foure short and two 
long, or a short measure and a long, or of diuers <pb n="70"/>
lengthes with relation one to another, which maner of <hi>Situation</hi>, euen 
without respect of the rime, doth alter the nature of the Poesie, and make it 
either lighter or grauer, or more merry, or mournfull, and may wayes 
passionate to the eare and hart of the hearer, seeming for this point that our 
maker by his measures and concordes of sundry proportions doth counterfait 
the harmonicall tunes of the vocall and instrumentall Musickes. As the 
<hi>Dorien</hi> because his falls, sallyes and compasse be diuers from those 
of the <hi>Phrigien</hi>, the <hi>Phrigien</hi> likewise from the <hi>Lydien</hi>, 
and all three from the <hi>Eolien, Miolidien</hi> and <hi>Ionien</hi>, mounting 
the falling from note to note such as be to them peculiar, and with more or 
lesse leasure or precipation. Euen so by diuersitie of placing and scituation 
of your measures and concords, a short with a long, and by narrow or wide 
distaunces, or thicker or thinner bestowing of them your proportions differ, 
and breedeth a variable and strange harmonie not onely in the eare, but also 
in the conceit of them that heare it: whereof this may be an ocular example. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Where ye see the concord or rime in the third distance, and the measure in 
the fourth, sixth or second distaunces, whereof ye may deuise as many other 
as ye lift, so the staffe be able to beare it. And I set you downe an occular 
example: because ye may the better conceiue it. Likewise it so falleth out 
most times your occular proportion doeth declare the nature of the audible: 
for if it please the eare well, the same represented by delineation to the 
view pleaseth the eye well and <hi>e conuerso</hi>: and this is by a naturall 
<hi>simpathie</hi>, betweene the eare and the eye, and betweene tunes &amp; 
colours, euen as there is the like betweene the other sences and their 
obiects of which it appeteineth not here to speake. Now for the distances 
vsually obserued in our vulgar Poesie, they be in the first second third and 
fourth verse, or if the verse be very short in the fift and sixt and in some 
maner of Musickes farre aboue. 


</p>
               <p>And the first distance for the most part goeth all by <hi>distick</hi> or 
couples of verses agreeing in one cadence, and do passe so speedily <pb n="71"/>
away and so often returne agayne, as their tunes are neuer lost, nor out of 
the eare, one couple supplying another so nye and so suddenly, and this is the 
most vulgar proportion of distance of situation, such as vsed <hi>Chaucer</hi>
in his Canterbury tales, and <hi>Gower</hi> in all his workes. <figure/>


               </p>
               <p>Second distance is, when ye passe ouer one verse, and ioyne the first and the 
third, and so continue on till an other like distance fall in, and this is also 
vsuall and common, as <figure/>


               </p>
               <p>Third distaunce is, when your rime falleth vpon the first and fourth verse 
ouerleaping two, this maner is not so common but pleasant and allowable 
inough. <figure/>


               </p>
               <p>In which case the two verses ye leaue out are ready to receiue their 
concordes by the same distaunce or any other ye like better. The fourth 
distaunce is by ouerskipping three verses and lighting vpon the fift, this 
maner is rare and more artificiall then popular, vnlesse it be in some 
speciall case, as when the meetres be so little and short as they make no 
shew of any great delay before they returne, ye shall haue example of both. 
<figure/>


               </p>
               <p>And these ten litle meeters make but one <hi>Exameter</hi> at length. 


</p>
               <p>--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--, 


</p>
               <p>There be larger distances also, as when the first concord falleth vpon the 
sixt verse, &amp; is very pleasant if they be ioyned with other distances not 
so large, as <figure/>. 


</p>
               <p>There be also, of the seuenth, eight, tenth, and twefth distance, but then 
they may not go thicke, but two or three such distances serue to proportion 
a whole song, and all between must be of other lesse distances, and these 
wide distaunces serue for coupling of staues, or for to declare high and 
passionate or graue matter, and also for art: <hi>Petrarch</hi> hath giuen vs 
examples hereof in his <hi>Canzoni</hi>, and we by lines of sundry lengths 
&amp; distances as followeth, <figure/>. 


</p>
               <p>And all that can be obiected against this wide distance is to say that the 
eare by loosing his concord is not satisfied. So is in deede the rude and 
popular eare but not the learned, and therefore the <pb n="72"/>
Poet must know to whose eare he maketh his rime, and accommodate 
himselfe thereto, and not giue such musicke to the rude and barbarous, as he 
would to the learned and delicate eare. 


</p>
               <p>There is another sort of proportion vsed by <hi>Petrarche</hi> called the 
<hi>Seizino</hi>, not riming as other songs do, but by chusing sixe wordes out 
of which all the whole dittie is made, euery of those sixe commencing and 
ending his verse by course, which restraint to make the dittie sensible will 
try the maker cunning, as thus. 


</p>
               <p>Besides all this there is in <hi>Situation</hi> of the concords two other 
points, one that it go by plaine and cleere compasse not intangled: another 
by enterweauing one with another by knots, or as it were by band, which is 
more or lesse busie and curious, all as the maker will double or redouble his 
rime or concords, and set his distances farre or nigh, of all which I will giue 
you ocular examples, as thus. 
<figure/>
And first in a <hi>Quadreine</hi> there are but two proportions, for foure 
verses in this last sort coupled, are but two <hi>Disticks</hi>, and not a staffe 
<hi>quadreine</hi> or of foure. 


</p>
               <p>The staffe of fiue hath seuen proportions, as <figure/> whereof some of them 
be harsher and vnpleasaunter to the eare then other some be. 


</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixaine</hi> or staffe of sixe hath ten proportions, whereof some be 
vsuall, some not vsuall, and not so sweet one as another. <figure/>


               </p>
               <p>The staffe of seuen verses hath seuen proportions, whereof one onely is the 
vsuall of our vulgar, and kept by our old Poets <hi>Chaucer</hi> and other in 
their historicall reports and other ditties: as in the last part of them that 
follow next. <figure/>
                  <pb n="73"/>
The <hi>huitain</hi> or staffe of eight verses, hath eight proportions such as 
the former staffe, and because he is longer, he hath one more then the 
<hi>settaine</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>The staffe of nine verses hath yet moe then the eight, and the staffe often 
more then the ninth and the twelfth, if such were allowable in ditties, more 
then any of them all, by reason of his largenesse receiuing moe compasses 
and enterweauings, alwayes considered that the very large distances be 
more artificiall, then popularly pleasant, and yet do giue great grace and 
grauitie, and moue passion and affections more vehemently, as it is well to 
be obserued by <hi>Petrarcha</hi> his <hi>Canzoni</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Now ye may perceiue by these proportions before described, that there is a 
band to be giuen euery verse in a staffe, so as none fall out alone or 
vncoupled, and this band maketh that the staffe is sayd fast and not loose: 
euen as ye see in buildings of stone or bricke the mason giueth a band, that 
is a length to two breadths, &amp; vpon necessitie diuers other sorts of 
bands to hold in the worke fast and maintaine the perpendicularitie of the 
wall: so in any staffe of seuen or eight or more verses, the coupling of the 
moe meeters by rime or concord, is the faster band: the fewer the looser 
band, and therefore in a <hi>huiteine</hi> he that putteth foure verses in one 
concord and foure in another concord, and in a <hi>dizaine</hi> fiue, sheweth 
him selfe more cunning, and also more copious in his owne language. For he 
that can find two words of concord, can not find foure or fiue or sixe, 
vnlesse he haue his owne language at will. Sometime also ye are driuen of 
necessitie to close and make band more then ye would, left otherwise the 
staffe should fall asunder and seeme two staues: and this is in a staffe of 
eight and ten verses: whereas without a band in the middle, it would seeme 
two <hi>quadriens</hi> or two <hi>quintaines</hi>, which is an error that many 
makers slide away with. Yet <hi>Chaucer</hi> and others in the staffe of 
seuen and fixe do almost as much a misse, for they shut vp the staffe with a 
<hi>disticke</hi>, concording with none other verse that went before, and 
maketh but a loose rime, and yet bycause of the double cadence in the last 
two verse serue the eare well inough. And as there is in euery staffe, band, 
giuen to the verses by concord more or lesse busie: so is there is in some 
cases a band giuen to euery staffe, <pb n="74"/>
and that is by one whole verse running alone throughout the ditty or ballade, 
either in the middle or end of euery staffe. The Greekes called such 
vncoupled verse <hi>Epimonie</hi>, the Latines <hi>Versus intercalaris</hi>. 
Now touching the situation of measures, there are as manie or more 
proportions of them which I referre to the makers phantasie and choise, 
contented with two or three ocular examples and no moe. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Which maner of proportion by situation of measures giueth more efficacie to 
the matter oftentimes then the concords them selues, and both proportions 
concurring together as they needes must, it is of much more beautie and 
force to the hearers mind. 


</p>
               <p>To finish the learning of this diuision, I will set you downe one example of a 
dittie written extempore with this deuise, shewing not onely much 
promptnesse of wit in the maker, but also great arte and a notable memorie. 
Make me saith this writer to one of the companie, so many strokes or lines 
with your pen as ye would haue your song containe verses: and let euery line 
beare his seuerall length, euen as ye would haue your verse of measure. 
Suppose of foure, fiue, sixe or eight or more sillables, and set a figure of 
euerie number at th'end of the line, whereby ye may knowe his measure. 
Then where you will haue your time or concord to fall, marke ti with a 
compast stroke or semicircle passing ouer those lines, be they farre or 
neare in distance, as ye haue seene before described. And bycause ye shall 
not thinke the maker hath premeditated beforehand any such fashioned ditty, 
do ye your selfe make one verse whether it be of perfect or imperfect sense, 
and giue it him for a theame to make all the rest vpon: if ye shall perceiue 
the maker do keepe the measures and rime as ye haue appointed him, and 
besides do make his dittie sensible and ensuant to the first verse in good 
reason, then may ye say he is his crafts maister. For if he were not of a 
plentiful discourse, he could not vpon the sudden shape an entire dittie vpon 
your imperfect theame or proposition in one <pb n="75"/>
verse. And if he were not copious in his language, he could not haue such 
store of wordes at commandement, as should supply your concords. And if 
he were not of a maruelous good memory he could not obserue the rime and 
measures after the distances of your limitation, keeping with all grauitie 
and good sense in the whole dittie.

               <head>Of Proportion in figure.</head>
               <p>Your last proportion is that of figure, so called for that it yelds an ocular 
representation, your meeters being by good symmetrie reduced into certaine 
Geometricall figures, whereby the maker is restrained to keepe him within 
his bounds, and sheweth not onely more art, but serueth also much better for 
briefenesse and subtiltie of deuice. And for the same respect are also 
fittest for the pretie amourets in Court to entertaine their seruants and the 
time withall, their delicate wits requiring some commendable exercise to 
keepe them from idlenesse. I find not of this proportion vsed by any of the 
Greeke or Latine Poets, or in any vulgar writer, sauing of that one forme 
which they cal <hi>Anacreens egge</hi>. But being in Italie conuersant with a 
certaine gentleman, who had long trauailed the Orientall parts of the world, 
and seene the Courts of the great Princes of China and Tartarie. I being very 
inquisitiue to know of the subtillities of those countreyes, and especially in 
matter of learning and of their vulgar Poesie, he told me that they are in all 
their inuentions most wittie, and haue the vse of Poesie or riming, but do 
not delight so much as we do in long tedious descriptions, and therefore 
when they will vtter any pretie conceit, they reduce it into metricall feet, 
and put it in forme of a <hi>Lozange</hi> or square, or such other figure, and 
so engrauen in gold, siluer or iuorie, and sometimes with letters of ametist, 
rubie, emeralde or topas curiousely cemented and peeced together, they 
sende them in chaines, bracelets, collars and girdles to their mistresses to 
weare for a remembrance. Some fewe measures composed in this sort this 
gentleman gaue me, which I translated word for word and as neere as I could 
followed both the phrase and the figure, which is somewhat hard to 
performe, because of the restraint of the figure from which ye may not 
digresse. At the beginning they wil seeme <pb n="76"/>
nothing pleasant to an English eare, but time and vsage wil make them 
acceptable inough, as it doth in all other new guises, be it for wearing of

may be the cause as I suppose why they also gaue that name to the fish 
commonly called the <hi>Turbot</hi>, who beareth iustly that figure, it ought

that he is sharper and slenderer. I will giue you an example or two of those

</p>
               <p>The Triangle is an halfe square, <hi>Lozange</hi> or <hi>Fuzie</hi> parted vpon 
the croste angles: and so his base being brode and his top narrow, it 
receaueth meetres of many sizes one shorter then another: and ye may vse 
this figure standing or reuersed, as thus. 


</p>
               <p>A certaine great Sultan of Persia called <hi>Ribuska</hi>, entertaynes in loue 
the Lady <hi>Selamour</hi>, sent her this triquet reuest pitiously bemoning his 
estate, all set in merquetry with letters of blew Saphire and Topas 
artificially cut and entermingled.

               <p>This condition seeming to Sultan <hi>Ribuska</hi> very hard to performe, and

not.

                  <hi>Of the Spire or Taper called Pyramis</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Taper is the longest and sharpest triangle that is, &amp; while he 
mounts vpward he waxeth continually more slender, taking both his figure 
and name of the fire, whose flame if ye marke it is alwaies pointed and 
naturally by his forme couets to clymbe: the <pb n="79"/>
Greekes call him Pyramis of <foreign xml:lang="el">pur</foreign>. The Latines in vse of 
Architecture call him <hi>Obeliscus</hi>, it holdeth the altitude of six 
ordinary triangles, and in metrifying his base can not well be larger then a 
meetre of six, therefore in his altitude he wil require diuers rabates to hold 
so many sizes of meetres as shall serue for his composition, for neare the 
toppe there wilbe roome litle inough for a meetre of two sillables, and 
sometimes of one to finish the point. I haue set you downe one or two 
examples to try how ye can disgest the maner of the deuise.

               <p>
                  <hi>Her Maiestie, for many parts in her most noble and vertuous nature to be 
found, resembled to the spire. Ye must begin beneath according to the 
nature of the deuice</hi>.

</p>
               <p>The Piller is a figure among all the rest of the Geometricall most 
beawtifull, in respect that he is tall and vpright and of one bignesse from 
the bottom to the toppe. In Architecture he is considered with two 
accessarie parts, a pedestall or base, and a chapter or head, the body is the 
shaft. By this figure is signified stay, support, rest, state and 
magnificence, your dittie then being reduced into the forme of a Piller, his 
base will require to beare the breath of a meetre of six or seuen or eight 
sillables: the shaft of foure: the chapter egall with the base, of this 
proportion I will giue you one or two examples which may suffise.

</p>
               <p>The most excellent of all the figures Geometrical is the round for his many 
perfections. First because he is euen &amp; smooth, without any angle, or 
interruption, most voluble and apt to turne, and to continue motion, which 
is the author of life: he conteyneth in him the commodious description of 
euery other figure, &amp; for his indefinitenesse hauing no speciall place of 
beginning nor end, beareth a similitude with God and eternitie. This figure 
hath three principall partes in his nature and vse much considerable: the 
circle, the beame, and the center. The circle is his largest compasse or 
circumference: the center is his middle and indiuisible point: the beame is 
a line stretching directly from the circle to the center, &amp; contrariwise 
from the center to the circle. By this description our maker may fashion his 
meetre in Roundel, either with the circumference, and that is circlewise, or 
from the circumference, that is, like a beame, or by the circumference, and 
that is ouerthwart and dyametrally from one side of the circle to the other.

               <p>
                  <hi>Of the square or quadrangle equilater</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>The square is of all other accompted the figure of most solliditie and 
stedfastnesse, and for his owne stay and firmitie requireth none other base 
then himselfe, and therefore as the roundell or Spheare is appropriat to the 
heauens, the Spire to the element of the fire: the Triangle to the ayre, and 
the Lozange to the water: so is the square for his inconcussable steadinesse 
likened to the earth, which perchaunce might be the reason that the Prince 
of Philosophers in his first booke of the <hi>Ethicks</hi>, termeth a constant 
minded man, euen egal and direct on all sides, and not easily ouerthrowne by 
euery litle aduersitie, <hi>hominem quadratum</hi>, a square man. Into this 
figure may ye reduce your ditties by vsing no moe verses then your verse is 
of sillables, which will make him fall out square, if ye go aboue it wil grow 
into the figure <hi>Trapezion</hi>, which is some portion longer then square. I 
neede not giue you any example, bycause in good arte all your ditties, Odes 
&amp; Epigrammes should keepe &amp; not exceede the nomber of twelue 
verses, and the longest verse to be of twelue sillables &amp; not aboue, but 
vnder that number as much as ye will. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The figure Ouall</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>This figure taketh his name of an egge, and also as it is thought <pb n="84"/>
his first origine, and is as it were a bastard or imperfect rounde declining 
toward a longitude, and yet keeping within one line for her periferie or 
compasse as the rounde, and it seemeth that he receiueth this forme not as 
an imperfection by any impediment vnnaturally hindring his rotunditie, but 
by the wisedome and prouidence of nature for the commoditie of generation, 
in such of her creatures as being not forth a liuely body (as do foure footed 
beasts) but in stead thereof a certaine quantitie of shapelesse matter 
contained in a vessell, which after it is sequestred from the dames body 
receiueth life and perfection, as in the egges of birdes, fishes, and serpents: 
for the matter being of some quantitie, and to issue out at a narrow place, 
for the easie passage thereof, it must of necessitie beare such shape as 
might not be sharpe and greeuous to passe as an angle, nor so large or obtuse 
as might not essay some issue out with one part moe then other as the 
rounde, therefore it must be slenderer in some part &amp; yet not without a 
rotunditie &amp; smoothnesse to giue the rest and easie deliuerie. Such is 
the figure Ouall whom for his antiquitie, dignitie and vse, I place among the 
rest of the figures to embellish our proportions: of this sort are diuers of 
<hi>Anacreons</hi> ditties, and those other of the Grecian Liricks, who wrate 
wanton amorous deuises, to solace their witts with all, and many times 
they would (to giue it right shape of an egge) deuide a word in the midst, and 
peece out the next verse with the other halfe, as ye may see by perusing 
their meetres. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the deuice or embleme, and that other which the Greekes call 
Anagramma, and we the Posie transposed</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>And besides all the remembred points of Metricall proportion, ye haue yet 
two other sorts of some affinitie with them, which also first issued out of 
the Poets head, and whereof the Courtly maker was the principall artificer, 
hauing many high conceites and curious imaginations, with leasure inough to 
attend his idle inuentions: and these be the short, quicke and sententious 
propositions, such as be at these dayes all your deuices of armes and other 
amorous inscriptions which courtiers vse to giue and also to weare in 
liuerie for the honour of their ladies, and commonly containe but two or 
three words of wittie sentence or secrete conceit till they <pb n="85"/>
vnfolded or explaned by some interpretation. For which cause they be 
commonly accompanied with a figure or purtraict of ocular representation, 
the words so aptly corresponding to the subtiltie of the figure, that aswel 
the eye is therwith recreated as the eare or the mind. The Greekes call it 
<hi>Emblema</hi>, the Italiens <hi>Impresa</hi>, and we, a Deuice, such as a man 
may put into letters of gold and sende to his mistresse for a token, or cause 
to be embrodered in scutchions of armes, or in any bordure of a rich garment 
to giue by his noueltie maruell to the beholder. Such were the figures and 
inscriptions the Romane Emperours gaue in their money and coignes of 
largesse, and in other great medailles of siluer and gold, as that of the 
Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi>, an arrow entangled by the fish <hi>Remora</hi>, 
with these words, <hi>Festina lento</hi>, signifying that celeritie is to be 
vsed with deliberation: all great enterprises being for the most part either 
ouerthrowen with hast or hindred by delay, in which case leasure in 
th'aduice, and speed in th'execution make a very good match for a glorious 
successe. 


</p>
               <p>Th'Emperour <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> by his name alluding to the sunne, which in 
Greeke is <hi>Helios</hi>, gaue for his deuice, the coelestial sunne, with these 
words [<hi>Soliinuicto</hi>] the subtiltie lyeth in the word [<hi>sol</hi>] which 
hath a double sense, viz. to the Sunne, and to him onely. 


</p>
               <p>We our selues attributing that most excellent figure, for his incomparable 
beauty and light, to the person of our Soueraigne lady altring the mot, made 
it farre passe that of Th'Emperour <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> both for subtiltie and 
multiplicitie of sense, thus, [<hi>Soli nunquam deficienti</hi>] to her onely 
that neuer failes, viz. in bountie and munificence toward all hers that 
deserue, or else thus, To her onely (whose glorie and good fortune may neuer 
decay or wane). And so it inureth as a wish by way of resemblaunce in 
[<hi>Simile dissimile</hi>] which is also a subtillitie likening her Maiestie to 
the Sunne for his brightnesse, but not to him for his passion, which is 
ordinarily to go to glade, and sometime to suffer eclypse. 


</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edwarde</hi> the thirde, her Maiesties most noble progenitour, first 
founder of the famous order of the Garter, gaue this posie with it. <hi>Hony 
soit qui mal y pense</hi>, commonly thus Englished, Ill be to him that 
thinketh ill, but in mine opinion better thus, Dishonored be he, who meanes 
vnhonorably. <pb n="86"/>
There can not be a more excellent deuise, nor that could containe 
larger intendment, nor greater subtiltie, nor (as a man may say) more vertue 
or Princely generositie. For first he did by it mildly &amp; grauely reproue 
the peruers construction of such noble men in his court, as imputed the 
kings wearing about his neck the garter of the lady with whom he danced, to 
some amorous alliance betwext them, which was not true. He also iustly 
defended his owne integritie, saued the noble womans good renowme, which 
by licentious speeches might haue bene empaired, and liberally recompenced 
her iniurie with an honor, such as none could haue bin deuised greater nor 
more glorious or permanent vpon her and all the posteritie of her house. It 
inureth also as a worthy lesson and discipline for all Princely personages, 
whose actions, imaginations, countenances and speeches, should euermore 
corrrespond in all trueth and honorable simplicitie. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the fift Emperour, euen in his yong yeares shewing his valour 
and honorable ambition, gaue for his new order, the golden Fleece, vsurping 
it vpon Prince Iason &amp; his Argonants rich spoile brought from 
<hi>Cholcos</hi>. But for his deuice two pillers with this mot <hi>Plus 
ultra</hi>, as one not content to be restrained within the limits that 
<hi>Hercules</hi> had set for an vttermost bound to all his trauailes, viz. two 
pillers in the mouth of the straight <hi>Gibraltare</hi>, but would go furder: 
which came fortunately to passe, and whereof the good successe gaue great 
commendation to his deuice: for by the valiancy of his Captaines before he 
died he conquered great part of the west Indias, neuer knowen to 
<hi>Hercules</hi> or any of our world before. 


</p>
               <p>In the same time (seeming that the heauens and starres had conspired to 
replenish the earth with Princes and gouernours of great courage, and most 
famous conquerous) <hi>Selim</hi> Emperour of Turkie gaue for his deuice a 
croissant or new moone, promising to him self increase of glory and 
enlargement of empire, til he had brought all Asia vnder his subiection, 
which he reasonably well accomplished. For in lesse then eight yeres which 
he raigned, he conquered all Syria and Egypt, and layd it to his dominion. 
This deuice afterward was vsurped by <hi>Henry</hi> the second French king, 
with this mot <hi>Donec totum compleat orbem</hi>, till he be at his full: 
meaning it not so largely as did <hi>Selim</hi>, but onely that his friendes 
should know <pb n="87"/>
how vnable he was to do them good, and to shew beneficence vntil he 
attained the crowne of France vnto which he aspired as next successour. 


</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, a valiant and magnanimous prince, who 
because hee was on euery side enuironed with mightie neighbours, and most 
of them his enemies, to let them perceiue that they should not fine him 
vnable or vnfurnished (incase they should offer any vnlawfull hostilitie) of 
suffificient forces of his owne, aswell to offende as to defend, and to 
reuenge an iniurie as to repulse it. He gaue for his deuice the Porkespick 
with this posie <hi>pres &amp; loign</hi>, both farre and neare. For the 
Purpentines nature is, to such as stand aloofe, to dart her prickles from her, 
and if they come neare her, with the same as they sticke fast to wound them 
that hurt her. 


</p>
               <p>But of late yeares in the ransacke of the Cities of <hi>Cartagena</hi> and S. 
<hi>Dominico</hi> in the West Indies, manfully put in execution by the 
prowesse of her Maiesties men, there was found a deuice made peraduenture 
without King <hi>Philips</hi> knowledge, wrought al in massiue copper, a king 
sitting on horsebacke vpon a <hi>monde</hi> or world, the horse prauncing 
forward with his forelegges as if he would leape of, with this inscription, 
<hi>Non sufficit orbis</hi>, meaning, as it is to be conceaued, that one whole 
world could not content him. This immeasurable ambition of the Spaniards, 
if her Maiestie by Gods prouidence, had not with her forces, prouidently 
stayed and retranched, no man knoweth what inconuenience might in time 
haue insued to all the Princes and common wealthes in Christendome, who 
haue founde them selues long annoyed with his excessiue greatnesse. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atila</hi> king of the Huns, inuading France with an army of 300000 
fighting men, as it is reported, thinking vtterly to abbase the glory of the 
Romane Empire, gaue for his deuice of armes, a sword with a firie point and 
these words, <hi>Ferro &amp; flamma</hi>, with sword and fire. This very 
deuice being as ye see onely accommodate to a king or conquerour and not a 
coillen or any meane souldier, a certaine base man of England being knowen 
euen at that time a bricklayer or mason by his science, gaue for his crest: 
whom it had better become to beare a truell full of morter than a sword and 
fire, which <pb n="88"/>
is onely the reuenge of a Prince, and lieth not in any other mans abilitie to 
performe, vnlesse ye will allow it to euery poore knaue that is able to set 
fire on a thacht house. The heraldes ought to vse great discretion in such 
matters: for neither any rule of their arte doth warrant such absurdities, 
nor though such a coat or crest were gained by a prisoner taken in the field, 
or by a flag found in some ditch &amp; neuer fought for (as many times 
happens) yet is it no more allowable then it were to beare the deuice of 
<hi>Tamerlan</hi> an Emperour in Tartary, who gaue the lightning of heauen, 
with a posie in that language purporting these words, <hi>Ira Dei</hi>, which 
also appeared well to answer his fortune. For from a sturdie shepeheard he 
became a most mighty Emperour, and with his innumerable great armies 
desolated so many countreyes and people, as he might iustly be called 
[<hi>the wrath of God</hi>]. It appeared also by his strange ende: for in the 
midst of his greatnesse and prosperitie he died sodainly, &amp; left no child 
or kinred for a successour to so large an Empire, nor any memory after him 
more then of his great puissance and crueltie. 


</p>
               <p>But that of the king of China in the fardest part of the Orient, though it be 
not so terrible is no lesse admirable, &amp; of much sharpnesse and good 
implication, worthy for the greatest king and conquerour: and it is, two 
strange serpents entertangled in their amorous congresse, the lesser 
creeping with his head into the greaters mouth, with the words purporting 
[<hi>ama &amp; time</hi>] loue &amp; feare. Which posie with maruellous 
much reason and subtillity implieth the dutie of euery subiect to his Prince, 
and of euery Prince to his subiect, and that without either of them both, no 
subiect could be sayd entirely to performe his liegeance, nor the Prince his 
part of lawfull gouernement. For without feare and loue the soueraigne 
authority could not be vpholden, nor without iustice and mercy the Prince be 
renowmed and honored of his subiect. All which parts are discouered in this 
figure: loue by the serpents amorous entertangling: obedience and feare by 
putting the inferiours head into the others mouth hauing puissance to 
destroy. On th'other side, iustice in the greater to prepare and manace death 
and destruction to offenders. And if he spare it, then betokeneth it mercie, 
and a grateful recompence of the loue and obedience which the soueraigne 
receaueth. 
<pb n="89"/>

               </p>
               <p>It is also worth the telling, how the king vseth the same in pollicie, he 
giueth it in his ordinarie liueries to be worne in euery vpper garment of all 
his noblest men and greatest Magistrats &amp; the rest of his officers and 
seruants, which are either embrodered vpon the breast and the back with 
siluer or gold or pearle or stone more or lesse richly, according to euery 
mans dignitie and calling, and they may not presume to be seene in publick 
without them: nor also in any place where by the kings commission they vse 
to sit in iustice, or any other publike affaire, wherby the king is highly both 
honored and serued, the common people retained in dutie and admiration of 
his greatnesse: the noblemen, magistrats and officers euery one in his 
degree so much esteemed &amp; reuerenced as in their good and loyall 
seruice they want vnto their persons litle lesse honour for the kings sake, 
then can be almost due or exhibited to the king him selfe. 


</p>
               <p>I could not forbeare to adde this forraine example to accomplish our 
discourse touching deuices. For the beauty and gallantnesse of it, besides 
the subtillitie of the conceit, and princely pollicy in the vse, more exact 
then can be remembred in any other of any <hi>European</hi> Prince, whose 
deuises I will not say but many of them be loftie and ingenious, many of 
them louely and beautifull, many other ambitious and arrogant, and the 
chiefest of them terrible and ful of horror to the nature of man, but that any 
of them be comparable with it, for wit, vertue, grauitie, and if ye lift 
brauerie, honour and magnificence, not vsurping vpon the peculiars of the 
gods. In my conceipt there is none to be found. 


</p>
               <p>This may suffice for deuices, a terme which includes in his generality all 
those other, viz. liueries, cognizances, emblemes, enfeigns and impreses. 
For though the termes be diuers, the vse and intent is but one whether they 
rest in colour or figure or both, or in word or in muet shew, and that is to 
insinuat some secret, wittie morall and braue purpose presented to the 
beholder, either to recreate his eye, or please his phantasie, or examine his 
iudgement or occupie his braine or to manage his will either by hope or by 
dread, euery of which respectes be of no litle moment to the interest 
and ornament of the ciuill life: and therefore giue them no litle 
commendation. Then hauing produced so many worthy and wise founders <pb n="90"/>
of these deuices, and so many puissant patrons and protectours of them, I 
feare no reproch in this discourse, which otherwise the venimous appetite 
of enuie by detraction or scorne would peraduenture not sticke to offer me. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Anagrame, or posie transposed</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>One other pretie conceit we will impart vnto you and then trouble you with 
no more, and is also borrowed primitiuely of the Poet, or courtly maker, we 
may terme him, the [<hi>posie transposed</hi>] or in one word [<hi>a 
transpose</hi>] a thing if it be done for pastime and exercise of the wit 
without superstition commendable inough and a meete study for Ladies, 
neither bringing them any great gayne nor any great losse vnlesse it be of 
idle time. They that vase it for pleasure is to breed one word out of another 
not altering any letter nor the number of them, but onely transposing of the 
same, wherupon many times is produced some grateful newes or matter to 
them for whose pleasure and seruice it was intended: and bicause there is 
much difficultie in it, and altogether standeth vpon hap hazard, it is 
compted for a courtly conceit no lesse then the deuice before remembred. 
<hi>Lycophron</hi> one of the seuen Greeke Lyrickes, who when they met together 
(as many times they did) for their excellencie and louely concorde, were 
called the seuen starres [<hi>pleiades</hi>] this man was very perfit &amp; 
fortunat in these transposes, &amp; for his delicate wit and other good 
parts was greatly fauoured by <hi>Ptoleme</hi> king of Egypt and Queene 
<hi>Arsinoe</hi> his wife. He after such sort called the king <foreign xml:lang="el">apoilitos</foreign>, 
which is letter for letter <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> and Queene <hi>Arsinoe</hi> he 
called <gap/>, which is <hi>Arsinoe</hi>, now the subtillitie lyeth not in the 
conuersion but in the sence in this that <hi>Apomelitos</hi>, signifieth in 
Greek [<hi>hony sweet</hi>] so was <hi>Ptolome</hi> the sweetest natured man 
in the world both for countenance and conditions, and <hi>Ioneras</hi>, 
signifieth the violet or flower of <hi>Iuno</hi> a stile among the Greekes for a 
woman endued with all bewtie and magnificence, which construction falling 
out grateful and so truly, exceedingly well pleased the King and the Queene, 
and got <hi>Lycophron</hi> no litle thanke and benefite at both their hands.

               <p>The French Gentlemen haue very sharpe witts and withall a 
delicate language, which may very easily be wrested to any alteration of 
words sententious, and they of late yeares haue taken this pastime vp among 
them many times gratifying their Ladies, and often times the Princes of the 
Realme, with some such thankfull noueltie. Whereof one made by 
<hi>François de Vallois</hi>, thus <hi>De façon suis Roy</hi>, who in 
deede was of fashion countenance and stature, besides his regall vertues a 
very king, for in a world there could not be seene a goodlier man of person. 
Another found this by <hi>Henry de Vallois</hi> [<hi>Roy de nulz hay</hi>] a king 
hated of no man, and was apparant in his conditions and nature, for there 
was not a Prince of greater affabilitie and mansuetude then he. 


</p>
               <p>I my selfe seing this conceit so well allowed of in Fraunce and Italie, and 
being informed that her Maiestie tooke pleasure sometimes in desciphring of 
names, and hearing how diuers Gentlemen of her Court had essayed but with 
no great felicitie to make some delectable transpose of her Maiesties name, 
I would needs try my luck, for cunning I know not why I should call it, 
vnlesse it be for the many and variable applications of sence, which 
requireth peraduenture some wit &amp; discretion more then of euery 
vnlearned man and for the purpose I tooke me these three wordes (if any 
other in the world) containing in my conceit greatest mysterie, and most 
importing good to all them that now be aliue, vnder her noble gouernement. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elissabet Anglorum Regina</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Which orthographie (because ye shall not be abused) is true &amp; not 
mistaken, for the letter <hi>zeta</hi>, of the Hebrewes &amp; Greeke and of all 
other toungs is in truth but a double ss hardly vttered, and H. is but a note of 
aspiration onely and no letter, which therefore is by the Greeks omitted. 
Vpon the transposition I found this to redound. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multa regnabis ense gloria. 
By they sword shalt thou raigne in great renowne</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Then transposing the word [<hi>ense</hi>] it came to be 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multa regnabis sene gloria. 
Aged and in much glorie shall ye raigne</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Both which resultes falling out vpon the very first marshalling of <pb n="92"/>
the letters, without any darknesse or difficultie, and so sensibly and well 
appropriat to her Maiesties person and estate, and finally so effectually to 
mine own wish (which is a matter of much moment in such cases) I tooke 
them both for a good boding, and very fatalitie to her Maiestie appointed by 
Gods prouidence for all our comfortes. Also I imputed it for no litle good 
luck and glorie to my selfe, to haue pronounced to her so good and 
prosperous a fortune, and so thankefull newes to all England, which though 
it cannot be said by this euent any destinie or fatal necessitie, yet surely is 
it by all probabillitie of reason, so likely to come to passe, as any other 
worldly euent of things that be vncertaine, her Maiestie continuing the 
course of her most regal proceedings and vertuous life in all earnest zeale 
and godly contemplation of his word, &amp; in the sincere administration of 
his terrene iustice, assigned ouer to her execution as his Lieutenance vpon 
earth within the compasse of her dominions. 


</p>
               <p>This also is worth the noting, and I will assure you of it, that as the first 
search whereupon this transpose was fashioned. The same letters being by 
me tossed &amp; tranlaced fiue hundreth times, I could neuer make any 
other, at least of some sence &amp; conformitie to her Maiesties estate and 
the case. If any other man by triall happen vpon a better omination, or what 
soeuer els ye will call it, I will reioyse to be ouermatched in my deuise, and 
renounce him all the thankes and profite of my trauaile. 


</p>
               <p>When I wrate of these deuices, I smiled with my selfe, thinking that the 
readers would do so to, and many of them say, that such trifles as these 
might well haue bene spared, considering the world is full inough of them, 
and that it is pitie mens heades should be fedde with such vanities as are to 
none edification nor instruction, either of morall vertue, or otherwise 
behooffull for the common wealth, to whose seruice (say they) we are all 
borne, and not to fill and replenish a whole world full of idle toyes. To 
which sort of reprehendours, being either all holy and mortified to the 
world, and therefore esteeming nothing that sauoureth not of Theologie, or 
altogether graue and worldly, and therefore caring for nothing but matters 
of pollicie, &amp; discourses of estate, or all giuen to thrift and passing for 
none art that is not gainefull and lucratiue, as the <pb n="93"/>
sciences of the Law, Phisicke and marchaundise: to these I will giue none 
other aunswere then referre them to the many trifling poemes of <hi>Homer, 
Ouid, Virgill, Catullus</hi> and other notable writers of former ages, which 
were not of any grauitie or seriousnesse, and many of them full of 
impudicitie and ribaudrie, as are not these of ours, nor for any good in the 
world should haue bene: and yet those trifles are come from many former 
siecles vnto our times, vncontrolled or condemned or supprest by any Pope 
or Patriarch or other seuere censor of the ciuill maner of men, but haue bene 
in all ages permitted as the conuenient solaces and recreations of mans wit. 
And as I can not denie but these conceits of mine be trifles: no lesse in very 
deede be all the most serious studies of man, if we shall measure grauitie 
and lightnesse by the wise mans ballance who after he had considered of all 
the profoundest artes and studies among men, in th'ende cryed out with this 
Epyphoneme <hi>Vanitas vanitatum &amp; omnia vanitas</hi>. Whose 
authoritie if it were not sufficient to make me belieue so, I could be content 
with <hi>Democritus</hi> rather to condemne the vanities of our life by 
derision, then as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> with teares, saying with that merrie 
Greeke thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Omnia sunt risus, sunt puluis, &amp; omnia nil sunt.</hi>

                  <hi>Res hominum cunctae, nam ratione carent</hi>.

               <p>Thus Englished,

                  <hi>For why in mans matters is neither rime nor reason</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Now passing from these courtly trifles, let vs talke of our scholastical 
toyes, that is of the Grammaticall versifying of the Greeks and Latines and 
see whether it might be reduced into our English arte or no.

               <head>How if all maner of sodaine innouations were not very scandalous, specially in the lawes of any langage or arte, the use of the Greeke and Latine feete might be brought into our vulgar Poesie, and with good grace inough.</head>
               <p>Now neuerthelesse albeit we haue before alledged that our vulgar <hi>Saxon 
English</hi> standing most vpon wordes <hi>monosillable</hi>, and little vpon 
<hi>polysillables</hi> doth hardly admit the vse of those <pb n="94"/>
fine inuented feete of the Greeks &amp; Latines, and that for the most part 
wise and graue men doe naturally mislike with all sodaine innouations 
specially of lawes (and this the law of our auncient English Poesie) and 
therefore lately before we imputed it to a nice &amp; scholasticall 
curiositie in such makers as haue sought to bring into our vulgar Poesie 
some of the auncient feete, to wit the <hi>Dactile</hi> into verses 
<hi>exameters</hi>, as he that translated certaine bookes of <hi>Virgils 
Eneydos</hi> in such measures &amp; not vncommendably: if I should now say 
otherwise it would make me seeme contradictorie to my selfe, yet for the 
information of our yong makers, and pleasure of all others who be delighted 
in noueltie, and to th'intent we may not seeme by ignorance of ouersight to 
omit any point of subtillitie, materiall or necessarie to our vulgar arte, we 
will in this present chapter &amp; by our own idle obseruations shew how 
one may easily and commodiously lead all those feete of the auncients into 
our vulgar language. And if mens eares were not perchaunce to daintie, or 
their iudgementes ouer partiall, would peraduenture nothing at all 
misbecome our arte, but make in our meetres a more pleasant numerositie 
then now is. Thus farre therefore we will aduenture and not beyond, to 
th'intent to shew some singularitie in our arte that euery man hath not 
heretofore obserued, and (her maiesty good liking always had) whether we 
make the common readers to laugh or to lowre, all is a matter, since our 
intent is not so exactlie to prosecute the purpose, nor so earnestly, as to 
thinke it should by authority of our owne iudgement be generally applauded 
at to the discredit of our forefathers maner of vulgar Poesie, or to the 
alteration or peraduenture totall destruction of the same, which could not 
stand with any good discretion or curtesie in vs to attempt, but thus much I 
say, that by some leasurable trauell it were not hard matter to induce all 
their auncient feete into vse with vs, and that it should proue very agreable 
to the eare and well according with our ordinary times and pronunciation, 
which no man could then iustly mislike, and that is to allow euery word 
<hi>polisillable</hi> one long time of necessitie, which should be where his 
sharpe accent falls in our owne <hi>ydiome</hi> most aptly and naturally, 
wherein we would not follow the license of the Greeks and Latines, who 
made not their sharpe accent any necessary prolongation <pb n="95"/>
of their times, but vsed such sillable sometimes long sometimes 
short at their pleasure. The other sillables of any word where the sharpe 
accent fell not to be accompted of such time and quantitie as his 
<hi>ortographie</hi> would best beare hauing regard to himselfe, or to his next 
neighbour, word, bounding him on either side, namely to the smoothnes 
&amp; hardnesse of the sillable in his vtterance, which is occasioned 
altogether by his <hi>ortographie</hi> &amp; scituation as in this word 
[<hi>dayly</hi>] the first sillable for his vsuall and sharpe accentes sake to be 
alwayes long, the second for his flat accents sake to be alwayes short, and 
the rather for his <hi>ortographie</hi>, bycause if he goe before another word 
commencing with a vowell not letting him to be eclipsed, his vtterance is 
easie &amp; currant, in this trisillable [<hi>daungerous</hi>] the first to be 
long, th'other two short for the same causes. In this word 
[<hi>dangerousnesse</hi>] the first &amp; last to be both long, bycause they 
receiue both of them the sharpe accent, and the two middlemost to be short, 
in these words [<hi>remedie</hi>] &amp; [<hi>remedilesse</hi>] the time to 
follow also the accent, so as if ti please better to set the sharpe accent 
vpon [<hi>re</hi>] then vpon [<hi>dye</hi>] that sillable should be made long and 
<hi>è conuerso</hi>, but in this word [<hi>remedilesse</hi>] bycause may 
like better to accent eh sillable [<hi>me</hi>] then the sillable [<hi>les</hi>] 
therefore I leaue him for a common sillable to be able to receiue both a long 
and a short time as occasion shall serue. The like law I set in these wordes 
[<hi>reuocable</hi>] [<hi>recouerable</hi>] [<hi>irreuocable</hi>] 
[<hi>irrecouerable</hi>] for sometime it sounds better to say <hi>reuocable</hi>
then <hi>reuocable</hi>, <hi>recouerable</hi> then <hi>recouerable</hi> for this one 
thing ye must alwayes marke that if your time fall either by reason of his 
sharpe accent or otherwise vpon the <hi>penultima</hi>, ye shal finde many 
other words to rime with him, bycause such terminations are not geazon, 
but if the long time fall vpon the <hi>antepenultima</hi> ye shall not finde 
many wordes to match him in his termination, which is the cause of his 
concord or rime, but if you would let your long time by his sharpe accent 
fall aboue the <hi>antepenultima</hi> as to say [<hi>couerable</hi>] ye shall 
seldome or perchance neuer find one to make vp rime with him vnlesse it be 
badly and by abuse, and therefore in all such long <hi>polisillables</hi> ye doe 
commonly giue two sharpe accents, and thereby reduce him into two feete 
as in this word [<hi>remu neration</hi>] which makes a couple of good 
<hi>Dactils</hi>, and <pb n="96"/>
in this word [<hi>contribution</hi>] which makes a good <hi>spondeus</hi> &amp; 
a good <hi>dactill</hi>, and in this word [<hi>recapitulation</hi>] it makes two 
<hi>dactills</hi> and a sillable ouerplus to annexe to the word precedent to 
helpe peece vp another foote. But for wordes <hi>monosillables</hi> (as be 
most of ours) because in pronouncing them they do of necessitie retaine a 
sharpe accent, ye may iustly allow them to be all long if they will so best 
serue your turne, and if they be tailed one to another, or th'one to a 
<hi>disillable</hi> or <hi>polysillable</hi> ye ought to allow them that time that 
best serues your purpose and pleaseth your eare most, and truliest 
aunsweres the nature of the <hi>ortographie</hi> in which I would as neare as 
I could obserue and keepe the lawes of the Greeke and Latine versifiers, that 
is to prolong the sillable which is written with double consonants or by 
dipthong or with single consonants that run hard and harshly vpon the toung: 
and to shorten all sillables that stand vpon vowels, if there were no cause 
of <hi>elision</hi> and single consonants &amp; such of them as are most 
flowing and slipper vpon the toung as <hi>n. r. t. d. l.</hi> and for this purpose 
to take away all aspirations, and many times the last consonant of a word 
as the Latine Poetes vsed to do, specially <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Ennius</hi>
as to say [<hi>finibu</hi>] for [<hi>finibus</hi>] and so would not I stick to say 
thus [<hi>delite</hi>] for [<hi>delight</hi>] [<hi>hye</hi>] for [<hi>high</hi>] and such 
like, &amp; doth nothing at all impugne the rule I gaue before against the 
wresting of wordes by false <hi>ortographie</hi> to make vp rime, which may 
not be falsified. But this omission of letters in the middest of a meetre to 
make him the more slipper, helpes the numerositie and hinders not the rime. 
But generally the shortning or prolonging of the <hi>monosillables</hi>
dependes much vpon the nature of their <hi>ortographie</hi> which the Latin 
grammariens call the rule of position, as for example if I shall say thus. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not manie dayes past</hi>. Twentie dayes after. 


</p>
               <p>This makes a good <hi>Dactill</hi> and a good <hi>spondeus</hi>, but if ye turne 
them backward it would not do so, as. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many dayes not past</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>And the <hi>distick</hi> made all of <hi>monosillables</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>But none of us true men and free,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Could finde so great good lucke as he</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Which words serue well to make the verse all <hi>spondiacke</hi> or 
<hi>iambicke</hi>, but not in <hi>dactil</hi>, as other words or the same 
otherwise placed <pb n="97"/>
would do, for it were an illfauored <hi>dactil</hi> to say. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But none of, us all trewe</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Therefore whensoeuer your words will not make a smooth <hi>dactil</hi>, ye 
must alter them or their situations, or else turne them to other feete that 
may better beare their maner of sound and orthographie: or if the word be 
<hi>polysillable</hi> to deuide him, and to make him serue by peeces, that he 
could not do whole and entierly. And no doubt by like consideration did the 
Greeke &amp; Latine versifiers fashion all their feete at the first to be of 
sundry times, and the selfe same sillable to be sometime long and sometime 
short for the eares better satisfaction as hath bene before remembred. Now 
also wheras I said before that our old Saxon English for his many 
<hi>monosillables</hi> did not naturally admit the vse of the ancient feete in 
our vulgar measures so aptly as in those languages which stood most vpon 
<hi>polisillables</hi>, I sayd it in a sort truly, but now I must recant and 
confesse that our Normane English which hath grown since <hi>William</hi>
the Conquerour doth admit any of the auncient feete, by reason of the many 
<hi>polysillables</hi> euen to sixe and seuen in one word, which we at this day 
vse in our most ordinarie language: and which corruption hath bene 
occasioned chiefly by the peeuish affectation not of the Normas them 
selues, but of clerks and scholers or secretaries long since, wo not content 
with the vsual Normane or Saxon word, would conuert the very Latine and 
Greeke word into vulgar French, as to say innumerable for innombrable, 
reuocable, irreuocable, irradiation, depopulation &amp; such like, which are 
not naturall Normas nor yet French, but altered Latines, and without any 
imitation at all: which therefore were long time despised for inkehorne 
termes, and now be reputed the best &amp; most delicat of any other. Of 
which &amp; many other causes of corruption of our speach we haue in 
another place more amply discoursed, but by this meane we may at this day 
very well receiue the auncient feete <hi>metricall</hi> of the Greeks and 
Latines sauing those that be superflous as be all the feete aboue the 
<hi>trisillable</hi>, which the old Grammarians idly inuented and distinguisht 
by speciall names, whereas in deede the same do stand compounded with the 
inferiour feete, and therefore some of them were called by the names of 
<hi>didactilus</hi>, <hi>dispondeus</hi> and <hi>disiambus</hi>: all which feete as 
I say we may <pb n="98"/>
be allowed to vse with good discretion &amp; precise choise of wordes and 
with the fauorable approbation of readers, and so shall our plat in this one 
point be larger and much surmount that which <hi>Stanhurst</hi> first tooke in 
hand by his <hi>exameters dactilicke</hi> and <hi>spondaicke</hi> in the 
translation of <hi>Virgills Eneidos</hi>, and such as for a great number of 
them my stomacke can hardly digest for the ill shapen sound of many of his 
wordes <hi>polisillable</hi> and also his copulation of <hi>monosillables</hi>
supplying the quantitie of a <hi>trisillable</hi> to his intent. And right so in 
promoting this deuise of ours being (I feare me) much more nyce and 
affected, and therefore more misliked then his, we are to bespeake fauour, 
first of the delicate eares, then of the rigorous and seuere dispositions, 
lastly to craue pardon of the learned &amp; auncient makers in our vulgar, 
for if we should seeke in euery point to egall our speach with the Greeke and 
Latine in their <hi>metricall</hi> obseruations it could not possible be by vs 
perfourmed, because their sillables came to be timed some of them long, 
some of them short not by reason of any euident or apparent case in writing 
or sounde remaining vpon one more then another, for many times they 
shortned the sillable of sharpe accent and made long that of the flat, &amp; 
therefore we must needes say, it was in many of their wordes done by 
preelection in the first Poetes, not hauing regard altogether to the 
<hi>ortographie</hi>, and hardnesse or softnesse of a sillable, consonant, 
vowell or dipthong, but at their pleasure, or as it fell out: so as he that 
first put in a vers this word [<hi>Penelope</hi>] which might be <hi>Homer</hi>
or some other of his antiquitie, where he made [<hi>pe</hi>] in both places long 
and [<hi>ne</hi>] and [<hi>lo</hi>] short, he might haue made them otherwise and 
with as good reason, nothing in the world appearing that might moue them to 
make such (preelection) more in th'one sillable then in the other for <hi>pe</hi>. 
<hi>Ne</hi> and <hi>lo</hi> being sillables vocals be egally smooth and currant vpon 
the toung, and might beare aswel the long as the short time, but it pleased 
the Poet otherwise: so he that first shortned, <hi>ca</hi> in this word 
<hi>cano</hi>, and made long <hi>tro</hi> in <hi>troia</hi>, and <hi>o</hi> in 
<hi>oris</hi>, might haue aswell done the contrary, but because he that first 
put them into a verse, found as it is to be supposed a more sweetnesse in 
his owne eare to haue them so tymed, therefore all other Poets who 
followed, were fayne to doe the like, which made that <hi>Virgill</hi> who 
came many <pb n="99"/>
yeares after the first reception of wordes in their seuerall times, was 
driuen of necessitie to accept them in such quantities as they were left him 
and therefore said. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>arma vi rumque ca no tro ie qui primus ab oris</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Neither truely doe I see any other reason in that lawe (though in other rules 
of shortning and prolonging a sillable there may be reason) but that it 
stands vpon bare tradition. Such as the <hi>Cabalists</hi> auouch in their 
mysticall constructions Theologicall and others, saying that they receaued 
the same from hand to hand from the first parent <hi>Adam</hi>, 
<hi>Abraham</hi> and others, which I will giue them leaue alone both to say 
and beleeue for me, thinking rather that they haue bene the idle occupations, 
or perchaunce the malitious and craftie constructions of the 
<hi>Talmudists</hi>, and others of the Hebrue clerks to bring the world into 
admiration of their lawes and Religion. Now peraduenture with vs 
Englishmen it be somewhat too late to admit a new inuention of feete and 
times that our forefathers neuer vsed nor neuer obserued till this day, 
either in their measures or in their pronunciation, and perchaunce will 
seeme in vs a presumptuous part to attempt, considering also it would be 
hard to find many men to like of one mans choise in the limitation of times 
and quantities of words, with which not one, but euery eare is to be pleased 
and made a particular iudge, being most truly sayd, that a multitude or 
comminaltie is hard to please and easie to offend, and therefore I intend not 
to proceed any further in this curiositie then to shew some small subtillitie 
that any other hath not yet done, and not by imitation but by obseruation, nor 
to th'intent to haue it put in execution in our vulgar Poesie, but to be 
pleasantly scanned vpon, as are all nouelties so friuolous and ridiculous as 
it.

were of length, namely sixe sizes, whereas in deede, the metricall feete are 
but twelue in number, whereof foure only be of two times, and eight of three 
times, the rest compounds of the premised two sorts, euen as the 
Arithmeticall numbers aboue three are made of two and three. And if ye 
will know how many of these feete will be commodiously receiued with vs, I 
say all the whole twelue, for first for the foote <hi>spondeus</hi> of two long 
times ye haue these English wordes <hi>morning, midnight, mischaunce</hi>, 
and a number moe whose ortographie may direct your iudgement in this 
point: for your <hi>Trocheus</hi> of a long and short ye haue these wordes 
<hi>maner, broken, taken, bodie, member</hi>, and a great many moe if their 
last sillables abut not vpon the consonant in the beginning of another word, 
and in these whether they do abut or no <hi>wittie, dittie, sorrow, 
morrow</hi>, &amp; such like, which end in a vowell for your <hi>Iambus</hi> of 
a short and a long, ye haue these wordes [<hi>restore</hi>] [<hi>remorse</hi>] 
[<hi>desire</hi>] [<hi>endure</hi>] and a thousand besides. For your foote 
<hi>pirrichius</hi> or of two short silables ye haue these words [<hi>manie</hi>] 
[<hi>money</hi>] [<hi>penie</hi>] [<hi>silie</hi>] and others of that constitution or 
the like: for your feete of three times and first your <hi>dactill</hi>, ye haue 
these wordes &amp; a number moe <hi>patience, temperance, womanhead, 
iolitie, daungerous, duetifull</hi> &amp; others. For your <hi>mollosus</hi>, of 
all three long, ye haue a member of wordes also and specially most of your 
participles actiue, as <hi>persisting, despoiling, endenting</hi>, and such like 
in ortographie: for your <hi>anapestus</hi> of two short and a long ye haue 
these words but not many moe, as <hi>manifold, monilesse, remanent, 
holinesse</hi>. For your foote <hi>tribracchus</hi> of all three short, ye haue 
very few <hi>trisillables</hi>, because the sharpe accent will always make one 
of them long by pronunciation, which els would be by ortographie short as 
[<hi>merily</hi>] [<hi>minion</hi>] &amp; such like. For your foote 
<hi>bacchius</hi> of a short &amp; two long ye haue these and the like words 
<hi>trisillables</hi> [<hi>lamenting</hi>] [<hi>requesting</hi>] [<hi>renouncing</hi>] 
[<hi>repentance</hi>] [<hi>entering</hi>]. For your foote <hi>antibacchius</hi>, of 
two long and a short ye haue these wordes [<hi>forsaken</hi>] 
[<hi>impugned</hi>] and others many: for your <hi>amphimacer</hi> that is a long 
a short and a long ye haue these wordes and many moe [<hi>excellent</hi>] 
[<hi>iminent</hi>] and specially such as be propre names of persons or townes 
or other things and namely Welsh wordes: for your foote 
<hi>amphibracchus</hi>, of a short, a long and a short, ye haue these wordes 
and <pb n="101"/>
many like to these [<hi>resisted</hi>] [<hi>delightfull</hi>] [<hi>reprisall</hi>] 
[<hi>inaunter</hi>] [<hi>enamill</hi>] so as for want of English wordes if your 
eare be not to daintie and your rules to precise, ye neede not be without the 
<hi>metricall</hi> feete of the ancient Poets such as be most pertinent and 
not superfluous. This is (ye will perchaunce say) my singular opinion: then 
ye shall see how well I can maintaine it. First the quantitie of a word 
comes either by (preelection) without reason or force as hath bene alledged, 
and as the auncient Greekes and Latines did in many wordes, but not in all, 
or by (election) with reason as they did in some, and not a few. And a sound 
is drawen at length either by the infirmitie of the toung, because the word 
or sillable is of such letters as hangs long in the palate or lippes ere he will 
come forth, or because he is accented and tuned hier and sharper then 
another, whereby he somewhat obserueth the other sillables in the same 
word that be not accented so high, in both these cases we will establish our 
sillable long, contrariwise the shortning of a sillable is, when his sounde or 
accent happens to be heauy and flat, that is to fall away speedily, and as it 
were inaudible, or when he is made of such letters as be by nature slipper 
&amp; voluble and smoothly passe from the mouth. And the vowell is 
alwayes more easily deliuered then the consonant: and of consonants, the 
liquide more then the mute, &amp; a single consonant more then a double, 
and one more then twayne coupled together: all which points were obserued 
by the Greekes and Latines, and allowed for <hi>maximes</hi> in versifying. 
Now if ye will examine these four <hi>bisillables</hi> [<hi>remnant</hi>] 
[<hi>remaine</hi>] [<hi>render</hi>] [<hi>renet</hi>] for an example by which ye may 
make a generall rule, and ye shall finde, that they aunswere our first 
resolution. First in [<hi>remnant</hi>] [<hi>rem</hi>] bearing the sharpe accent 
and hauing his consonant abbut vpon another, soundes long. The sillable 
[<hi>nant</hi>] being written with two consonants must needs be accompted 
the same besides that [<hi>nant</hi>] by his Latin originall is long, viz. 
[<hi>remanens</hi>]. Take this word [<hi>remaine</hi>] because the last sillable 
beares the sharpe accent, he is long in the eare, and [<hi>re</hi>] being the 
first sillable, passing obscurely away with a flat accent is short, besides 
that [<hi>re</hi>] by his Latine originall and also by his ortographie is short. 
This word [<hi>render</hi>] bearing the sharp accent vpon [<hi>ren</hi>] makes it 
long, the sillable [<hi>der</hi>] falling <pb n="102"/>
away swiftly &amp; being also written with a single consonant or liquide is 
short and makes the <hi>trocheus</hi>. This word [<hi>renet</hi>] hauing both 
sillables sliding and slipper make the foote <hi>Pirrichius</hi>, because if he 
be truly vttered, he beares in maner no sharper accent vpon the one then the 
other sillable, but he in effect egall in time and tune, as is also the 
<hi>Spondeus</hi>. And because they be not written with any hard or harsh 
consonants, I do allow them both for short sillables, or to be vsed for 
common, according as their situation and place with other words shall be: 
and as I haue named to you but onely foure words for an example, so may ye 
find out by diligent obseruation foure hundred if ye will. But of all your 
words <hi>bisillables</hi> the most part naturally do make the foot 
<hi>Iambus</hi>, many the <hi>Trocheus</hi>, fewer the <hi>Spondeus</hi>, fewest 
of all the <hi>Pirrichius</hi>, because in him the sharpe accent (if ye follow 
the rules of your accent as we haue presupposed) doth make a litle oddes: 
and ye shall find verses made all of <hi>monosillables</hi>, and do very well, 
but lightly they be <hi>Iambickes</hi>, bycause for the more part the accent 
falles sharp vpon euery second word rather then contrariwise, as this of Sir 
<hi>Thomas Wiats</hi>.

</l>
               <p>And some verses where the sharpe accent falles vpon the first and third, and 
so make the verse wholly <hi>Trochaicke</hi>, as thus,

                  <hi>Worke not, no nor, wish thy friend or foes harme</hi>

               <p>And some verses make of <hi>monosillables</hi> and <hi>bisillables</hi>

               <head>Of your feet of three times, and first of the Dactil.</head>
               <p>Your feete of three times by prescription of the Latine Grammariens are of 
eight sundry proportions, for some notable difference appearing in euery 
sillable of three falling in a word of that size: but because aboue the 
<hi>antepenultima</hi> there was (among the Latines) none accent audible in 
any long word, therefore to deuise any foote of longer measure then of three 
times was to them but superfluous: because all aboue the number of three 
are but compounded of their inferiours. Omitting therefore to speake of 
these larger feete, we say that of all your feete of three times the 
<hi>Dactill</hi> is most vsuall and fit for our vulgar meeter, &amp; most 
agreeable to the eare, specially if ye ouerlade not your verse with too many 
of them but here and there enterlace a <hi>Iambus</hi> or some other foote of 
two times to giue him grauitie and stay, as in this <hi>quadrein Trimeter</hi>
or of three measures. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Render againe mie libertie</hi>
               </l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Conquerours use with lenitie</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where ye see euery verse is all of a measure, and yet vnegall in number of 
sillables: for the second verse is but of sixe sillables, where the rest are of 
eight. But the reason is for that in three of the same verses are two 
<hi>Dactils</hi> a peece, which abridge two sillables in euery verse: and so 
maketh the longest euen with the shortest. Ye may note besides by the first 
verse, how much better some <hi>bisillable</hi> becommeth to peece out an 
other longer foote then another word doth: for in place of [<hi>render</hi>] if 
ye had sayd [<hi>restore</hi>] it had marred the <hi>Dactil</hi>, and of necessitie 
driuen him out at length to be a verse <hi>Iambic</hi> of foure feet, because 
[<hi>render</hi>] is naturally a <hi>Trocheus</hi> and makes the first two times 
of a <hi>dactil</hi>. [<hi>Restore</hi>] is naturally a <hi>labus</hi>, &amp; in this 
place could not possibly haue made a pleasant <hi>dactil</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Now againe if ye will say to me that these two words [<hi>libertie</hi>] and 
[<hi>conqueror</hi>] be not precise <hi>Dactils</hi> by the Latine rule. So much 
will I confesse to, but since they go currant inough vpon the tongue, and be 
so vsually pronounced, they may passe wel inough for <hi>Dactils</hi> in our 
vulgar meeters, &amp; that is inough for me, seeking but to fashion an art, 
&amp; not to finish it: which time only &amp; custom haue authoritie to do, 
specially in all cases of language as the Poet hath wittily remembred in this 
verse <hi>-si volet usus</hi>

               </p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Quem penes arbitrium est &amp; vis &amp; norma loquendi</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The Earle of Surrey vpon the death of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> made among 
other this verse <hi>Pentameter</hi> and of ten sillables, 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>What hole graue (alas) what sepulcher</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>

but if I had had the making of him, he should haue bene of eleuen sillables 
and kept his measure of fiue still, and would so haue runne more pleasantly 
a great deale: for as he is now, though he be euen he seemes odde and 
defectiue, for not well obseruing the natural accent of euery word, and this 
would haue bene soone holpen by inserting one <hi>monosillable</hi> in the 
middle of the verse, and drawing another sillable in the beginning into a 
<hi>Dactil</hi>, this word [<hi>holy</hi>] being a good [<hi>Pirrichius</hi>] &amp; 
very well seruing the turne, thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>What holie graue a las what fit sepulcher</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Which verse if ye peruse throughout ye shall find him after the first 
<hi>dactil</hi> all <hi>Trochaick</hi> &amp; not <hi>Iambic</hi>, nor of any other 
foot of two <pb n="105"/>
times. But perchance if ye would seeme yet more curious, in place of these 
foure <hi>Trocheus</hi> ye might induce other feete of three times, as to make 
the three sillables next following the <hi>dactil</hi>, the foote 
[<hi>amphimacer</hi>] the last word [<hi>Sepulcher</hi>] the foote 
[<hi>amphibracus</hi>] leauing the other midle word for a [<hi>Iambus</hi>] thus. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What holie graue a las what fit sepulcher</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>If ye aske me further why I make [<hi>what</hi>] first long &amp; after short 
in one verse, to that I satisfied you before, that it is by reason of his accent 
sharpe in one place and flat in another, being a common <hi>monosillable</hi>, 
that is, apt to receiue either accent, &amp; so in the first place receiuing 
aptly the sharpe accent he is made long: afterward receiuing the flat accent 
more aptly then the sharpe, because the sillable precedent [<hi>las</hi>] 
vtterly distaines him, he is made short &amp; not long &amp; that with very 
good melodie, but to haue giuen him the sharpe accent &amp; plucked it from 
the sillable [<hi>las</hi>] it had bene to any mans eare a great discord: for 
euermore this word [<hi>alas</hi>] is accepted vpon the last, &amp; that 
lowdly &amp; notoriously as appeareth by all our exclamations vsed vnder 
that terme. The same Earle of Surrey &amp; Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> the 
first reformers &amp; polishers of our vulgar Poesie much affecting the 
stile and measures of the Italian <hi>Petrarcha</hi>, vased the foote 
<hi>dactil</hi> very often but not many in one verse, as in these,

vertue of the figure <hi>Syneresis</hi> which I thinke was neuer their meaning, 
nor in deede would haue bred any pleasure, to the eare, but hindred the 
flowing of the verse. Howsoeuer ye take it the <hi>dactil</hi> is commendable 
inough in our vulgar meetres, but most plausible of all when he is sounded 
vpon the stage, as in these comicall verses shewing how well it becommeth 
all noble men and great personages to be temperat and modest, yea more 
then any meaner man, thus.

short a long and a short by this word [<hi>remember</hi>] <pb n="107"/>
if a vowell follow. The foote [<hi>Tribrachus</hi>] of three short 
times is very hard to be made by any of our <hi>trisillables</hi> vnles they be 
compounded of the smoothest sort of consonants or sillables vocals, or of 
three smooth <hi>monosillables</hi>, or of some peece of a long 
<hi>polysillable</hi> &amp; after that sort we may with wresting of words 
shape the foot [<hi>Tribrachus</hi>] rather by vsurpation then by rule, which 
neuertheles is allowed in euery primitiue arte &amp; inuention: &amp; so it 
was by the Greekes and Latines in their first versifying, as if a rule should 
be set downe that from henceforth these words should be counted al 
<hi>Tribrachus</hi> [<hi>enemie</hi>] <hi>remedie</hi>] <hi>selines</hi>] 
<hi>moniles</hi>] <hi>peniles</hi>] <hi>cruellie</hi>] &amp; such like, or a peece of 
this long word [<hi>recouerable</hi>] <hi>innumerable readilie</hi>] and others. 
Of all which manner of apt wordes to make these stranger feet of three 
times which go not so currant with our eare as the <hi>dactil</hi>, the maker 
should haue a good iudgement to which serue most fitly for euery foote, or 
else he should haue alwaies a little calender of them apart to vse readily 
when he shall neede them. but because in very truth I thinke them but vaine 
&amp; superstitious obseruations nothing at all furthering the pleasant 
melody of our English meeter, I leaue to speake any more of them and rather 
wish the continuance of our old maner of Poesie, scanning our verse by 
sillables rather than by feete, and vsing most commonly the word 
<hi>Iambique</hi> &amp; sometime the <hi>Trochaike</hi> which ye shall 
discerne by their accents, and now and then a <hi>dactill</hi> keeping 
precisely our symphony or rime without any other mincing measures, which 
an idle inuentiue head could easily deuise, as the former examples teach.

               <p>The Greekes and Latines vsed verses in the odde sillable of two sortes, 
which they called <hi>Catalecticke</hi> and <hi>Acatalecticke</hi>, that is odde 
vnder and odde ouer the iust measure of their verse, &amp; we in our vulgar 
finde many of the like, and specially in the rimes of Sir Thomas Wiat, 
strained perchaunce out of their originall, made first by <hi>Francis 
Patrarcha</hi>: as these 

</p>
               <l>

                  <hi>And I of teares, and they are full of fountaines</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where in your first second and fourth verse, ye may find a sillable 
superfluous, and though in the first ye will seeme to helpe it, by drawing 
these three sillables, [<hi>im me su</hi>] into a <hi>dactil</hi>, in the rest it can 
not be so excused, wherefore we must thinke he did it of purpose, by the 
odde sillable to giue greater grace to his meetre, and we finde in our old 
rimes, this odde sillable, sometimes placed in the beginning and sometimes 
in the middle of a verse, and is allowed to go alone &amp; to hang to any 
other sillable. But this odde sillable in our meetres is not the halfe foote as 
the Greekes and Latines vsed him in their verses, and called such measure 
<hi>pentimimeris</hi> and <hi>eptamimeris</hi>, but rather is that, which they 
called the <hi>catalectik</hi> or maymed verse. Their <hi>hemmimeris</hi> or 
halfe foote serued not by license Poeticall or necessitie of words, but to 
bewtifie and exornate the verse by placing one such halfe foote in the middle 
<hi>Cesure</hi>, &amp; one other in the end of the verse, as they vsed all their 
<hi>pentameters elegiack</hi>: and not by coupling them together, but by 
accompt to make their verse of a iust measure and not defectiue or 
superflous: our odde sillable is not altogether of that nature, but is in a 
maner drownd and supprest by the flat accent, and shrinks away as it were 
inaudible and by that meane the odde verse comes almost to be an euen in 
euery mans hearing. The halfe foote of the auncients was reserued 
purposely to an vse, and therefore they gaue such odde sillable, wheresoeuer 
he fell the sharper accent, and made by him a notorious pause as in this 
<hi>pentameter</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nil mi hi rescribas attamen ipse ve ni</hi>.

and his time will appeare the selfe same still and ought not to be altered by

ech sillable retayning still his former quantities. And alwaies ye must 
haue regard to the sweetenes of the meetre, so as if your word 
<hi>polysillable</hi> would not sound pleasantly whole, ye should for the 
nonce breake him, which ye may easily doo by inserting here and there one 
<hi>monosillable</hi> among your <hi>polysillables</hi>, or by chaunging your 
word into another place then where he soundes vnpleasantly, and by 
breaking, turne a <hi>trocheus</hi> to a <hi>iambus</hi>, or contrariwise: as 
thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hollow valleis under hiest mountaines</hi>

</l>
               <p>These verses be <hi>trockaik</hi>, and in mine eare not so sweete and 
harmonicall as the <hi>iambique</hi>, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The hollowst vals lie under hiest mountaines</hi>

</l>
               <p>All which verses bee now become <hi>iambicque</hi> by breaking the first 
<hi>bisillables</hi>, and yet alters not their quantities though the feete be 
altered: and thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Restlesse is the heart in his desires</hi>
               </l>

                  <hi>Rauing after that reason doth denie</hi>.

                  <hi>Ay rauing after that reason doth it deny</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And following this obseruation your meetres being builded with 
<hi>polysillables</hi> will fall diuersly out, that is some to be 
<hi>spondaick</hi>, some <hi>iambick</hi>, others <hi>dactilick</hi>, others 
<hi>trockaick</hi>, and of one mingled with another, as in this verse. 

</p>

</l>
               <p>And as Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> song in a verse wholly <hi>trochaick</hi>, 
because the wordes do best shape to that foote by their naturall accent, 
thus, 

<q>

                        <hi>Farewell loue and all thie lawes for euer</hi>. </l>

               </p>
               <p>And in this ditty of th'Erle of Surries, passing sweete and harmonicall: all 
be <hi>Iambick</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>

               </l>

                  <hi>Beare witnesse of my wofull smart</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Which beying disposed otherwise or not broken, would proue all 
<hi>trochaick</hi>, but nothing pleasant. 


</p>
               <p>Now furthermore ye are to note, that al your <hi>monosyllables</hi> may 
receiue the sharp accent, but not so aptly one as another, as in this verse 
where they serue well to make him <hi>iambique</hi>, but not <hi>trochaick</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi> God graunt this peace may long indure</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where the sharpe accent falles more tunably vpon [<hi>graunt</hi>] 
[<hi>peace</hi>] [<hi>long</hi>] [<hi>dure</hi>] then it would by conuersion, as to 
accent them thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>God graunt — this peace — may long — endure</hi>, 

</l>
               <p>And yet if ye will aske me the reason, I can not tell it, but that it shapes so 
to myne eare, and as I thinke to euery other mans. And in this meeter where 
ye haue whole words <hi>bisillable vnbroken</hi>, that maintaine (by reason of 
their accent) sundry feete, yet going one with another be very 
<hi>harmonicall</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Where ye see one to be a <hi>trocheus</hi> another the <hi>iambus</hi>, and so 
entermingled not by election but by constraint of their seuerall accents, 
which ought not to be altred, yet comes it to passe that many times ye must 
of necessitie alter the accent of a sillable, and put him from his naturall 
place, and then one sillable, of a word <hi>polysillable</hi>, or one word 
<hi>monosillable</hi>, will abide to be made sometimes long, sometimes 
short, as in this <hi>quadreyne</hi> of ours playd in a mery moode. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Geue me mine owne and when I do desire</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Geue others theirs, and nothing that is mine</hi>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor giue me that, wherto all men aspire</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then neither gold, nor faire women nor wine</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where in your first these two words [<hi>giue</hi>] and [<hi>me</hi>] are 
accented one high th'other low, in the third verse the same words are 
accented contrary, and the reason of this exchange is manifest, because the 
maker playes with these two clauses of sundry relations [<hi>giue me</hi>] 
and [<hi>giue others</hi>] so as the <hi>monosillable</hi> [<hi>me</hi>] being 
respectiue to the word [<hi>others</hi>] and inferring a subtiltie or wittie 
implication, ought not to haue the same accent, as when he hath no such 
respect, as in this <hi>distik</hi> of ours. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Proue me (Madame) ere ye reproue</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Meeke minds should excuse not accuse</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>In which verse ye see this word [<hi>reprooue</hi>] the sillable [<hi>prooue</hi>] 
alters his sharpe accent into a flat, for naturally it is long in all his singles 
and compoundes [<hi>reprooue</hi>] [<hi>approue</hi>] [<hi>disprooue</hi>] &amp; so 
is the sillable [<hi>cuse</hi>] in [<hi>excuse</hi>] [<hi>accuse</hi>] [<hi>recuse</hi>] 
yet in these verses by reason one of them doth as it were nicke another, and 
haue a certaine extraordinary sence with all, it behoueth to remoue the 
sharpe accents from whence they are most naturall, to place them where the 
nicke may be more expresly discouered, and therefore in this verse where no 
such implication is, nor no relation it is otherwise, as thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>If ye reproue my constancie</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I will excuse you curtesly</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>For in this word [<hi>reprooue</hi>] because there is no extraordinary sence to 
be inferred, he keepeth his sharpe accent vpon the sillable [<hi>prooue</hi>] 
but in the former verses because they seeme to encounter ech other they do 
thereby merite an audible and pleasant alteration of their accents in those 
sillables that cause the subtiltie. Of these maner of nicetees ye shal finde 
in many places of our booke, but specially where we treate of ornament, 
vnto which we referre you, sauing that we thought good to set down one 
example more to solace your mindes with mirth after all these scholasticall 
preceptes, which can not but bring with them (specially to Courtiers) much 
tediousnesse, and so to end. In our Comedie intituled <hi>Ginecocratia</hi>: 
the king was supposed to be a person very amorous and effeminate, and 
therefore most ruled his ordinary affaires by the <pb n="112"/>
aduise of women either for the loue he bare to their persons or liking he had 
to their pleasant ready witts and vtterance. Comes me to the Court one 
<hi>Polemon</hi> an honest plaine man of the country, but rich: and hauing a 
suite to the king, met by chaunce with one <hi>Philino</hi>, a louer of wine and 
a merry companion in Court, and praied him in that he was a stranger that he 
would vouchsafe to tell him which way he were best to worke to get his 
suite, and who were most in credit and fauour about the king, that he might 
seeke to them to furder his attempt. <hi>Philino</hi> perceyuing the 
plainnesse of the man, and that there would be some good done with him, 
told <hi>Polemon</hi> that if he would well consider him for his labor he 
would bring him where he should know the truth of all his demaundes by the 
sentence of the Oracle. <hi>Polemon</hi> gaue him twentie crownes, 
<hi>Philino</hi> brings him into a place where behind and arras cloth hee 
himselfe spake in manner of an Oracle in these meeters, for so did all the 
Sybils and sothsaiers in old time giue their answers. 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Your best way to worke - and marke my words well,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Not money: nor many,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Nor any: but any,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Not weemen, but weemen beare the bell</hi>. </l>
                  </q>

                  <hi>Polemon</hi> wist not what to make of this doubtfull speach, &amp; not 
being lawfull to importune the oracle more then once in one matter, 
conceyed in his head the pleasanter construction, and stacke to it: and 
hauing at home a fayer yong damsell of eighteene yeares old to his daughter, 
that could very well behaue her selfe in countenance &amp; also in her 
language, apparelles her as gay as he could, and brought her to the Court, 
where <hi>Philino</hi> harkning daily after the euent of this matter, met him, 
and recommended his daughter to the Lords, who perceiuing her great beauty 
and other good parts, brought her to the King, to whom she exhibited her 
fathers supplication, and found so great fauour in his eye, as without any 
long delay she obtained her sute at his hands. <hi>Polemon</hi> by the diligent 
solliciting of his daughter, wanne his purpose: <hi>Philino</hi> gat a good 
reward and vsed the matter so, as howsoeuer the oracle had bene construed, 
he could not haue receiued blame nor discredit by the successe, for euery 
waies it would haue proued true, whether <hi>Polemons</hi> daughter had 
obtayned the sute, or not obtained it. <pb n="113"/>
And the subtiltie lay in the accent and Ortographie of these two wordes 
[<hi>any</hi>] and [<hi>weemen</hi>] for [<hi>any</hi>] being deuided sounds [<hi>a 
nie</hi>] or neere person to the king: and [<hi>weemen</hi>] being diuided 
soundes <hi>wee men</hi>], and not [<hi>weemen</hi>] and so by this meane 
<hi>Philino</hi> serued all turnes and shifted himselfe from blame, not vnlike 
the tale of the Rattlemouse who in the warres proclaimed betweene the 
foure footed beasts, and the birdes, beyng sent for by the Lyon to beat his 
musters, excused himselfe for that he was a soule and flew with winges: 
and beyng sent for by the Eagle to serue him, sayd that he was a foure footed 
beast, and by that craftie cauill escaped the danger of the warres, and 
shunned the seruice of both Princes. And euer since sate at home by the 
fires side, eating vp the poore husbandmans baken, half lost for lacke of a 
good huswifes looking too.

Poesie: so is there yet requisite to the perfection of this arte, another

conueyance, disguising it no litle from the ordinary and accustomed: 
neuerthelesse making it nothing the more vnseemely or misbecomming, but 
rather decenter and more agreable to any ciuill eare and vnderstanding. And

handled must needes yeld it much more bewtie and commendation. This 
ornament we speake of is giuen to it by figures and figuratiue speaches, 
which be the flowers as it were and coulours that a Poet setteth vpon his 
language by arte, as the embroderer doth his stone and perle, or passements 
of gold vpon the stuffe of a Princely garment, or as th'excellent painter 
bestoweth the rich Orient coulours vpon his table of pourtraite: so 
neuerthelesse as if the same coulours in our arte of Poesie (as well as in 
those other mechanicall artes) be not well tempered, or not well layd, or be 
vsed in excesse, or neuer so litle disordered or misplaced, they not onely 
giue it no maner of grace at all, but rather do disfigure the stuffe and spill 
the whole workmanship taking away all bewtie and good liking from it, no 
lesse then if the crimson tainte, which should be laid vpon a Ladies lips, or 
right in the center of her cheekes should by some ouersight or mishap be 
applied to her forhead or chinne, it would make (ye would say) but a very 
ridiculous bewtie, wherfore the chief prayse and cunning of our Poet is in 
the discreet vsing of his figures, as the skilfull painters is in the good 
conueyance of his coulours and shadowing traits of his pensill, with a 
delectable varietie, by all measure and iust proportion, and in places most 
aptly to be bestowed.

               <head>How our writing and speaches publike ought to be figuratiue, and if they be not doe greatly disgrace the cause and purpose of the speaker and writer.</head>
               <p>Bvt as it hath bene alwayes reputed a great fault to vse figuratiue speaches 
foolishly and indiscretly, so is it esteemed no lesse an imperfection in mans 
vtterance, to haue none vse of figure at all, specially in our writing and 
speaches publike, making them but as our ordinary talke, then which nothing 
can be more vnsauourie and farre from all ciuilitie. I remember in the first 
yeare of Queenes Maries raigne a Knight of Yorkshire was chosen speaker of 
the Parliament, a good gentleman and wise, in the affaires of his shire, and 
not vnlearned in the lawes of the Realme, but as well for some lack of his 
teeth, as for want of language nothing <pb n="116"/>
well spoken, which at that time and businesse was most behooffull for 
him to haue bene: this man after he had made his Oration to the Queene; 
which ye know is of course to be done at the first assembly of both houses; 
a bencher of the Temple both well learned and very eloquent, returning from 
the Parliament house asked another gentleman his frend how he liked M. 
Speakers Oration: many quoth th'other, me thinks I heard not a better 
alehouse tale told this seuen yeares. This happened because the good old 
Knight made no difference betweene an Oration or publike speach to be 
deliuered to th'eare of a Princes Maiestie and state of a Realme, then he 
would haue done of an ordinary tale to be told at his table in the contrey, 
wherein all men know the oddes is very great. And though graue and wise 
counsellours in their consultations doe not vse much superfluous eloquence, 
and also in their iudiciall hearings do much mislike all scholasticall 
rhetoricks: yet in such a case as it may be (and as this Parliament was) if 
the Lord Chancelour of England or Archibishop of Canterbury himselfe were 
to speake, he ought to doe it cunningly and eloquently, which can not be 
without the vse of figures: and neuerthelesse none impeachment or blemish 
to the grauitie of their persons or of the cause: wherein I report me to them 
that knew Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon</hi> Lord keeper of the great Seale, or now 
Lord Treasorer of England, and haue bene conuersant with their speaches 
made in the Parliament house &amp; Starrechamber. From whose lippes I 
haue seene to proceede more graue and naturall eloquence, then from all the 
Oratours of Oxford or Cambridge, but all is as it is handled, and maketh no 
matter whether the same eloquence be naturall to them or artificiall 
(though I thinke rather naturall) yet were they knowen to be learned and not 
vnskilfull of th'arte, when they were yonger men: and as learning and arte 
teacheth a scholar to speake, so doeth it also teach a counsellour, and 
aswell an old man as a yong, and a man in authoritie, aswell as a priuate 
person, and a pleader aswell as a preacher, euery man after his sort and 
calling as best becommeth: and that speach which becommeth one, doth not 
become another, for maners of speaches, some serue to work in excesse, 
some in mediocritie, some to graue purposes, some to light, some to be 
short and <pb n="117"/>
brief, some to be long, some to stirre vp affections, some to pacifie and 
appease them, and these common despisers of good vtterance, which resteth 
altogether in figuratiue speaches, being well vsed whether it come by 
nature or by arte or by exercise, they be but certaine grosse ignorance of 
whom it is truly spoken <hi>scientia non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem</hi>. 
I haue come to the Lord Keeper Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon</hi>, &amp; found him 
fitting in his gallery alone with the works of <hi>Quintilian</hi> before him, in 
deede he was a most eloquent man, and of rare learning and wisedome, as 
euer I knew England to breed, and one that ioyed as much in learned men and 
men of good witts. A Knight of the Queenes priuie chamber, once intreated a 
noble woman of the Court, being in great fauour about her Maiestie (to 
th'intent to remoue her from a certaine displeasure, which by sinister 
opinion she had conceiued against a gentleman his friend) that it would 
please her to heare him speake in his own cause, &amp; not to condemne him 
vpon his aduersaries report: God forbid said she, he is to wise for me to 
talke with, let him goe and satisfie such a man naming him: why quoth the 
Knight againe, had our Ladyship rather heare a man talke like a foole or like 
a wise man? This was because the Lady was a litle peruerse, and not 
disposed to reforme her selfe by hearing reason, which none other can so 
well beate into the ignorant head, as the well spoken and eloquent man. And 
because I am so farre waded into this discourse of eloquence and figuratiue 
speaches, I will tell you what hapned on a time my selfe being present when 
certaine Doctours of the ciuil law were heard in a litigious cause betwixt a 
man and his wife: before a great Magistrat who (as they can tell that knew 
him) was a man very well learned and graue, but somewhat fowre, and of no 
plausible vtterance: the gentlemans chaunce, was to say: my Lord the 
simple woman is not so much to blame as her lewde abbettours, who by 
violent perswasions haue lead her into this wilfulnesse. Quoth the iudge, 
what neede such eloquent termes in this place, the gentleman replied, doth 
your Lordship mislike the terme, [<hi>violent</hi>] &amp; me thinkes I speake 
it to great purpose: for I am sure she would neuer haue done it, but by force 
of perswasion: &amp; if perswasions were not very violent to the minde of 
man it could not haue wrought so strange an effect as we read that it did 
once in Ae <pb n="118"/>
gypt, &amp; would haue told the whole tale at large, if the Magistrate had 
not passed it ouer very pleasantly. Now to tell you the whole matter as the 
gentleman intended, thus it was. There came into Aegypt a notable Oratour, 
whose name was <hi>Hegesias</hi> who inueyed so much against the 
incommodities of this transitory life, &amp; so highly commended death the 
dispatcher of all euils; as a great number of his hearers destroyed 
themselues, some with weapon, some with poyson, others by drowning and 
hanging themselues to be rid out of this vale of misery, in so much as it was 
feared least many moe of the people would haue miscaried by occasion of 
his perswasions, if king <hi>Ptolome</hi> had not made a publicke 
proclamation, that the Oratour should auoyde the countrey, and no more be 
allowed to speake in any matter. Whether now perswasions, may not be said 
violent and forcible to simple myndes in speciall, I referre it to all mens 
iudgements that heare the story. At least waies, I finde this opinion, 
confirmed by a pretie deuise or embleme that <hi>Lucianus</hi> alleageth he 
saw in the pourtrait of <hi>Hercules</hi> within the Citie of Marseills in 
Prouence: where they had figured a lustie old man with a long chayne tyed 
by one end at his tong, by the other end at the peoples eares, who stood a 
farre of and seemed to be drawen to him by the force of that chayne fastned 
to his tong, as who would say, by force of his perswasions. And to shew 
more plainly that eloquence is of great force (and not as many men thinke 
amisse) the propertie and gift of yong men onely, but rather of old men, and 
a thing which better becommeth hory haires then beardlesse boyes, they 
seeme to ground it vpon this reason: age (say they and most truly) beings 
experience, experience bringeth wisedome, long life yeldes long vse and 
much exercise of speach, exercise and custome with wisedome, make an 
assured and volluble vtterance: so is ti that old men more then any other 
sort speake most grauely, wisely, assuredly, and plausibly, which partes are 
all that can be required in perfite eloquence, and so in all deliberations of 
importance where counsellours are allowed freely to opyne &amp; shew 
their conceits, good perswasion is no lesse requisite then speach it selfe: 
for in great purposes to speake and not be able or likely to perswade, is a 
vayne thing: now let vs returne backe to say more of this Poeticall 
ornament.

               <head>How ornament Poeticall is of two sortes according to the double vertue and efficacie of figures.</head>
               <p>This ornament then is of two sortes, one to satisfie &amp; delight th'eare 
onely by a goodly outward shew se vpon the matter with wordes, and 
speaches smothly and tunably running: another by certaine intendments or 
sence of such wordes &amp; speaches inwardly working a stirre to the 
mynde: that first qualitie the Greeks called <hi>Enargia</hi>, of this word 
<hi>argos</hi>, because it geueth a glorious lustre and light. This latter they 
called <hi>Energia</hi> of <hi>ergon</hi>, because it wrought with a strong and 
vertuous operation; and figure breedeth them both, some seruing to giue 
glosse onely to a language, some to geue it efficacie by sence, and so by that 
meanes some of them serue th'eare onely, some serue the conceit onely and 
not th'eare: there be of them also that serue both turnes as common 
seruitours appointed for th'one and th'other purpose, which shalbe hereafter 
spoken of in place: but because we haue alleaged before that ornament is 
but the good or rather bewtifull habite of language and stile, and figuratiue 
speaches the instrument wherewith we burnish our language fashioning it to 
this or that measure and proportion, whence finally resulteth a long and 
continuall phrase or maner of writing or speach, which we call by the name 
of <hi>stile</hi>: we wil first speake of language, then of stile, lastly of 
figure, and declare their vertue and differences, and also their vse and best 
application, &amp; what portion in exornation euery of them bringeth to the 
bewtifying of this Arte.

               <head>Of Language.</head>
               <p>Speach is not naturall to man sauing for his onely habilitie to speake, and 
that he is by kinde apt to vtter all his conceits with sounds and voyces 
diuersified many maner of wayes, by meanes of the many &amp; fit 
instruments he hath by nature to that purpose, as a broad and voluble tong, 
thinne and mouable lippes, teeth euen and not shagged, thick ranged, a round 
vaulted pallate, and a long throte, besides and excellent capacitie of wit 
that maketh him more disciplinable and imitatiue then any other creature: 
then as to the <pb n="120"/>
forme and action of his speach, it commeth to him by arte &amp; teaching, 
and by vse or exercise. But after a speach is fully fashioned to the common 
vnderstanding, &amp; accepted by consent of a whole countrey &amp; 
nation, it is called a language, &amp; receaueth none allowed alteration, but 
by extraordinary occasions by little &amp; little, as it were insensibly 
bringing in of many corruptions that creepe along with the time: of all 
which matters, we haue more largely spoken in our bookes of the originals 
and pedigree of the English tong. Then when I say language, I meane the 
speach wherein the Poet or maker writeth be it Greek or Latine or as our 
case is the vulgar English, &amp; when it is peculiar vnto a countrey it is 
called the mother speach of that people: the Greekes terme it <hi>Idioma</hi>: 
so is ours at this day the Norman English. Before the Conquest of the 
Normans it was the Anglesaxon, and before that the British, which as some 
will, is at this day, the Walsh, or as others affirme the Cornish: I for my 
part thinke neither of both, as they be now spoken and pronounced. This part 
in our maker or Poet must be heedyly looked vnto, that it be naturall, pure, 
and the most vsuall of all his countrey: and for the same purpose rather 
that which is spoken in the kings Court, or in the good townes and Cities 
within the land, then in the marches and frontiers, or in port townes, where 
straungers haunt for traffike sake, or yet in Vniuersities where Scholers 
vse much peeuish affectation of words out of the primatiue languages, or 
finally, in any vplandish village or corner of a Realme, where is no resort 
but of poore rusticall or vnciuill people: neither shall he follow the speach 
of a craftes man or carter, or other of the inferiour sort, though he be 
inhabitant or bred in the best town and Citie in this Realme, for such 
persons do abuse good speaches by strange accents or illshapen soundes, and 
false ortographie. But he shall follow generally the better brought vp sort, 
such as the Greekes call [<hi>charientes</hi>] men ciuill and graciously 
behauoured and bred. Our maker therfore at these dayes shall not follow 
<hi>Piers plowman</hi> nor <hi>Gower</hi> nor <hi>Lydgate</hi> nor yet 
<hi>Chaucer</hi>, for their language is now out of vse with vs: neither shall 
he take the termes of Northern-men, such as they vse in dayly talke, 
whether they be noble men or gentlemen, or of their best clarkes all is a 
matter: nor in effect any speach vsed beyond the <pb n="121"/>
riuer of Trent, though no man can deny but that theirs is the purer English 
Saxon at this day, yet it is not so Courtly nor so currant as our Southerne 
English is, no more is the far Westerne mans speach: ye shall therfore take 
the vsuall speach of the Court, and that of London and the shires lying about 
London within lx. myles, and not much aboue. I say not this but that in euery 
shyre of England there be gentlemen and others that speake but specially 
write as good Southerne as we of Middlesex or Surrey do, but not the 
common people of euery shire, to whom the gentlemen, and also their 
learned clarkes do for the most part condescend, but herein we are already 
ruled by th'English Dictionaries and other bookes written by learned men, 
and therefore it needeth none other direction in that behalfe. Albeit 
peraduenture some small admonition be not impertinent, for we finde in our 
English writers many wordes and speaches amendable, &amp; ye shall see in 
some many inkhorne termes so ill affected brought in by men of learning as 
preachers and schoolemasters: and many straunge termes of other 
languages by Secretaries and Marchaunts and trauailours, and many darke 
wordes and not vsuall nor well sounding, though they be dayly spoken in 
Court. Wherefore great heed must be taken by our maker in this point that 
his choise be good. And peraduenture the writer hereof be in that behalfe no 
lesse faultie then any other, vsing many straunge and vnaccustomed wordes 
and borrowed from other languages: and in that respect him selfe no meete 
Magistrate to reforme the same errours in any other person, but since he is 
not vnwilling to acknowledge his owne fault, and can the better tell how to 
amend it, he may seeme a more excusable correctour of other mens: he 
intendeth therefore for an indifferent way and vniuersall benefite to taxe 
him selfe first and before any others. 


</p>
               <p>These be wordes vsed by th'author in this present treatise, 
<hi>scientificke</hi>, but with some reason, for it aunswereth the word 
<hi>mechanicall</hi>, which no other word could haue done so properly, for 
when hee spake of all artificers which rest either in science or in handy 
craft, it followed necessarilie that <hi>scientifique</hi> should be coupled 
with <hi>mechanicall</hi>: or els neither of both to haue bene allowed, but in 
their places: a man of science liberall, and a handicrafts man, which <pb n="122"/>
had not bene so cleanly a speech as the other <hi>Maior-domo</hi>: in truth 
this word is borrowed of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi>, and 
therefore new and not vsuall, but to them that are acquainted with the 
affaires of Court: and so for his iolly magnificence (as this case is) may be 
accepted among Courtiers, for whom this is specially written. A man might 
haue said in steade of <hi>Maior-domo</hi>, the French word (<hi>maistre 
d'hostell</hi> but ilfauouredly, or the right English word (<hi>Lord 
Steward</hi>). But me thinks for my owne opinion this word <hi>Maior-domo</hi>
though he be borrowed, is more acceptable than any of the rest, 
other man may iudge otherwise. <hi>Politien</hi> this word also is receiued 
from the Frenchmen, but at this day vsuall in Court and with all good 
Secretaries: and cannot finde an English word to match him, for to haue said 
a man politique, had not bene so wel: bicause in trueth that had bene no 
more than to haue said a ciuil person. <hi>Politien</hi> is rather a surueyour 
of ciuilitie than ciuil, &amp; a publique minister or Counseller in the state. 
Ye haue also this worde <hi>Conduict</hi>, a French word, but well allowed of 
vs, and long since vsuall, it soundes somewhat more that this word (leading) 
for it is applied onely to the leading of a Captaine, and not as a little boy 
should leade a blinde man, therefore more proper to the case when he saide, 
<hi>conduict</hi> of whole armies: ye finde also this word <hi>Idiome</hi>, 
taken from the Greekes, yet seruing aptly, when a man wanteth to expresse 
so much vnles it be in two words, which surplussage to auoide, we are 
allowed to draw in other words single, and asmuch significatiue: this word 
<hi>significatiue</hi> is borrowed of the Latine and French, but to vs brought 
in first by some Noble-mans Secretarie, as I thinke, yet doth so well serue 
the turne, as it could not now be spared: and many more like vsurped Latine 
and French words: as, <hi>Methode, methodicall, placation, function, 
assubtiling, refining, compendious, prolixe, figuratiue, inueigle</hi>. A 
terme borrowed of our common Lawyers. <hi>impression</hi>, also a new 
terme, but well expressing the matter, and more than our English word. 
These words, <hi>Numerous, numerositee, metricall, harmonicall</hi>, but they 
cannot be refused, specially in this place for description of the arte. Also 
ye finde these words, <hi>penetrate, penetrable, indignitie</hi>, which I 
cannot see how we may speare the, whatsoeuer fault wee finde with Ink-horne 
ermes: for our speach wanteth wordes to <pb n="123"/>
such sence so well to be vsed: yet in steade of <hi>indignitie</hi>, ye haue 
vnworthinesse: and for <hi>penetrate</hi>, we may say <hi>peerce</hi>, and that 
a French terme also, or <hi>broche</hi>, or enter into with violence, but not so 
well sounding as <hi>penetrate</hi>. Item, <hi>sauage</hi>, for wilde: 
<hi>obscure</hi>, for darke. Item these words, <hi>declination, delineation, 
dimention</hi>, are scholasticall termes in deede, and yet very proper. But 
peraduenture (&amp; I could bring a reason for it) many other like words 
borrowed out of the Latine and French, were not so well to be allowed by vs, 
as these words, <hi>audacious</hi>, for bold: <hi>facunditie</hi>, for eloquence: 
<hi>egregious</hi>, for great or notable: <hi>implete</hi>, for replenished: 
<hi>attemptat</hi>, for attempt: <hi>compatible</hi>, for agreeable in nature, 
and many more. But herein the noble Poet <hi>Horace</hi> hath said inough to 
satisfie vs in all these few verses.

               <head>Of Stile.</head>
               <p>Stile is a constant &amp; continuall phrase or tenour of speaking and 
writing, extending to the whole tale or processe of the poeme or historie, 
and not properly to any peece or member of a tale: but is of words speeches 
and sentences together, a certaine contriued forme and qualitie, many times 
naturall to the writer, many times his peculier by election and arte, and 
such as either he keepeth by skill, or holdeth on by ignorance, and will not or 
peraduenture cannot easily alter into any other. So we say that 
<hi>Ciceroes</hi> stile, and <hi>Salusts</hi> were not one, nor <hi>Cesars</hi> and 
<hi>Liuies</hi>, nor <hi>Homers</hi> and <hi>Hesiodus</hi>, nor <hi>Herodotus</hi>
and <hi>Theucidides</hi>, nor <hi>Europides</hi> &amp; <hi>Aristophanes</hi>, nor 
<hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Budeus</hi> stiles. And because this continuall course 
and manner of writing or speech sheweth the <pb n="124"/>
matter and disposition of the writers minde, more than one or few words or 
sentences can shew, therefore there be that haue called stile, the image of 
man [<hi>mentus character</hi>] for man is but his minde, and as him minde is 
tempered and qualified, so are his speeches and language at large, and his 
inward conceits be the mettall of his minde, and his manner of vtterance the 
very warp &amp; woofe of his conceits, more plaine, or busie and intricate, 
or otherwise affected after the rate. Most men say that not any one point in 
all <hi>Phisiognomy</hi> is so certaine, as to iudge a mans manners by his eye: 
but more assuredly in mine opinion, by his dayly maner of speech and 
ordinary writing. For if the man be graue, his speech and stile is graue: if 
light-headed, his stile and language also light: if the mine be haughtie and 
hoate, the speech and stile is also vehement and stirring: if it be colde and 
temperate, the stile is also very modest: if it be humble, or base and meeke, 
so is also the language and stile. And yet peraduenture not altogether so, but 
that euery mans stile is for the most part according to the matter and 
subiect of the writer, or so ought to be, and conformable thereunto. Then 
againe may it be said as well, that men doo chuse their subiects according 
to the mettal of their minds, &amp; therfore a high minded man chuseth him 
high &amp; lofty matter to write of. The base courage, matter base &amp; 
lowe, the meane &amp; modest mind, meane &amp; moderate matters after 
the rate. Howsoeuer it be, we finde that vnder these three principall 
complexions (if I may with leaue so terme them) high, meane and base stile, 
there be contained many other humors or qualities of stile, as the plaine and 
obscure, the rough and smoth, the facill and hard, the plentifull and 
barraine, the rude and eloquent, the strong and feeble, the vehement and cold 
stiles, all which in their euill are to be reformed, and the good to be kept 
and vsed. But generally to haue the stile decent &amp; comely it behooueth 
the maker or Poet to follow the nature of his subiect, that is if his matter 
be high and loftie that the stile be so to, if meane, the stile also to be 
meane, if base the stile humble and base accordingly: and they that do 
otherwise vse it, applying to meane matter, hie and loftie stile, and to hie 
matters, stile eyther meane or base, and to the base matters, the meane or 
hie stile, to vtterly disgrace their poesie and shew themselues nothing 
skilfull in their arte, nor hauing regard <pb n="125"/>
to the decencie, which is the chiefe praise of any writer. Therefore to ridde 
all louers of learning from that errour, I will as neere as I can set downe, 
which matters be the hie and loftie, which be but meane, and which be low 
and base, to the intent the stiles, may be fashioned to the matters, and 
keepe their <hi>decorum</hi> and good proportion in euery respect: I am 
not ignorant that many good clerkes be contrary to mine opinion, and say that 
the loftie style may be decently vsed in a meane and base subiect &amp; 
contrariwise, which I do in parte acknowledge, but with a reasonable 
qualification. For <hi>Homer</hi> hath so vsed it in his trifling worke of 
<hi>Batrachomyomachia</hi>: that is in his treatise of the warre betwext the 
frogs and the mice. <hi>Virgill</hi> also in his <hi>bucolickes</hi>, and in his 
<hi>georgicks</hi>, whereof the one is counted meane, the other base, that is 
the husbandmans discourses and the shepheards, but hereunto serueth a 
reason in my simple conceite: for first to that trifling poeme of 
<hi>Homer</hi>, though the frog and the mouse be but litle and ridiculous 
beasts, yet to treat of warre is an high subiect, and a thing in euery respect 
terrible and daungerous to them that it alights on: and therefore of learned 
dutie asketh martiall grandiloquence, if it be set foorth in his kind and 
nature of warre, euen betwixt the basest creatures that can be imagined: so 
also is the Ante or pismire, and they be but little creeping things, not 
perfect beasts, but <hi>insects</hi>, or wormes: yet in describing their nature 
&amp; instinct, and their manner of life approching to the forme of a 
common-welth, and their properties not vnlike to the vertues of most 
excellent gouernors and captaines, it asketh a more maiestie of speach then 
would the description of any other beastes life or nature, and perchance of 
many matters perteyning vnto the baser sort of men, because it resembleth 
the historie of a ciuill regiment, and of them all the chiefe and most 
principall which is <hi>Monarchie</hi>: so also in his <hi>bucolicks</hi>, which 
are but pastorall speaches and the basest of any other poeme in their owne 
proper nature: <hi>Virgill</hi> vsed a somewhat swelling stile when eh came 
to insinuate the birth of <hi>Marcellus</hi> heire apparant to the Emperour 
<hi>Augustus</hi>, as child to his sister, aspiring by hope and greatnes of the 
house, to the succession of the Empire, and establishment thereof in that 
familie: whereupon <hi>Virgill</hi> could do no lesse then to vse such manner 
of stile, whatsoeuer <pb n="126"/>
condition the poeme were of and this was decent, &amp; no fault or 
blemish, to confound the tennors of the stiles for that cause. But now when 
I remember me againe that this <hi>Eglogue</hi>, (for I haue read it 
somewhere) was conceiued by <hi>Octauian</hi> th'Emperour to be written to 
the honour of <hi>Pollio</hi> a citizen of Rome, &amp; of no great nobilitie, the 
same was misliked againe as an implicatiue, nothing decent nor 
proportionable to <hi>Pollio</hi> his fortunes and calling, in which respect I 
might say likewise the stile was not to be such as if it had bene for the 
Emperours own honour, and those of the bloud imperiall, then which subiect 
there could not be among the <hi>Romane</hi> writers an higher nor grauer to 
treat vpon: so can I not be remoued from mine opinion, but still me thinks 
that in all decencie the stile ought to conforme with the nature of the 
subiect, otherwise if a writer will seeme to obserue no <hi>decorum</hi> at 
all, nor passe how he fashion his tale to his matter, who doubteth but he 
may in the lightest cause speake like a Pope, &amp; in the grauest matters 
prate like a parrat, &amp; finde wordes &amp; phrases ynough to serue both 
turnes, and neither of them commendably, for neither is all that may be 
written of Kings and Princes such as ought to keepe a high stile, nor all that 
may be written vpon a shepheard to keepe the low, but according to the 
matter reported, if that be of high or base nature: for euer pety pleasure, 
and vayne delight of a king are not to accompted high matter for the height 
of his estate, but meane and perchaunce very base and vile: nor so a Poet or 
historiographer, could decently with a high stile reporte the vanities of 
<hi>Nero</hi>, the ribaudries of <hi>Caligula</hi>, the idlenes of <hi>Domitian</hi>, 
&amp; the riots of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>. But well the magnimitie and 
honorable ambition of <hi>Caesar</hi>, the prosperities of <hi>Augustus</hi>, the 
grauitie of <hi>Tiberius</hi>, the bountie of <hi>Traiane</hi>, the wisedome of 
<hi>Aurelius</hi>, and generally all that which concerned the highest honours 
of Emperours, their birth, alliaunces, gouernement, exploits in warre and 
peace, and other publike affaires: for they be matter stately and high, and 
require a stile to be lift vp and aduanced by choyse of wordes, phrases, 
sentences, and figures, high, loftie, eloquent &amp; magnifik in proportion: 
so be the meane matters, to be caried with all wordes and speaches of 
smothnesse and pleasant moderation, &amp; finally the base things to be 
holden within <pb n="127"/>
their teder, by a low, myld, and simple maner of vtterance, creeping 
rather then clyming, &amp; marching rather then mounting vpwardes, with 
the wings of the stately subiects and stile.

so that in euery of the sayd three degrees not the selfe same vertues be

common Poesies of loues, and such like in the meane stile, some to the base

hereafter when we come to speake of figure and phrase: also some wordes

made foolish and ridiculous by all wordes affected, counterfait, and puffed 
vp, as it were a windball carrying more countenance then matter, and can 
not be better resembled then to these midsommer pageants in London, where 
to make the people wonder are set forth great and vglie Gyants marching as

guilefully discouer and turne to a great derision: also all darke and 
vnaccustomed workes, or rusticall and homely, and sentences that hold too 
much of the mery &amp; light, or infamous &amp; vnshamefast are to

called <hi>Paremia</hi>: then by merry skoffe called <hi>Irona</hi>: then by 
bitter tawnt called <hi>Sarcasmus</hi>: then by periphrase or circumlocution 
when all might be said in a word or two: then by incredible comparison 
giuing credit, as by your <hi>Hyperbole</hi>, and many other waies seeking to 
inueigle and appassionate the mind: which thing made the graue iudges 
<hi>Areopagites</hi> (as I find written) to forbid all manner of figuratiue 
speaches to be vsed before them in their consistorie of Iustice, as meere 
illusions to the minde, and wresters of vpright iudgement, saying that to 
allow such manner of forraine &amp; couloured talke to make the iudges 
affectioned, were <pb n="129"/>
all one as if the carpenter before he began to square his timber would make 
his squire coroked: in so much as the straite and vpright mind of a Iudge is 
the very rule of iustice till it be peruerted by affection. This no doubt is 
true and was by them grauely considered: but in this case because our 
maker or Poet is appointed not for a iudge, but rather for a pleader, and that 
of pleasant &amp; louely causes and nothing perillous, such as be those for 
the triall of life, limme, or liuelyhood; and before iudges neither sower nor 
seuere, but in the eare of princely dames, yong ladies, gentlewomen and 
courtiers, beying all for the most part either meeke of nature, or of pleasant 
humour, and that all his abuses tende but to dispose the hearers to mirth and 
sollace by pleasant conueyance and efficacy of speach, they are not in truth 
to be accompted vices but for vertues in the poetical science very 
commendable. On the other side, such trespasses in speach (whereof there 
be many) as geue dolour and disliking to the eare &amp; minde, by any foule 
indecencie or disproportion of sound, situation, or sence, they be called and 
not without cause the vicious parts or rather heresies of language: 
wherefore the matter resteth much in the definition and acceptance of this 
word [<hi>decorum</hi>] for whatsoeuer is so, cannot iustly be misliked. In 
which respect it may come to passe that what the Grammarian setteth down 
for a viciositee in speach may become a vertue and no vice, contrariwise his 
commended figure may fall into a reprochfull fault: the best and most 
assured remedy whereof is, generally to follow the saying of <hi>Bias: ne 
quid nimis</hi>. So as in keeping measure, and not exceeding nor shewing any 
defect in the vse of his figures, he cannot lightly do amisse, if he haue 
besides (as that must needes be) a speciall regard to all circumstances of 
the person, place, time, cause and purpose he hath in hand, which being well 
obserued it easily auoideth all the recited inconueniences, and maketh now 
and then very vice goe for a formall vertue in the exercise of this Arte.

               <head>Sixe points set downe by our learned forefathers for a generall regiment of all good utterance be it by mouth or by writing.</head>
               <p>Bvt before there had bene yet any precise obseruation made of figuratiue 
speeches, the first learned artificers of language considered <pb n="130"/>
that the bewtie and good grace of vtterance rested in no many 
pointes: and whatsoeuer transgressed those lymits, they counted it for 
vitious; and thereupon did set downe a manner of regiment in all speech 
generally to be obserued, consisting in sixe pointes. First they said that 
there ought to be kept a decent proportion in our writings and speach, which 
they termed <hi>Analogia</hi>. Secondly, that it ought to be voluble vpon the 
tongue, and tunable to the eare, which they called <hi>Tasis</hi>. Thirdly, that 
it were not tediously long, but briefe and compendious, as the matter might 
beare, which they called <hi>Syntomia</hi>. Fourthly, that it should cary an 
orderly and good construction, which they called <hi>Synthesis</hi>. Fiftly, 
that it should be a sound, proper and naturall speach, which they called 
<hi>Curiologia</hi>. Sixtly, that it should be liuely &amp; stirring, which they 
called <hi>Tropus</hi>. So as it appeareth by this order of theirs, that no vice 
could be committed in speech, keeping within the bounds of that restraint. 
Bit sir, all this being by them very well conceiued, there remayned a greater 
difficultie to know what this proportion, volubilitie, good construction, 
&amp; the rest were, otherwise we could not be euer the more relieued. It 
was therefore of necessitie that a more curious and particular description 
should bee made of euery manner of speech, either transgressing or agreeing 
with their said generall prescript. Whereupon it came to passe, that all the 
commendable parts of speech were set foorth by the name of figures, and all 
the illaudable partes vnder the name of vices, or viciosities, both of which 
it shall be spoken in their places.

               <head>How the Greeks first, and afterward the Latines, inuented new names for euery figure, which this Author is also enforced to doo in his vulgar.</head>
               <p>The Greekes were a happy people for the freedome &amp; liberty of their 
language, because it was allowed them to inuent any new name that they 
lifted and to peece many words together to make of them one entire much 
more significatiue than the single word. So among other things did they to 
their figuratiue speeches deuise certaine names. The Latines came 
somewhat behind them in that <pb n="131"/>
point, and for want of conuenient single wordes to expresse that which the 
Greekes could do by cobling many words together, they were faine to vse the 
Greekes still, till after many yeares that the learned Oratours and good 
Grammarians among the Romaines, as <hi>Cicero, Varro, Quintilian</hi>, &amp; 
others strained themselues to giue the Greeke wordes Latine names, and yet 
nothing so apt and fitty. The same course are we driuen to follow in this 
description, since we are enforced to cull out for the vse of our Poet or 
maker all the most commendable figures. Now to make them knowen (as 
behoueth) either we must do it by th'originall Greeke name or by the Latine, 
or by our owne. But when I consider to what sort of Readers I write, &amp; 
how ill faring the Greeke terme would sound in the English eare, then also 
how short the Latines come to expresse manie of the Greeke originals. 
Finally, how well our language serueth to supplie the full signification of 
them both, I haue thought it no lesse lawfull, yea peraduenture vnder license 
of the learned, more laudable to vse our owne naturall, if they be well 
chosen, and of proper signification, than to borrow theirs. So shall not our 
English Poets, though they be to seeke of the Greeke and Latin languages, 
lament for lack of knowledge sufficient to the purpose of this arte. And in 
case any of these new English names giuen by me to any figure, shall happen 
to offend. I pray that he learned will beare with me and to thinke the 
straungenesse thereof proceedes but of noueltie and disaquaintance with 
our eares, which in processe of tyme, and by custome will frame very well: 
and such others as are not learned in the primitiue languages, if they happen 
to hit vpon any new name of myne (so ridiculous in their opinion) as may 
moue them to laughter, let such persons, yet assure themselues that such 
names go as neare as may be to their originals, or els serue better to the 
purpose of the figure then the very originall, reseruing alwayes, that such 
new name should not be vnpleasant in our vulgar nor harsh vpon the tong: 
and where it shall happen otherwise, that it may please the reader to thinke 
that hardly any other name in our English could be found to serue the turne 
better. Againe if to auoid the hazard of this blame I should haue kept the 
Greek or Latin still it would haue appeared a little too scholasticall for our 
makers, and a peece of worke <pb n="132"/>
more fit for clerkes then for Courtiers for whose instruction this trauaile 
is taken: and if I should haue left out both the Greeke and Latine name, and 
put in none of our owne neither: well perchance might the rule of the figure 
haue bene set downe, but no conuenient name to hold him in memory. It was 
therfore expedient we deuised for euery figure of importance his vulgar 
name, and to ioyne the Greeke or Latine originall with them; after that sort 
much better satisfying aswel the vulgar as the learned learner, and also the 
authors owne purpose, which is to make of a rude rimer, a learned and a 
Courtly Poet.

               <head>A diuision of figures, and how they serue in exornation of language.</head>
               <p>And because our chiefe purpose herein is for the learning of Ladies and 
young Gentlewomen, or idle Courtiers, desirous to become skilful in their 
owne mother tongue, and for their priuate recreation to make now &amp; 
then dittie of pleasure, thinking for our parte none other science so fit for 
them &amp; the place as that which teacheth <hi>beau</hi> semblant, the 
chiefe profession aswell of Courting as of poesie: since to such manner of 
mindes nothing is more combersome then tedious doctrines and schollarly 
methodes of discipline, we haue in our owne conceit deuised a new and 
strange modell of this arte, fitter to please the Court then the schoole, and 
yet not vnnecessarie for all such as be willing themselues to become good 
makers in the vulgar, or to be able to iudge of other mens makings: 
wherefore, intending to follow the course which we haue begun, thus we say: 
that though the language of our Poet or maker being pure &amp; clenly, 
&amp; not disgraced by such vicious parts as haue bene before remembred in 
the Chapter of language, be sufficiently pleasing and commendable for the 
ordinarie vse of speech; yet is not the same so well appointed for all 
purposes of the excellent Poet, as when it is gallantly arrayed in all his 
colours which figure can set vpon it, therefore we are now further to 
determine of figures and figuratiue speeches. Figuratiue speech is a 
noueltie of language euidently (and yet not absurdly) estranged from the 
ordinarie habite and manner of our dayly talke and writing <pb n="133"/>
and figure it selfe is a certaine liuely or good grace set vpon wordes, 
speaches and sentences to some purpose and not in vaine, giuing them 
ornament or efficacie by many maner of alterations in shape, in sounde, and 
also in sence, sometime by way of surplusage, sometime by defect, 
sometime by disorder, or mutation, &amp; also by putting into our speaches 
more pithe and substance, subtiltie, quicknesse, efficacie or moderation, in 
this or that sort tuning and tempring them by amplification, abridgement, 
opening, closing, enforcing, meekening, or otherwise disposing them to the 
best purpose: whereupon the learned clerks who haue written methodically 
of this Arte in the two master languages, Greeke and Latine, haue sorted all 
their figures into three rankes, and the first they bestowed vpon the Poet 
onely: the second vpon the Poet and Oratour indifferently: the third vpon 
the Oratour alone. And that first sort of figures doth serue th'eare onely and 
may be therefore called <hi>Auricular</hi>: your second serues the conceit 
onely and not th'eare, and may be called <hi>sensable</hi>, not sensible nor yet 
sententious: your third sort serues as well th'eare as the conceit and may 
be called <hi>sententious figures</hi>, because not only they properly 
apperteine to full sentences, for bewtifying them with a currant &amp; 
pleasant numerositie, but also giuing them efficacie, and enlarging the 
whole matter besides with copious amplifications. I doubt not but some 
busie carpers will scorne at my new deuised termes: <hi>auricular</hi> and 
<hi>sensable</hi>, saying that I might with better warrant haue vsed in their 
steads these words, <hi>orthographicall</hi> or <hi>syntacticall</hi>, which the 
learned Grammarians left ready made to our hands, and do import as much as 
th'other that I haue brought, which thing peraduenture I deny not in part, and 
neuerthelesse for some cause; thought them not so necessarie: but with 
these maner of men I do willingly beare, in respect of their laudable 
endeuour to allow antiquitie and flie innouation: with like beneuolence I 
trust they will beare with me writing in the vulgar speach and seeking by 
my nouelties to satisfie not the schoole but the Court: whereas they know 
very well all old things soone waxe stale &amp; lothsome, and the new 
deuises are euer dainty and delicate, the vulgar instruction requiring also 
vulgar and comunicable termes, not clerkly or vncouthe as are all these of 
the Greeke and Latine languages <pb n="134"/>
primitiuely receiued, vnlesse they be qualified or by much vse and custome 
allowed and our eares made acquainted with them. Thus then I say that 
<hi>auricular</hi> figures be those which worke alteration in th'eare by sound, 
accent, time, and slipper volubilitie in vtteraunce, such as for that respect 
was called by the auncients numerositie of speach. And not onely the whole 
body of a tale in poeme or historie may be made in such sort pleasant and 
agreable to the eare, but also euery clause by it selfe, and euery single word 
carried in a clause, may haue their pleasant sweetenesse apart. And so long 
as this qualitie extendeth but to the outward tuning of the speach reaching 
no higher then th'eare and forcing the mynde little or nothing, it is that 
vertue which the Greeks call <hi>Enargia</hi> and is the office of the 
<hi>auricular</hi>figures to performe. Therefore as the members of language 
at large are whole sentences, and sentences are compact of clauses, and 
clauses of words, and euery word of letters and sillables, so is the 
alteration (be it but of a sillable or letter) much materiall to the sound and 
sweetenesse of vtterance. Wherefore beginning first at the smallest 
alterations which rest in letters and sillables, the first sort of our figures 
<hi>auricular</hi> we do appoint to single words as they lye in language; the 
second to clauses of speach; the third to perfit sentences and to the whole 
masse of body of the tale be it poeme or historie written or reported.

               <p>As your single words may be many waies transfigured to make the meetre or 
verse more tunable and melodious, so also may <pb n="136"/>
your whole and entire clauses be in such sort contriued by the order of their 
construction as the eare may receiue a certaine recreation, although the 
mind for any noueltie of sence be little or nothing affected. And therefore 
al your figures of <hi>grammaticall</hi> construction I accompt them but 
merely <hi>auricular</hi> in that they reach no furder then the eare. To which 
there will appeare some sweete or vnsauery point to offer your dolour or 
delight, either by some euident defect, or surplusage, or disorder, or 
immutation in the same speaches notably altering either the congruitie 
<hi>grammaticall</hi>, or the sence, or both. And first of those that worke by 
defect, if but one word or some little portion of speach be wanting, it may 
be supplied by ordinary vnderstanding and vertue of the figure 
<hi>Eclipsis</hi>, as to say <hi>so early a man</hi>, for [<hi>are ye</hi>] so early a 
man: he is to be intreated, for he is [<hi>easie</hi>] to be intreated: I thanke 
God I am to liue like a Gentleman, for I am [<hi>able</hi>] to liue, and the 
Spaniard said in his deuise of armes <hi>acuerdo oluido</hi>, I remember I 
forget whereas in right congruitie of speach it should be I remember that I 
[doo] forget. And in a deuise of our owne [<hi>empechement pur a 
choiseon</hi>] a let for a furderance whereas it should be said [<hi>use</hi>] a 
let for a furderance, and a number morelike speaches defectiue, and supplied 
by common vnderstanding. 


</p>
               <p>But if it be to mo clauses then one, that some such word be supplied to 
perfit the congruitie or sence of them all, it is by the figure [<hi>Zeugma</hi>] 
we call him the [<hi>single supplie</hi>] because by one word we serue many 
clauses of one congruitie, and may be likened to the man that serues many 
maisters at once, but all of one country or kinred: as to say. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fellowes and friends and kinne forsooke me quite</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here this word forsooke satisfieth the congruitie and sence of all three 
clauses, which would require euery of them asmuch. And as we setting 
forth her Maiesties regall petigree, said in this figure of [<hi>Single 
supplie</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her grandsires Father and Brother was a King</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her mother a crowned Queene, her Sister and her selfe</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Whereas ye see this one word [<hi>was</hi>] serues them all in that they 
require but one congruitie and sence. 


</p>
               <p>Yet hath this figure of [<hi>Single supply</hi>] another propertie, occasioning <pb n="137"/>
him to change now and then his name: by the order of his supplie, 
for if it be placed in the forefront of all the seuerall clauses whome he is to 
serue as a common seruitour, then is he called by the Greeks 
<hi>Prozeugma</hi>, by vs the Ringleader: thus 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her beautie perst mine eye, her speach mine wofull hart:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her presence all the powers of my discourse. &amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Where ye see this one word [<hi>perst</hi>] placed in the foreward, satisfieth 
both in sence &amp; congruitie all those other clauses that followe him. 


</p>
               <p>And if such word of supplie be place in the middle of all such clauses as he 
serues: it is by the Greeks called <hi>Mezozeugma</hi>, by vs the 
[<hi>Middlemarcher</hi>] thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Faire maydes beautie (alacke) with yeares it weares away,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And with wether and sicknes, and sorrow as they say</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where ye see this word [<hi>weares</hi>] serues one clause before him, and 
two clauses behind him; in one and the same sence and congruitie. And in 
this verse, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Either the troth or talke nothing at all</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where this worde [<hi>talke</hi>] serues the clause before and also behind. 
But if such supplie be placed after all the clauses, and not before nor in the 
middle, then is he called by the Greeks <hi>Hypozeugma</hi>, and by vs the 
[<hi>Rerewarder</hi>] thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>My mates that wont, to keepe me companie,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And my neighbours, who dwelt next to my wall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The friends that sware, they would not sticke to die</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In my quarrell: they are fled from me all</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where ye see this word [<hi>fled from me</hi>] serue all the three clauses 
requiring but one congruitie &amp; sence. But if such want be in sundrie 
clauses, and of seuerall congruities or sence, and the supply be made to 
serue them all, it is by the figure <hi>Sillepsis</hi>, whom for that respect we 
call the [<hi>double supplie</hi>] comceiuing, and as it were, comprehending 
vnder one, a supplie of two natures, and may be likened to the man that 
serues many masters at once, being of strange Countries or kinreds, as in 
these verses, where the lamenting widow shewed the Pilgrim the graues in 
which her husband &amp; children lay buried. 
<pb n="138"/>
               </p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Here my sweete sonnes and daughters all my blisse,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Yonder mine owne deere husband buried is</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where ye see one verbe singular supplyeth the plurall and singular, and thus 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Iudge ye louers, if it be strange or no.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My Ladie laughs for ioy, and I for wo</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where ye see a third person supplie himselfe and a first person. And thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Madame ye neuer shewed your selfe untrue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor my deserts would euer suffer you</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Viz. to show. Where ye see the moode Indicatiue supply him selfe and an 
Infinitiue. And the like in these other. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I neuer yet failde you in constancie,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor neuer doo intend untill I die</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Viz. [<hi>to show</hi>.] Thus much for the congruitie, now for the sence. One 
wrote thus of a young man, who slew a villaine that had killed his father, 
and rauished his mother. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thus valiantly and with a manly minde,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And by one feate of euerlasting fame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>This lustie lad fully requited kinde,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His fathers death, and eke his mothers shame</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where ye see this word [<hi>requite</hi>] serue a double sence: that is to 
say, to reuenge, and to satisfie. For the parents iniurie was reuenged, and 
the duetie of nature performed or satisfied by the childe. but if this supplie 
be made to sundrie clauses, or to one clause sundrie times iterated, and by 
seuerall words, so as euery clause hath his owne supplie: then is it called 
by the Greekes <hi>Hypozeuxis</hi>, we call him the substitute after his 
originall, and is a supplie with iteration, as thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Vnto the king she went, and to the king she said,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mine owne liege Lord behold thy poore handmaid</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here [<hi>went to the king</hi>] and [<hi>said to the king</hi>] be but one clause 
iterated with words of sundrie supply. Or as in these verses following. 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>My Ladie gaue me, my Lady wist not what,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Geuing me leaue to be her Soueraine:</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>For by such gift my Ladie hath done that,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Which whilest she liues she may not call againe</hi>. </l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="139"/>
Here [<hi>my Ladie gaue</hi> and [<hi>my Ladie wist</hi>] be supplies with 
iteration, by vertue of this figure. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another <hi>auricular</hi> figure of defect, and is when we begin to 
speake a thing, and breake of in the middle way, as if either it needed no 
further to be spoken of, or that we were ashamed, or afraide to speake it 
out. It is also sometimes done by way of threatning, and to shew a 
moderation of anger. The Greekes call him <hi>Aposiopesis</hi>. I, the figure 
of silence, or of interruption, indifferently. 


</p>
               <p>If we doo interrupt our speech for feare, this may be an example, where as 
one durst not make the true report as it was, but staid halfe way for feare 
of offence, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>He said you were, I dare not tell you plaine:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For words once out, neuer returne againe</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>If it be for shame, or that the speaker suppose it would be indecent to tell 
all, then thus: as he that said to his sweete hart, whom he checked for 
secretly whispering with a suspected person. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>And did ye not come by his chamber dore?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And tell him that: goe to, I say no more</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>If it be for anger or by way of manace or to show a moderation of wrath as 
the graue and discreeter sort of men do, then thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>If I take you with such another cast</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I sweare by God, but let this be the last</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Thinking to haue said further viz. I will punish you. 


</p>
               <p>If it be for none of all these causes, but vpon some sodaine occasion that 
moues a man to breake of his tale, then thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>He told me all at large: lo yonder is the man</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Let himselfe tell the tale that best tell can</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>This figure is fit for phantasticall heads and such as be sodaine or lack 
memorie. I know one of good learning that greatly blemisheth his discretion 
with this maner of speach: for if he be in the grauest matter of the world 
talking, he will vpon the sodaine for the flying of a bird ouerthwart the way, 
or some other such sleight cause, interrupt his tale and neuer returne to it 
againe. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue yet another maner of speach purporting at the first blush a defect 
which afterward is supplied the, the Greekes call him <hi>Prolepsis</hi>, we 
the Propounder, or the Explaner which ye will: because he workes both 
effectes, as thus, where in certaine verses we <pb n="140"/>
describe the triumphant enter-view of two great Princesses thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>These two great Queenes, came marching hand in hand,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Vnto the hall, where store of Princes stand:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And people of all countreys to behold,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Coronis all clad, in purple cloth of gold:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Celiar in robes, of siluer tissew white,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With rich rubies, and pearles all bedighte</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here ye see the first proposition in a sort defectiue and of imperfect sence, 
till ye come by diuision to explane and enlarge it, but if we should follow 
the originall right, we ought rather to call him the forestaller, for like as he 
that standes in the market way, and takes all vp before it come to the 
market in grosse and sells it by retaile, so by this maner of speach our 
maker setts down before all the matter by a brief proposition, and 
afterward explanes it by a diuision more particularly. 


</p>
               <p>By this other example it appeares also. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then deare Lady I pray you let it bee,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That our long loue may lead us to agree:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Me since I may not wed you to my wife,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To serue you as a mistresse all my life:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ye that may not me for your husband haue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To clayme me for your seruant and your slaue</hi>. </l>

               <head>Of your figures Auricular working by disorder.</head>
               <p>To all their speaches which wrought by disorder the Greekes gaue a general 
name [<hi>Hiperbaton</hi>] as much to say as the [<hi>trespasser</hi>] and 
because such disorder may be committed many wayes it receiueth sundry 
particulars vnder him, whereof some are onely proper to the Greekes and 
Latines and not to vs, other some ordinarie in our maner of speaches, but so 
foule and intollerable as I will not seeme to place them among the figures, 
but do raunge them as they deserue among the vicious or faultie speaches. 


</p>
               <p>Your first figure of tollerable disorder is [<hi>Parenthesis</hi>] or by an 
English name the [<hi>Insertour</hi>] and is when ye will seeme for larger 
information or some other purpose, to peece or graffe in the middest of your 
tale an vnnecessary parcell of speach, which neuerthelesse <pb n="141"/>
may be thence without any detriment to the rest. The figure is so 
common that it needeth none example, neuerthelesse because we are to 
teache Ladies and Gentlewomen to know their school points and termes 
appertaining to the Art, we may not refuse to yeeld examples euen in the 
plainest cases, as that of maister <hi>Diars</hi> very aptly.

                  <hi>That loue I say, that lucklesse loue, that works me all this ill</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Also in our Eglogue intituled <hi>Elpine</hi>, which we made being but 
eightene yeares old, to king <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt a Prince of great hope, 
we surmised that the Pilot of a ship answering the King, being inquisitiue 
and desirous to know all the parts of the ship and tackle, what they were, 
&amp; to what vse they serued, vsing this insertion or Parenthesis.

               <p>This insertion is very long and vtterly impertinent to the principall matter, 
and makes a great gappe in the tale, neuerthelesse is no disgrace but rather 
a bewtie and to very good purpose, but you must not vse such insertions 
often nor to thick, nor those that bee very long as this of ours, for it will 
breede great confusion to haue the tale so much interrupted. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another manner of disordered speach, when ye misplace your words 
or clauses and set that before which should be behind &amp; <hi>è 
conuerso</hi>, we call it in English prouerbe, the cart before the horse, the 
Greeks call it <hi>Histeron proteron</hi>, we name it the Preposterous, and if 
it be not too much vsed is tollerable inough, and many times scarse 
perceiueable vnlesse the sence be thereby made very abused: as he that 
described his manner of departure from his mistresse, said thus not much to 
be misliked.

leaue before the kisse, or that it be all one busines. It seemes the taking 
leaue is by vsing some speach, intreating license of departure: the kisse a 
knitting vp of the farewell, and as it were a testimoniall of the license 
without which here in England one may not presume of courtesie to depart, 
let yong Courtiers decide this controuersie. Our describing his landing vpon 
a strange coast, sayd thus preposterously.

               <head>Of auricular figures working by exchange.</head>
               <p>Your figures that worke <hi>auricularly</hi> by exchange, were more 
obseruable to the Greekes and Latines for the brauenesse of their language, 
ouer that ours is, and for the multiplicitie of their Grammaticall accidents, 
or verball affects, as I may terme them, that is to say, their diuers cases, 
moodes, tenses, genders, with variable terminations, by reason whereof, 
they changed not the very word, but kept the word, and changed the shape of 
him onely, vsing one case for another, or tense, or person, or gender, or 
number, or moode. We, hauing no such varietie of accidents, haue little or <pb n="143"/>
no vse of this figure. The called it <hi>Enallage</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>But another sort of exchange which they had, and very prety, we doe 
likewise vse, not changing one word for another, by their accidents or cases, 
as the <hi>Enallage</hi>: nor by the places, as the [<hi>Preposterous</hi>] but 
changing their true construction and application, whereby the sence is quite 
peruerted and made very absurd: as, he that should say, for <hi>tell me troth 
and lie not, lie me troth and tell not</hi>. For <hi>come dine with me and stay 
not, come stay with me and dine not</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>A certaine piteous louer, to moue his mistres to compassion, wrote among 
other amorous verses, this one. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Madame, I set your eyes before mine woes</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>For, mine woes before your eyes, spoken to th'intent to winne fauour in her 
sight. 


</p>
               <p>But that was pretie of a certaine sorrie man of law, that gaue his Client but 
bad councell, and yet found fault with his fee, and said: my fee, good frend, 
hath deserued better counsel. Good master, quoth the Client, if your selfe 
had not said so, I would neuer haue beleeued it: but now I thinke as you doo. 
The man of law perceiuing his error, I tell thee (quoth he) my counsel hath 
deserued a better fee. Yet of all others was that a most ridiculous, but very 
true exchange, which the yeoman of London vsed with his Sergeant at the 
Mace, who said he would goe into the countrie, and make merry a day or two, 
while his man plyed his busines at home: an example of it you shall finde in 
our Enterlude entituled Lustie London: the Sergeant, for sparing of hors-hire, 
said he would goe with the Carrier on foote. That is not for your 
worship, said his yeoman, whereunto the Sergeant replyed. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I wot what I meane Iohn, it is for to stay</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And company the knaue Carrier, for loosing my way</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The yeoman thinking it good manner to soothe his Sergeant, said againe, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I meane what I wot Sir, your vest is to hie,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>And carrie a knaue with you for companie</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Ye see a notorious exchange of the construction, and application of the 
words in this: <hi>I wot what I meane</hi>; and <hi>I meane what I wot</hi>, and 
in the other, <hi>company the knaue Carrier</hi>, and <hi>carrie a knaue in your 
company</hi>. The Greekes call this figure [<hi>Hipallage</hi>] <pb n="144"/>
the Latins <hi>Submutatio</hi>, we in our vulgar may call him the 
[<hi>underchange</hi>] but I had rather haue him called the [<hi>Changeling</hi>] 
nothing at all sweruing from his originall, and much more aptly to the 
purpose, and pleasanter to beare in memory: specially for our Ladies and 
pretie mistresses in Court, for whose learning I write, because it is a terme 
often in their mouthes, and alluding to the opinion of Nurses, who are wont 
to say, that the Fayries vse to steale the fairest children out of their 
cradles, and put other ill fauoured in their places, which they called 
changelings, or Elfs, so, if ye mark, doeth our Poet, or maker play with his 
wordes, vsing a wrong construction for a right, and an absurd for a sensible, 
by manner of exchange.

               <p>The Greeks vsed a manner of speech or writing in their proses, that went by 
clauses, finishing in words of like tune, and might be by vsing like cases, 
tenses, and other points of consonance, which they called

               <p>The craking Scotts as the Cronicle reportes at a certaine time made this

               </l>
               <p>Which is no perfit rime in deede, but clauses finishing in the self same tune: 
for a rime of good simphonie should not conclude his concords with one 
&amp; the same terminant sillable, as <hi>less, less, less</hi>, but with diuers 
and like terminants, as <hi>les, pres, mes</hi>, as was before declared in the 
chapter of your cadences, and your clauses in prose should neither finish 
with the same nor with the like terminants, but with the contrary as hath 
bene shewed before in the booke of proportions, yet many vse it otherwise, 
neglecting the Poeticall harmonie and skill. And th'Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi>
with Syr <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> the most excellent makers of their time, more 
peraduenture respecting the fitnesse and ponderositie of their wordes then 
the true cadence or simphonie, were very licencious in this point. We call 
this figure following the originall, the [<hi>like loose</hi>] alluding to 
th'Archers terme who is not said to finishe the feate of his shot before he 
giue the loose, and deliuer his arrow from his bow, in which respect we vse 
to say marke the loose of a thing for marke the end of it. 


</p>
               <p>Ye do by another figure notably affect th'eare when ye make euery word of 
the verse to begin with a like letter, as for example in this verse written in 
an <hi>Epithaphe</hi> of our making. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Time tried his truth his trauailes and his trust,</hi>

                  <hi>And time to late tried his integritie</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>It is a figure much vsed by our common rimers, and doth well if it be not too 
much vsed, for then it falleth into the vice which shalbe hereafter spoken of 
called <hi>Tautologia</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another sort of speach in a maner defectiue because it wants good 
band or coupling, and is the figure [<hi>Asyndeton</hi>] we call him [<hi>loose

                  <hi>I came, I saw, I ouercame</hi>.

               <p>The Prince of Orenge for his deuise of Armes in banner displayed against the

</l>
               <p>It is a figure to be vsed when we will seeme to make hast, or to be earnest, 
and these examples with a number more be spoken by the figure of [<hi>lose 
language</hi>]. 


</p>
               <p>Quite contrary to this ye haue another maner of construction which they 
called [<hi>Polisindeton</hi>] we may call him the [<hi>couple clause</hi>] for 
that euery clause is knit and coupled together with a coniunctiue thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>And I saw it, and I say it and I</hi>

                  <hi>And cares for thee ten thousand wayes</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Ye haue another maner of speach drawen out at length and going all after one 
tenure and with an imperfit sence till you come to the last word or verse 
which concludes the whole premisses with a perfit sence &amp; full 
periode, the Greeks call it <hi>Irmus</hi>, I call him the [<hi>long loose</hi>] 
thus appearing in a dittie of Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> where he describes the

dittie till ye come to the last verse in these wordes <hi>my bed I thee 
forsake</hi>. And in another Sonet of <hi>Petrarcha</hi> which was thus

</p>
               <p>When ye will speake giuing euery person or thing besides his proper name a 
qualitie by way of addition whether it be of good or of bad it is a figuratiue

</l>
               <p>In stead, of [<hi>fortunes frowning face</hi>]. One praysing the Neapolitans 
for good men at armes, said by the figure of Twynnes thus.

               <head>Of the figures which we call Sensable, because they alter and affect the minde by alteration of sence, and first in single wordes.</head>
               <p>The eare hauing receiued his due satisfaction by the <hi>auricular</hi> figures, 
now must the minde also be serued, with his naturall delight by figures 
<hi>sensible</hi> such as by alteration of intendmentes affect the courage, 
and geue a good liking to the conceit. And first, single words haue their 
sence and vnderstanding altered and figured many wayes, to wit, by 
transport, abuse, crosse-naming, new naming, change of name. This will 
seeme very darke to you, vnlesse it be otherwise explaned more particularly: 
and first of <hi>Transport</hi>. There is a kind of wresting of a single word 
from his owne right signification, to another not so naturall, but yet of 
some affinitie or conueniencie with it, as to say, <hi>I cannot digest your 
unkinde words</hi>, for I cannot take them in good part: or as the man of law 
said, <hi>I feele you not</hi>, for I vnderstand not your case, because he had 
not his fee in his hand. Or as another said to a mouthy Aduocate, <hi>why 
barkest thou at me so sore?</hi> Or to call the top of a tree, or of a hill, the 
crowne of a tree or of a hill: for in deede <hi>crowne</hi> is the highest 
ornament of a Princes head, made like a close garland, or els the top of a 
mans head, where the haire windes about, and because such terme is not 
applyed naturally to a tree, or to a hill, but <pb n="149"/>
is transported from a mans head to a hill or tree, therefore it is called by 
<hi>metaphore</hi>, or the figure of <hi>transport</hi>. And three causes moues 
vs to vse this figure, one for necessitie or want of a better word, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>As the drie ground that thirstes after a showr</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Seemes to reioyce when it is well wet,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And speedely brings foorth both grasse and flowr,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>If lacke of sunne or season doo not let</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here for want of an apter and more naturall word to declare the drie temper 
of the earth, it is said to thirst &amp; to reioyce, which is onely proper to 
liuing creatures, and yet being so inuerted, doth not so mush swerue from 
the true sence, but that euery man can easilie conceiue the meaning thereof. 


</p>
               <p>Here for want of an apter and more naturall word to declare the drie temper 
of the earth, it is said to thirst &amp; to reioyce, which is onely proper to 
liuing creatures, and yet being so inuerted, doth not so much swerue from 
the true sence, but that euery man can easily conceiue the meaning thereof. 


</p>
               <p>Againe we vse it for pleasure and ornament of our speach, as thus in an 
Epitaph of our owne making, to the honourable memorie of a deere friend, Sir 
<hi>Iohn Throgmorton</hi>, knight, Iustice of Chester, and a man of many 
commendable <hi>vertues</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whom vertue rerde, enuy hath ouerthrowen</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And lodged full low, under this marble stone:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ne neuer were his values so well knowen,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whilest he liued here, as now that he is gone</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here these words, <hi>rered, ouerthrowen,</hi> and <hi>lodged</hi>, are inuerted, 
&amp; <hi>metaphorically</hi> applyed, not vpon necessitie, but for ornament 
onely, afterward againe in these verses. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>No sunne by day that euer saw him rest</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Free from the toyles of his so busie charge,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>No night that harbourd rankor in his breast,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor merry moode, made reason runne at large</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>In these verses the inuersion or metaphor, lyeth in these words, <hi>saw, 
harbourd, run</hi>: which naturally are applyed to liuing things, &amp; not to 
insensible: as, the <hi>sunne</hi>, or the <hi>night</hi>: &amp; yet they approch 
so neere, &amp; so conueniently, as the speech is thereby made more 
commendable. Againe, in moe verses of the same Epitaph thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>His head a source of grauitie and sence,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His memory a shop of ciuill arte:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His tongue a streame of sugred eloquence,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wisdome and meeknes lay mingled in his harte,</hi>
                  <pb n="150"/>
               </l>
               <p>In which verses ye see that these words, <hi>source, shop, stud, sugred</hi>, 
are inuerted from their owne signification to another, not altogether so 
naturall, but of much affinitie with it. 


</p>
               <p>Then also do we it sometimes to enforce a sence and make the word more 
significatiue: as thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I burne in loue, I freese in deadly hate</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I swimme in hope, and sinke in deepe dispaire</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>These examples I haue the willinger giuen you to set foorth the nature and 
vse of your figure metaphore, which of any other being choisly made, is the 
most commendable and most common. 


</p>
               <p>But if for lacke of naturall and proper terme or worde we take another, 
neither naturall nor proper and do vntruly applie it to the thing which we 
would seeme to expresse, and without any iust inconuenience, it is not then 
spoken by this figure <hi>Metaphore</hi> or of <hi>inuersion</hi> as before but by 
plaine abuse, as he that bad his man go into his library and set him his bowe 
and arrowes, for in deede there was neuer a booke there to be found, or as 
one should in reproch say to a poore man, thou raskall knaue, where 
<hi>raskall</hi> is properly the hunters terme giuen to young deere, leane 
&amp; out of season, and not to people: or as one said very pretily in this 
verse. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I lent my loue to losse, and gaged my life in vaine</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Whereas this worde <hi>lent</hi> is properly of mony or some such other thing, 
as men do commonly borrow, for vse to be repayed againe, and being applied 
to loue is vtterly abused, and yet very commendably spoken by vertue of this 
figure. For he that loueth and is not beloued againe, hath no lesse wrong, 
than he that lendeth and is neuer repayde. 


</p>
               <p>Now doth this vnderstanding or secret conceyt reach many times to the only 
nomination of persons or things in their names, as of men, or mountaines, 
seas, countries and such like, in which respect the wrong naming, or 
otherwise naming of them then is due, carieth not onely an alteration of 
sence but a necessitie of intendment figuratiuely as when we cal loue by the 
name of <hi>Venus</hi>, fleshly lust by the name of <hi>Cupid</hi>, bicause they 
were supposed by the auncient poets to be authors and kindlers of loue and 
lust: <hi>Vulcan</hi>: for fire, <hi>Ceres</hi> for bread: <hi>Bacchus</hi> for 
wine by the same reason; also if one should say to a skilfull craftesman 
knowen for a <pb n="151"/>
glutton or common drunkard, that had spent all his goods on riot and delicate 
fare. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thy hands they made thee rich, thy pallet made thee poore</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>It is ment, his trauaile and arte made him wealthie, his riotous life had 
made him a beggar: and as one that boasted of his housekeeping, said that 
neuer a yeare passed ouer his head, that he drank not in his house euery 
moneth four tonnes of beere, &amp; one hogshead of wine, meaning not the 
caskes or vessels, but that quantitie which they conteyned. These and such 
other speaches, where ye take the name of the Author for the thing it selfe, 
or the thing conteining, for that which is contained, &amp; in many other 
cases do as it were wrong name the person or the thing. So neuerthelesse as 
it may be vnderstood, it is by the figure <hi>metonymia</hi>, or misnamer. 


</p>
               <p>And if this manner of naming of persons or things be not by way of 
misnaming as before, but by a conuenient difference, and such as is true or 
esteemed and likely to be true, it is then called not <hi>metonimia</hi>, but 
<hi>antonomasia</hi>, or the Surnamer, (not the misnamer, which might extend 
to any other thing aswell as to a person) as he that would say: not king 
Philip of Spaine, but the Westerne king, because his dominion lieth the 
furdest West of any Christen prince: and the French king the great 
<hi>Vallois</hi>, because so is the name of his house, or the Queene of England, 
<hi>The maiden Queene</hi>, for that is her hiest peculiar among all the 
Queenes of the world, or as we said in one of our <hi>Partheniades</hi>, the 
<hi>Bryton mayde</hi>, because she is the most great and famous mayden of 
all Brittayne: thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>But in chaste stile, am borne as I weene</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To blazon foorth the Brytton mayden Queene</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>So did our forefathers call <hi>Henry the first, Beauclerke, Edmund Ironside, 
Richard coeur de lion: Edward the Confessor</hi>, and we of her Maiestie 
<hi>Elisabeth</hi> the peasible. 


</p>
               <p>Then also is the sence figuratiue when we deuise a new name to any thing 
consonant, as neere as we can to the nature thereof, as to say: <hi>flashing 
of lightning, clashing of blades, clinking of fetters, chinking of mony:</hi>
&amp; as the poet <hi>Virgil</hi> said of the sounding a trumpet, <hi>ta-ra-tant, 
taratantara</hi>, or as we giue special names to the voices of dombe 
beasts, as to say, a horse neigheth, a lyon brayes, a swine <pb n="152"/>
grunts, a hen cackleth, a dogge howles, and a hundreth mo such new names 
as any man hath libertie to deuise, so it be fittie for the thing which he 
couets to expresse. 


</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Epitheton</hi> or <hi>qualifier</hi>, whereof we spake before, placing 
him among the figures <hi>auricular</hi>, now because he serues also to alter 
and enforce the sence, we will say somewhat more of him in this place, and 
do conclude that he must be apt and proper for the thing he is added vnto, 
&amp; not disagreable or repugnant, as one that said: <hi>darke disdaine</hi>, 
and <hi>miserable pride</hi>, very absurdly, for disdaine or disdained things 
cannot be said darke, but rather bright and cleere, because they beholden and 
much looked vpon, and pride is rather enuied then pitied or miserable, 
vnlesse it be in Christian charitie, which helpeth not the terme in this case. 
Some of our vulgar writers take great pleasure in giuing Epithets and do it 
almost to euery word which may receiue them, and should not be so, yea 
though they were neuer so propre and apt, for sometimes wordes suffered to 
go single, do giue greater sence and grace than words quallified by 
attributions do. 


</p>
               <p>But the sence is much altered &amp; the hearers conceit strangly entangled 
by the figure <hi>Metalepsis</hi>, which I call the <hi>farfet</hi>, as when we 
had rather fetch a word a great way off then to vse one nerer hand to 
expresse the matter aswel &amp; plainer. And it seemeth the deuiser of 
this figure, had a desire to please women rather then men: for we vse to say 
by manner of Prouerbe: things farrefet and deare bought are good for Ladies: 
so in this manner of speach we vse it, leaping ouer the heads of a great 
many words, we take one that is furdest off, to vtter our matte by: as 
<hi>Medea</hi> cursing hir first acquaintance with prince <hi>Iason</hi>, who 
had very vnkindly forsaken her, said: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Woe worth the mountaine that the maste bare</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Which was the first causer of ally my care</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where she might aswell haue said, woe worth our first meeting, or woe 
worth the time that <hi>Iason</hi> arriued with his ship at my fathers cittie 
in <hi>Colchos</hi>, when he tooke me away with him, &amp; not so farre off 
as to curse the mountaine that bare the pinetree, that made the mast, that 
bare the sailes, that the ship sailed with, which caried her away. A 
pleasant Gentleman came into a Ladies nursery, <pb n="153"/>
and saw her owne pleasure rocking or her young child in the cradle, and 
sayd to her: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I speake it Madame without any mocke,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many a such cradell may I see you rocke</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Gods passion hourson said she, would thou haue me beare mo children yet, no 
<hi>Madame</hi> quoth the Gentleman, but I would haue you liue long, that ye 
might the better pleasure your friends, for his meaning was that as euery 
cradle signified a new borne childe, &amp; euery child the leasure of one 
yeares birth, &amp; many yeares a long life: so by wishing her to rocke 
many cradels of her owne, he wished her long life. <hi>Virgill</hi> said: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Post multas mea regna videns mirabor aristas</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Thus in English. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>After many a stubble shall I come</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And wonder at the sight of my kingdome</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>By stubble the Poet vnderstoode yeares, for haruests come but once euery 
yeare, at least wayes with vs in Europe. This is spoken by the figure of 
farre-set. <hi>Metalepsis</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>And one notable meane to affect the minde, is to inforce the sence of any 
thing by a word of more than ordinary efficacie, and neuertheles is not 
apparant, but as it were, secretly implyed, as he that said thus of a faire 
Lady. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>O rare beautie, ô grace, and curtesie</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And by a very euill man thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>O sinne it selfe, not wretch, but wretchednes</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Whereas if he had said thus, <hi>O gratious, courteous and beautifull 
woman</hi>: and, <hi>O sinfull and wretched man</hi>, it had bene all to one 
effect, yet not with such force and efficacie, to speake by the denominatiue, 
as by the thing it selfe. 


</p>
               <p>As by the former figure we vse to enforce our sence, so by another we 
temper our sence with wordes of such moderation, as in appearaunce it 
abateth, it but not in deede, and is by the figure <hi>Liptote</hi>, which 
therefore I call the <hi>Moderator</hi>, and becomes vs many times better to 
speake in that sort quallified, than if we spake it by more forcible termes, 
and neuertheles is equipolent in sence, thus. 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>I know you hate me not, nor wish me any ill</hi>. </l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="154"/>
Meaning in deede that he loued him very well and dearely, and yet the words 
doe not expresse so much, though they purport so much. Or if you would say, 
I am not ignorant, for I know well inough. Such a man is no foole, meaning in 
deede that he is a very wise man. 


</p>
               <p>But if such moderation of words tend to flattery, or soothing, or excusing, it 
is by the figure <hi>Paradiastole</hi>, which therfore nothing improperly we 
call the <hi>Curry-fauell</hi>, as when we make the best of a bad thing, or 
turne a signification to the more plausible sence: as, to call an vnthrift, a 
liberall Gentleman: the foolish-hardy, valiant or couragious: the niggard, 
thriftie; a great riot, or outrage, and youthfull pranke, and such like termes: 
moderating and abating the force of the matter by craft, and for a pleasing 
purpose, as appeareth by these verses of ours, teaching in what cases it may 
commendably be vsed by Courtiers. 


</p>
               <p>But if you diminish and abbase a thing by way of spight or malice, as it were 
to depraue it, such speach is by the figure <hi>Meiosis</hi> or the 
<hi>disabler</hi> spoken of hereafter in the place of <hi>sententious</hi>
figures. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>A great mountaine as bigge as a molehill,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A heauy burthen perdy, as a pound of fethers</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>But if ye abase your thing or matter by ignorance or errour in the choise of 
your word, then is it by vicious maner of speach called <hi>Tapinosis</hi>, 
whereof ye shall haue examples in the chapter of vices hereafter folowing. 


</p>
               <p>Then againe if we vse such a word (as many times we doe) by which we 
driue the hearer to conceiue more or lesse or beyond or otherwise then the 
letter expresseth, and it be not by vertue of the former figures 
<hi>Metaphore</hi> and <hi>Abase</hi> and the rest, the Greeks then call it 
<hi>Synecdoche</hi>, the Latines <hi>sub intellectio</hi> or vnderstanding, for by 
part we are enforced to vnderstand the whole, by the whole part, by many 
things one thing, by one, many, by a thing precedent, a thing consequent, and 
generally one thing out of another by maner of contrariety to the word which 
is spoken, <hi>aliud ex alio</hi>, which because it seemeth to aske a good, 
quick, and pregnant capacitie, and is not for an ordinarie or dull wit so to 
do, I chose to call him the figure not onely of conceit after the Greeke 
originall, but also of quick conceite. As for example we will giue none 
because we <pb n="155"/>
will speake of him againe in another place, where he is ranged among the 
figures <hi>sensable</hi> apperteining to clauses.

               <head>Of sensable figures altering and affecting the mynde by alteration of sence or intendements in whole clauses or speaches.</head>
               <p>As by the last remembred figures the sence of single wordes is altered, so 
by these that follow is that of whole and entier speach: and first by the 
Courtly figure <hi>Allegoria</hi>, which is when we speake one thing and 
thinke another, and that our wordes and our meanings meete not. The vse of 
this figure is so large, and has vertue of so great efficacie as it is supposed 
no man can pleasantly vtter and perswade without it, but in effect is sure 
neuer or very seldome to thriue and prosper in the world, that cannot 
skilfully put in vre, in somuch as not onely euery common Courtier, but also 
the grauest Counsellour, yea and the most noble and wisest Prince of them 
all are many times enforced to vse it, by example (say they) of the great 
Emperour who had it vsually in his mouth to say <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare 
nescit regnare</hi>. Of this figure therefore which for his duplicitie we call 
the figure of [<hi>false semblant or dissimulation</hi>] we will speake first 
as of the chief ringleader and captaine of all other figures, either in the 
Poeticall or oratorie science. 


</p>
               <p>And ye shall know that we may dissemble, I meane speake otherwise then 
we thinke, in earnest aswell as in sport, vnder couert and darke termes, and 
in learned and apparant speaches, in short sentences, and by long ambage and 
circumstance of wordes, and finally aswell when we lye as when we tell 
truth. To be short euery speach wrested from his owne naturall 
signification to another not altogether so naturall is a kinde of 
dissimulation, because the wordes beare contrary countenaunce to th'intent. 
But properly &amp; in his principall vertue <hi>Allegoria</hi> is when we do 
speake in sence translatiue and wrested from the owne signification, 
neuerthelesse applied to another not altogether contrary, but hauing much 
conueniencie with it as before we said of the metaphore: as for example if 
we should call the common wealth, a shippe; the Prince a Pilot, the 
Counsellours mariners, the stormes warres, the calme <pb n="156"/>
and [<hi>hauen</hi>] peace, this is spoken all in allegorie: and because such 
inuersion of sence in one single worde is by the figure <hi>Metaphore</hi>; of 
whom we spake before, and this manner of inuersion extending to whole and 
large speaches, it maketh the figure <hi>allegorie</hi> to be called a long and 
perpetuall Metaphore. A noble man after a whole yeares absence from his 
ladie, sent to know how she did, and whether she remayned affected toward 
him as she was when he left her. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Louely Lady I long full sore to heare,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>If ye remaine the same, I left you the last yeare</hi>. </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My louing Lorde I will well that ye wist,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The thred is spon, that neuer shall vntwist</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Meaning, that her loue was so stedfast and constant toward him as no time 
or occasion could alter it. <hi>Virgill</hi> in his shepeherdly poemes called 
<hi>Eglogues</hi> vsed as rusticall but fit <hi>allegorie</hi> for the purpose 
thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Claudite iam riuos pueri sat prata biberunt</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Which I English thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Stop up your streams (my lads) the medes haue drunk ther fill</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>As much to say, leaue of now, yee haue talked of the matter inough: for the 
shepheards guise in many places is by opening certaine sluces to water their 
pastures, so as when they are wet inough they shut them againe: this 
application is full Allegoricke. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another manner of Allegorie not full, but mixt, as he that wrate 
thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The cloudes of care haue coured all my coste,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The stormes of strife, do threaten to appeare:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The waues of woe, wherein my ship is toste.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Haue broke the banks, where lay my life so deere.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Chippes of ill chance, are fallen amidst my choise,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To marre the minde that ment for to reioyce</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>I call him not a full Allegorie, but mixt, bicause he discouers withall what 
the <hi>cloud, storme, waue</hi>, and the rest are, which in a full allegorie 
should not be discouered, but left at large to the readers iudgement and 
coniecture. 


</p>
               <p>We dissemble againe vnder couert and darke speaches, when <pb n="157"/>
we speake by way of riddle (<hi>Enigma</hi>) of which the sence can hardly be 
picked out, but by the parties owne assoile, as he that said: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>It is my mother well I wot,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And yet the daughter that I begot</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Meaning it by the ise which is made of frozen water, the same being molten 
by the sunne or fire, makes water againe. 


</p>
               <p>My mother had an old woman in her nurserie, who in the winter nights would 
put vs forth many prety ridles, whereof this is one: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I haue a thing and rough it is</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And in the midst a hole Iwis:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>There came a yong man with his ginne,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And he put it a handfull in</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The good old Gentlewoman would tell vs that were children how it was 
meant by a furd glooue. Some other naughtie body would peraduenture haue 
construed it not halfe so mannerly. The riddle is pretie but that it holdes 
too much of the <hi>Cachemphaton</hi> or foule speach and may be drawen to a 
reprobate sence. 


</p>
               <p>We dissemble after a sort, when we speake by common prouerbs, or, as we 
vse to call them, old said sawes, as thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi> As the olde cocke crowes so doeth the chick:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A bad Cooke that cannot his owne fingers lick</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Meaning by the first, that the young learne by the olde, either to be good or 
euill in their behauiours: by the second, that he is not to be counted a wise 
man, who being in authority, and hauing the administration of many good and 
great things, will not serue his own turne and his friends whilest he may, 
&amp; many such prouerbiall speeches: as <hi>Totnesse is turned French</hi>, 
for a strange alteration: <hi>Skarborow warning</hi>, for a sodaine 
commandement, allowing no respect or delay to bethinke a man of his 
busines. Note neuerthelesse a diuersitie, for the two last examples be 
prouerbs, the two first prouerbiall speeches. 


</p>
               <p>Ye doe likewise dissemble, when ye speake in derision or mockerie, &amp; 
that may be many waies: as sometime in sport, sometime in earnest, and 
priuily, and apertly, and pleasantly, and bitterly: but first by the figure 
<hi>Ironia</hi>, which we call the <hi>drye mock</hi>: as he that said to a 
bragging Ruffian, that threatened he would kill and slay, no doubt you are a 
good man of your hands: or, as it was said by <pb n="158"/>
a French king, to one that praide his reward, shewing how he had bene cut in 
the face at a certain battell fought in his seruice: ye may see, quoth the 
king, what it is to runne away &amp; looke backwards. And as 
<hi>Alphonso</hi> king of Naples, said to one that profered to take his ring 
when he washt before dinner, this wil serue another well: meaning that the 
Gentlemen had another time taken them, &amp; because the king forgot to 
aske for them, neuer restored his ring againe. 


</p>
               <p>Or when we deride with a certaine seueritie, we may call it the bitter taunt 
[<hi>Sarcasmus</hi>] as <hi>Charles</hi> the fift Emperour aunswered the Duke 
of Arskot, beseeching him recompence of seruice done at the siege of Renty, 
against <hi>Henry</hi> the French king, where the Duke was taken prisoner, and 
afterward escaped clad like a Colliar. Thou wert taken, quoth the Emperour, 
like a coward, and scapedst like a Colliar, wherefore get thee home and liue 
vpon thine owne. Or as king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight said to one of his priuy 
chamber, who sued for Sir <hi>Anthony Rowse</hi>, a knight of Norfolke that 
his Maiestie would be good vnto him, for that he was an ill begger. Quoth 
the king againe, if he be ashamed to beg, we are ashamed to geue. Or as 
<hi>Charles</hi> the fift Emperour, hauing taken in battaile <hi>Iohn 
Frederike</hi> Duke of Saxon, with the Lantgraue of Hessen and others: this 
Duke being a man of monstrous bignesse and corpulence, after the Emperor 
had seene the prisoners, said to those that were about him, I haue gone a 
hunting many times, yet neuer tooke I such a swine before. 


</p>
               <p>Or when we speake by manner of pleasantery, or mery skoffe, that is, by a 
kinde of mock, whereof the sence is farrefet, &amp; without any gall or 
offence. The Greekes call it [<hi>Asteismus</hi>] we may terme it the ciuill 
iest, because it is a mirth very full of ciuilitie, and such as the most ciuill 
men doo vse. As <hi>Cato</hi> said to one that had geuen him a good knock on 
the head with a long peece of timber he bare on his shoulder, and then bad 
him beware: what (quoth <hi>Cato</hi>) wilt thou strike me againe? for ye 
know, a warning should be geuen before a man haue receiued harme, and not 
after. And as king <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, being of young yeres, but olde in 
wit, saide to one of his priuie chamber, who sued for a pardon for one that 
was condemned for a robberie, telling the king that it was but a small 
trifle, not past sixteene shillings matter which he had taken: <pb n="159"/>
quoth the king againe, but I warrant you the fellow was sorrie it had not 
bene sixteen pound: meaning how the malefactors intent was as euill in that 
trifle, as if it had bene a greater summe of money. In these examples if ye 
marke there is no griefe or offence ministred as in those other before, and 
yet are very wittie, and spoken in plaine derision. 


</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift was a man of very few words, and 
delighted little in talke. His brother king <hi>Ferdinando</hi> being a man of 
more pleasant discourse, sitting at the table with him, said, I pray your 
Maiestie be not so silent, but let vs talke a little. What neede that brother, 
quoth the Emperor, since you haue words enough for vs both. 


</p>
               <p>Or when we giue a mocke with a scornefull countenance as in some smiling 
sort looking aside or by drawing the lippe awry, or shrinking vp the nose; the 
Greeks called it <hi>Micterismus</hi>, we may terme it a fleering frumpe, as 
he that said to one whose wordes he beleued not, not doubt Sir of that. This 
fleering frumpe is one of the Courtly graces of <hi>hicke the scorner</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Or when we druide by plaine and flat contradiction, as he that saw a dwarfe 
go in the streete said to his companion that walked with him: See yonder 
gyant: and to a Negro or woman blackemoore, in good sooth ye are a faire 
one, we may call it the broad floure. 


</p>
               <p>Or when ye giue a mocke vnder smooth and lowly wordes as he that hard one 
call him all to nought and say, thou are sure to be hanged ere thou dye: quoth 
th'other very soberly Sir I know your maistership speakes but in iest, the 
Greeks call it (<hi>charientismus</hi>) we may call it the priuy nippe, or a 
myld and appeasing mockery: all these be souldiers to the figure 
<hi>allegoria</hi> and fight vnder the banner of dissimulation. 


</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse ye haue yet two or three other figures that smatch a spice of 
the same <hi>false semblant</hi>, but in another sort and maner of phrase, 
whereof one is when we speake in the superlatiue and beyond the limites of 
credit, that is by the figure which the Greeks call <hi>Hiperbole</hi>, the 
Latines <hi>Dementiens</hi> or the lying figure. I for his immoderate excesse 
cal him the ouer reacher right with his originall or [<hi>lowd lyer</hi>] &amp; 
me thinks not amisse: now when I speake that <pb n="160"/>
which neither I my selfe thinke to be true, nor would haue any other body 
beleeue, it must needs be a great dissimulation, because I meane nothing 
lesse then that I speake, and this maner of speach is vsed, when either we 
would greatly aduance or greatly abase the reputation of any thing or 
person, and must be vsed very discreetly, or els it will seeme odious, for 
although a prayse or other report may be allowed beyond credit, it may not 
be beyond all measure, specially in the proseman, as he that was speaker in 
a Parliament of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eights raigne, in his Oration which ye 
know is or ordinary to be made before the Prince at the first assembly, of 
both houses, ould seeme to prayse his Maiestie thus. What should I go about 
to recite your Maiesties innumerable vertues, euen as much as if I tooke 
vpon me to number the starres of the skie, or to tell the sands of the sea. 
This <hi>Hyperbole</hi> was both <hi>ultra fidem</hi> and also <hi>ultra 
modum</hi>, and therefore of a graue and wise Counsellour made the speaker 
to be accompted a grosse flattering foole: peraduenture if he had vsed it 
thus, it had bene better and neuerthelesse a lye too, but a more moderate lye 
and no lesse to the purpose of the kings commendation, thus. I am not able 
with any wordes sufficiently to expresse your Maiesties regall vertues, your 
kingly merites also towardes vs your people and realme are so exceeding 
many, as your prayses therefore are infinite, your honour and renowne 
euerlasting: And yet all this if we shall measure it by the rule of exact 
veritie, is but an vntruth, yet a more cleanely commendation then was 
maister Speakers. Neuerthelesse as I said before if we fall a praysing, 
specially of our mistresses vertue, bewtie, or other good parts, we be 
allowed now and then to ouer-reach a little by way of comparison as he that 
said thus in prayse of his Lady. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Giue place ye louers here before,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That spent your boasts and braggs in vaine:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My Ladies bewtie passeth more,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The best of your I dare well fayne:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then doth the sunne the candle light,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Or brightest day the darkest night</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And as a certaine noble Gentlewoman lamenting at the vnkindnesse of her 
louer said very pretily in this figure. 
<pb n="161"/>
               </p>
               <l>
                  <hi>But since it will no better be,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My teares shall neuer blin:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To moist the earth in such degree,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That I may drowne therein:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That by my death all men may say,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lo weemen are as true as they</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Then haue ye the figure <hi>Periphrasis</hi>, holding somewhat of the 
dissembler, by reason of a secret intent not appearing by the words, as when 
we go about the bush, and will not in one or a few words expresse that thing 
which we desire to haue knowen, but do chose rather to do it by many words, 
as we our selues wrote of our Soueraigne Lady thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whom Princes serue, and Realmes obay,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And greatest of Bryton kings begot:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She came abroade euen yesterday,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>When such as saw her, knew her not</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And the rest that followeth, meaning her Maiesties person, which we would 
seeme to hide leauing her name vnspoken, to the intent the reader should 
gesse at it: neuerthelesse vpon the matter did so manifestly disclose it, as 
any simple iudgement might easily perceiue by whom it was ment, that is by 
Lady <hi>Elizabeth, Queene of England and daughter to king Henry the 
eight</hi>, and therein resteth the dissimulation. It is one of the gallantest 
figures among the poetes so it be vsed discretely and in his right kinde, but 
many of these makers that be not halfe their craftes maisters, do very often 
abuse it and also many waies. For if the thing or person they go about to 
describe by circumstance, be by the writers improuidence otherwise 
bewrayed, it looseth the grace of a figure, as he that said: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The tenth of March when Aries receiued,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Dan Phoebus raies into his horned hed</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Intending to describe the spring of the yeare, which euery man knoweth of 
himselfe, hearing the day of March named: the verses be very good the 
figure nought worth, if it were meant in Periphrase for the matter, that is 
the season of the yeare which should haue bene couertly disclosed by 
ambage, was by and by blabbed out by naming the day of the moneth, &amp; 
so the purpose of the figure disapointed, peraduenture it had bin better to 
haue said thus: 
<pb n="162"/>
               </p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The month and daie when Aries receiud,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Dan Phoebus raies into his horned head</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>For now there remaineth for the Reader somewhat to studie and gesse vpon, 
and yet the spring time to the learned iudgement sufficiently expressed. 


</p>
               <p>The Noble Earle of Surrey wrote thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>In winters iust returne, when Boreas gan his raigne,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And euery tree unclothed him fast as nature taught them plaine</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>I would faine learne of some good maker, whether the Earle spake this in 
figure of <hi>Periphrase</hi> or not, for mine owne opinion I thinke that if he 
ment to describe the winter season, he would not haue disclosed it so 
broadly, as to say winter at the first worde, for that had bene against the 
rules of arte, and without any good iudgement: which in so learned &amp; 
excellent a personage we ought not to suspect, we say therefore that for 
winter it is no <hi>Periphrase</hi> but language at large: we say for all that, 
hauing regard to the second verse that followeth it is a <hi>Periphrase</hi>, 
seeming that thereby he intended to shew in what part of the winter his 
loues gaue him anguish, that is in the time which we call the fall of the 
leafe, which begins in the moneth of October, and stands very well with the 
figure to be vttered in that sort notwithstanding winter be named before, 
for winter hath many parts: such namely as do not shake of the leafe, nor 
vncloth the trees as here is mencioned: thus may ye iudge as I do, that this 
noble Erle wrate excellently well and to purpose. Moreouer, when a maker 
will seeme to vse circumlocution to set forth any thing pleasantly and 
figuratiuely, yet no lesse plaine to a ripe reader, then if it were named 
expresly, and when all is done, no man can perceyue it to be the thing 
intended. This is a soule ouersight in any writer as did a good fellow, who 
weening to shew his cunning, would needs by periphrase expresse the realme 
of Scotland in no lesse then eight verses, and when he had said all, no man 
could imagine it to be spoken of Scotland: and did besides many other 
faultes in his verse, so deadly belie the matter by his description as it 
would pitie any good maker to heare it. 


</p>
               <p>Now for the shutting vp of this Chapter, will I remember you farther of that 
manner of speech which the Greekes call <hi>Synedcoche</hi>, and we the 
figure of [<hi>quick conceite</hi>] who for the reasons before <pb n="163"/>
alledged, may be put vnder the speeches <hi>allegoricall</hi>, because of 
the darkenes and duplicitie of his sence: as when one would tell me how the 
French king was ouerthrowen at Saint Quintans, I am enforced to think that 
it was not the king himselfe in person, but the Constable of Fraunce with 
the French kings power. Or if one would say, the towne of Andwerpe were 
famished, it is not so to be taken, but of the people of the town of Andwerp, 
and this conceit being drawen aside, and (as it were) from one thing to 
another, it encombers the minde with a certaine imagination what it may be 
that is meant, and not expressed: as he that said to a young gentlewoman, 
who was in her chamber making her selfe vnready. Mistresse will ye geue 
me leaue to vnlace your peticote, meaning (perchance) the other thing that 
might follow such vnlasing. In the olde time, whosoeuer was allowed to 
vndoe his Ladies girdle, he might lie with her all night: wherfore the taking 
of a womans maydenhead away, was said to vndoo her girdle. <hi>Virgineam 
dissoluit zonam</hi>, saith the Poet, conceiuing out of a thing precedent, a 
thing subsequent. This may suffice for the knowledge of this figure 
[<hi>quicke conceit</hi>].

            <div xml:id="c3.19" type="chapter">
               <head>Of Figures sententious, otherwise called Rhetoricall.</head>
               <p>Now it our presupposall be true, that the Poet is of all other the most 
auncient Orator, as he that by good &amp; pleasant perswasions first 
reduced the wilde and beastly people into publicke societies and ciuilitie of 
life, insinuating vnto them vnder fictions with sweete and coloured 
speeches, many wholesome lessons and doctrines, then no doubt there is 
nothing so fitte for him, as to be furnished with all the figures that be 
<hi>Rhetoricall</hi>, and such as do most beautifie language with eloquence 
&amp; sententiousnes. Therfore since we haue already allowed to our maker 
his <hi>auricular</hi> figures, and also his <hi>sensable</hi>, by which all the 
words and clauses of his meeters are made as well tunable to the eare, as 
stirring to the minde, we are now by order to bestow vpon him those other 
figures which may execute both offices, and all at once to beautifie and 
geue sence and sententiousnes to the whole language at large. So as if we 
should intreate our maker to play also the Orator, and <pb n="164"/>
whether it be to pleade, or to praise, or to aduise, that in all three cases he 
may vtter, and also perswade both copiously and vehemently. 


</p>
               <p>And your figures rhetoricall, besides their remembred ordinarie vertues, 
that is, sententiousnes, &amp; copious amplification, or enlargement of 
language, doe also conteine a certaine sweet and melodious manner of 
speech, in which respect, they may, after a sort, be said <hi>auricular</hi>: 
because the eare is no lesse rauished with their currant tune, than the mind 
is with their sententiousnes. For the eare is properly but an instrument of 
conueyance for the minde, to apprehend the sence by the sound. And our 
speech is made melodious or harmonicall, not onely by strayned tunes, as 
those of <hi>Musick</hi>, but also by choise of smoothe words: and thus, or 
thus, marshalling them in their comeliest construction and order, and 
aswell by sometimes sparing, sometimes spending them more or less 
liberally, and carrying or transporting them farther off or neerer, setting 
them with sundry relations, and variable formes, in the ministery and vse of 
words, doe breede no little alteration in man. For to say truely, what els is 
man but his minde? which, whosoeuer haue skil to compasse, and make 
yeelding and flexible, what may not he commaund the body to perfourme? He 
therefore that hath vanquished the minde of man, hath made the greatest and 
most glorious conquest. But the minde is not assailable vnlesse it be by 
sensible approches, whereof the audible is of greatest force for instruction 
or discipline: the visible, for apprehension of exterior knowledges as the 
Philosopher saith. Therefore the well tuning of your words and clauses to 
the delight of the eare, maketh your information no lesse plausible to the 
minde than to the eare: no though you filled them with neuer so much sence 
and sententiousnes. Then also must the whole tale (if it tende to 
perswasion) beare his iust and reasonable measure, being rather with the 
largest, than with the scarcest. For like as one or two drops of water perce 
not the flint stone, but many and often droppings doo: so cannot a few 
words (be they neuer so pithie or sententious) in all cases and to all manner 
of mindes, make so deepe an impression, as a more multitude of words to 
the purpose discreetely, and without superfluitie vttered: the minde being 
no lesse vanquished <pb n="165"/>
with large loade of speech, than the limmes are with heauie burden. 
Sweetenes of speech, sentence, and amplification, are therfore necessarie 
to an excellent Orator and Poet, ne may in no wise be spared from any of 
them. 


</p>
               <p>And first of all others your figure that worketh by iteration or repetition of 
one word or clause doth much alter and affect the eare and also the mynde 
of the hearer, and therefore is counted a very braue figure both with the 
Poets and rhetoriciens, and this repetition may be in seuen sortes. 


</p>
               <p>Repetition in the first degree we call the figure of <hi>Report</hi> according 
to the Greeke originall, and is when we make one word begin, and as they are 
wont to say, lead the daunce to many verses in sute, as thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>To thinke on death it is a miserie,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To thinke on life it is a vanitie,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To thinke on the world verily it is,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To thinke that heare man hath no perfit blisse</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And this written by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> of his greatest mistresse in 
most excellent verses. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>In vayne mine eyes in vaine you wast your teares,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In vayne my sighs the smokes of my despaires:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In vayne you search th'earth and heauens aboue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In vayne ye seeke, for fortune keeps my loue</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as the buffon in our enterlude called <hi>Lustie London</hi> said very 
knauishly and like himselfe. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many a faire lasse in London towne,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many a bawdie basket borne up and downe:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many a broker in a third bare gowne.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many a bankrowte scarce worth a crowne.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In London</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Ye haue another sort of repetition quite contrary to the former when ye 
make one word finish many verses in sute, and that which is harder, to 
finish many clauses in the middest of your verses or dittie (for to make 
them finish the verse in our vulgar it should hinder the rime) and because I 
do finde few of our English makers vse this figure, I haue set you down to 
two litle ditties which our selues in our yonger yeares played vpon the 
<hi>Antistrophe</hi>, for so <pb n="166"/>
is the figures name in Greeke: one vpon the mutable loue of a Lady, another 
vpon the meritorious loue of Christ our Sauiour, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her lowly lookes, that gaue life to my loue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With spitefull speach, curtnesse and crueltie:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She kild my loue, let her rigour remoue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her cherefull lights and speaches of pitie</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Reuiue my loue: anone with great disdaine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She shinnes my loue, and after by a traine</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She seekes my loue, and saith she loues me most,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But seing her loue, so lightly wonne and lost:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I longd not for her loue, for well I thought,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Firme is the loue, if it be as it ought</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The second vpon the merites of Christes passion toward mankind, thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Our Christ the sonne of God, chief authour of all good,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Was he by his allmight, that first created man:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And with the costly price, of his most precious bloud,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>He that redeemed man: and by his instance wan</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Grace in the sight of God, his onely father deare,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And reconciled man: and to make man his peere</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Made himselfe very man: brief to conclude the case,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>This Christ both God and man, he all and onely is:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The man brings man to God and to all heauens blisse</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The Greekes call this figure <hi>Antistrophe</hi>, the Latines, 
<hi>conuersio</hi>, I following the originall call him the <hi>counterturne</hi>, 
because he turnes counter in the middest of euery meetre. 


</p>
               <p>Take me the two former figures and put them into one, and it is that which 
the Greekes call <hi>symploche</hi>, the Latines <hi>complexio</hi>, or 
<hi>conduplicatio</hi>, and is a maner of repetition, when one and the selfe 
word doth begin and end many verses in sute &amp; so wrappes vp both the 
former figures in one, as he that sportingly complained of his vntrustie 
mistresse, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who made me shent for her loues sake?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Myne owne mistresse.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who would not seeme my part to take,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Myne owne mistresse.</hi>
                  <pb n="167"/>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>What made me first so well content</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her curtesie.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>What makes me now so sore repent</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her crueltie</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The Greekes name this figure <hi>Symploche</hi>, the Latins <hi>Complexio</hi>, 
perchaunce for that he seemes to hold in and to wrap vp the verses by 
reduplication, so as nothing can fall out. I had rather call him the figure of 
replie. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another sort of repetition when with the worde by which you finish 
your verse, ye beginne the next verse with the same, as thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Comforte it is for man to haue a wife,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wife chast, and wise, and lowly all her life</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Your beutie was the cause of my first loue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Looue while I liue, that I may sore repent</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The Greeks call this figure <hi>Anadiplosis</hi>, I call him the <hi>Redouble</hi>
as the originall beares. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue an other sorte of repetition, when ye make one worde both beginne 
and end your verse, which therefore I call the slow retourne, otherwise the 
Eccho, sound, as thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Much must he be beloued, that loueth much,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Feare many must he needs, whom many feare</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Vnlesse I called him the <hi>eccho sound</hi>, I could not tell what name to 
giue him, vnlesse it were the slow returne. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another sort of repetition when in one verse or clause of a verse, ye 
iterate one word without any intermission, as thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>It was Maryne, Maryne that wrought mine woe</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And this bemoaning the departure of a deere friend. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The chiefest staffe of mine assured stay,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>With no small griefe, is gon, is gon away</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And that of Sir <hi>Walter Raleighs</hi> very sweet. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>With wisdomes eyes had but blind fortune seene,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Than had my looue, my looue for euer beene</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The Greeks call him <hi>Epizeuxis</hi>, the Latines <hi>Subiunctio</hi>, we may 
call him the <hi>underlay</hi>, me thinks if we regard his manner of iteration, 
&amp; would depart from the originall, we might very properly, <pb n="168"/>
in our vulgar and for pleasure call him the <hi>cuckowspell</hi>, for right as 
the cuckow repeats his lay, which is but one manner of note, and doth not 
insert any other tune betwixt, and sometimes for hast stammers out two or 
three of them one immediatly after another, as <hi>cuck, cuck, cuckow</hi>, so 
doth the figure <hi>Epizeuxis</hi> in the former verses, <hi>Maryne, Maryne</hi>, 
without any intermission at <hi>all</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue one sorte of repetition, which we call the <hi>doubler</hi>, and is as 
the next before, a speedie iteration of one word, but with some little 
intermission by inserting one or two words betweene, as in a most excellent 
dittie written by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> these two closing verses: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Yet when I sawe my selfe to you was true,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I loued my selfe, bycause my selfe loued you</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And this spoken in common Prouerbe. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>An ape wilbe an ape, by kinde as they say,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Though that ye clad him all in purple array</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as we once sported vpon a fellowes name who was called 
<hi>Woodcock</hi>, and for an ill part he had plaid entreated fauour by his 
friend. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I praie you intreate no more for the man,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Woodcocke wilbe a woodcocke do what ye can</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Now also be there many other sortes of repetition if a man would vse them, 
but are nothing commendable, and therefore are not obserued in good poesie, 
as a vulgar rimer who doubled one word in the end of euery verse, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>adieu, adieu,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>my face, my face</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And an other that did the like in the beginning of his verse, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>To loue him and loue him, as sinners should doo</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>These repetitions be not figuratiue but phantastical, for a figure is euer 
vsed to a purpose, either of beautie or of efficacie: and these last recited 
be to no purpose, for neither can ye say that it vrges affection, nor that it 
beautifieth or enforceth the sence, nor hath any other subtiltie in it, and 
therfore is a very foolish impertinency of speech, and not a figure. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue a figure by which ye play with a couple of words or names much 
resembling, and because the one seemes to answere <pb n="169"/>
th'other by maner of illusion, and doth, as it were, nick him, I call him the 
<hi>Nicknamer</hi>. If any other man can geue him a fitter English name, I 
will not be angrie, but I am sure mine is very neere the originall sence of 
<hi>Prosonomasia</hi>, and is rather a by-name geuen in sport, that a surname 
geuen of any earnest purpose. As, <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor, because he 
was a great drinker of wine, they called him by way of derision to his owne 
name, <hi>Caldius Biberius Mero</hi>, in steade of <hi>Claudius Tiberius 
Nero</hi>: and so a iesting frier that wrate against <hi>Erasmus</hi>, called 
him by resemblance to his own name <hi>Errans mus</hi>, and are mainteined 
by this figure <hi>Prosonomasia</hi>, or the Nicknamer. But euery name geuen 
in iest or by way of a surname, if it do not resemble the true, is not by this 
figure, as the Emperor of Greece, who was surnamed <hi>Constantius 
Copronimus</hi>, because he beshit the foont at the time he was christened: 
and so ye may see the difference betwixt the figures <hi>Antonomasia &amp; 
Prosonomatia</hi>. Now when such resemblance happens betweene words of 
another nature, and not vpon mens names, yet doeth the Poet or maker finde 
prety sport to play with them in his verse, specially the Comicall Poet and 
the Epigrammatist. Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> in a dittie plaide very pretily 
with these two words, <hi>Loue and live</hi>, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>And all my life I will confesse,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The lesse I loue, I liue the lesse</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And we in our Enterlude called the woer, plaid with these two words, 
<hi>lubber</hi> and <hi>louer</hi>, thus, the countrey clowne came &amp; woed a 
young maide of the Citie, and being agreeued to come so oft, and not to haue 
his answere, said to the old nurse very impatiently. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Iche pray you good mother tell our young dame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whence I am come and what is my name,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I cannot come a woing euery day</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Quoth the nurse. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>They be lubbers not louers that so use to say</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as one replyed to his mistresse charging him with some disloyaltie 
towards her. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Proue me madame ere ye fall to reproue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Meeke mindes should rather excuse than accuse</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here the words proue and reproue, excuse and accuse, do pleasantly <pb n="170"/>
encounter, and (as it were) mock one another by their much 
resemblance: and this is by the figure <hi>Prosonomatia</hi>, as wel as if 
they were mens proper names, alluding to each other. 


</p>
               <p>Then haue ye a figure which the Latines call <hi>Traductio</hi>, and I the 
tranlacer: which is when ye turne and tranlace a word into many sundry 
shapes as the Tailor doth his garment, &amp; after that sort do play with 
him in your dittie: as thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi> Who liues in loue his life is full of feares,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To lose his loue, liuelode or libertie</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But liuely spirites that young and recklesse be,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thinke that there is no liuing like to theirs</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as one who much gloried in his owne wit, whom <hi>Persius</hi> taxes in a 
verse very pithily and pleasantly, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Scire tuum nihil est nisi te scire, hoc sciat alter</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Which I haue turned into English, not so briefly, but more at large of purpose 
the better to declare the nature of the figure: as thus, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thou weenest thy wit nought worth if other weet it not</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>As wel as thou thy selfe, but o thing well I wot,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who so in earnest weenes, he doth in mine aduise,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Shew himselfe witlesse, or more wittie than wise</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here ye see how in the former rime this word life is tranlaced into liue, 
liuing, liuely, liuelode: &amp; in the latter time this word wit is translated 
into weete, weene, wotte, witlesse, witty &amp; wise: which come all from 
one originall. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue a figuratiue speach which the Greeks cal <hi>Antipophora</hi>, I name 
him the <hi>Responce</hi>, and is when we will seeme to aske a question to 
th'intent w will aunswere it our selues, and is a figure of argument and also 
of amplification. Of argument, because proponing such matter as our 
aduersarie might obiect and then to answere it our selues, we do vnfurnish 
and preuent him of such helpe as he would otherwise haue vsed for himselfe: 
then because such obiection and answere spend much language it serues as 
well to amplifie and enlarge our tale. Thus for example. 

</p>

               <p>We read that <hi>Crates</hi> the Philosopher Cinicke in respect of the manifold 
discommodities of mans life, held opinion that is was best for man neuer to 
haue bene borne or soone after to dye, [<hi>Optimum non nasci vel cito

Englished thus.

               <p>Ye haue another figure which me thinkes may well be called (not much 
sweruing from his originall in sence) the <hi>Crosse-couple</hi>, because it 
takes me two contrary words, and tieth them as it were in a paire of 
couples, and so makes them agree like good fellowes, as I saw once in 
Fraunce a wolfe coupled with a mastiffe, and a foxe with a hounde. Thus it 
is.

               <p>Ye haue another figure which by his nature we may call the <hi>Rebound</hi>, 
alluding to the tennis ball which being smitten with the racket reboundes 
backe againe, and where the last figure before played with two wordes 
somewhat like, this playeth with one word written all alike but carrying 
diuers sences as thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The maide that soone married is, soone marred is</hi>.

</p>
               <p>Ye haue a figure which as well by his Greeke and Latine originals, &amp; also 
by allusion to the maner of a mans gate or going may be called the 
<hi>marching figure</hi>, for after the first steppe all the rest proceede by 
double the space, and so in our speach one word proceedes double to the 
first that was spoken, and goeth as it were by strides or paces: it may 
aswell be called the <hi>clyming</hi> figure, for <hi>Climax</hi> is as much to 
say as a ladder, as in one of our Epitaphes shewing how a very meane man by 
his wisedome and good fortune came to great estate and dignitie. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>His vertue made him wise, his wisedome brought him wealth,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His wealth wan many friends, his friends made much supply:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Of aides in weale and woe in sicknesse and in health,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thus came he from a low, to sit in seate so hye</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as <hi>Ihean de Mehune</hi> the French Poet.

               <l>
                  <hi>So peace brings warre, and warre brings peace</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Ye haue a figure which takes a couple of words to play with in a verse, and 
by making them to chaunge and shift one into others place they do very 
pretily exchange and shift the sence, as thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>We dwell not here to build us boures,</hi>

                  <hi>To dwell in them whilest we are here</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Meaning that we dwell not here to build, but we build to dwel, as we liue not 
to eate, but eate to liue, or thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>We wish not peace to maintaine cruell warre,</hi>
               </l>

                  <hi>But we make warre to maintaine us in peace</hi>.

               <p>A wittie fellow in Rome wrate vnder the Image of <hi>Caesar</hi> the Dictator 
these two verses in Latine, which because they are spoken by this figure of 
<hi>Counterchaunge</hi> I haue turned into a couple of English verses very 
well keeping the grace of the figure. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Brutus for casting out of kings, was first of Consuls past,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Caesar for casting Consuls out, is of our kings the last</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cato</hi> of any Senatour not onely the grauest but also the promptest an 
wittiest in any euill scoffe, misliking greatly the engrossing of offices in 
Rome that one man should haue many at once, and a great number goe 
without that were as able men, said thus by <hi>Counterchaunge</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>It seemes your offices are very litle worth,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Or very few of your worthy of offices</hi>.

               <l>
                  <hi>In earnest matters no such trifler as hee</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Ye haue another figure much like to the <hi>Sarcasmus</hi>, or bitter taunt 
wee spake of before: and is when with proud and insolent words, we do 
vpbraid a man, or ride him as we terme it: for which cause the Latines also 
call it <hi>Insultatio</hi>, I choose to name him the <hi>Reprochfull</hi> or 
<hi>scorner</hi>, as when Queene <hi>Dido</hi> saw, that for all her great loue 
an entertainements bestowed vpon <hi>Aeneas</hi>, he would needs depart, and 
follow the <hi>Oracle</hi> of his destines, she brake out in a great rage and 
said very disdainefully. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hye thee, and by the wild waues and the wind,</hi>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>If piteous Gods haue power amidst the mayne,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>On ragged rocks thy penaunce thou maist find</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as the poet <hi>Iuenall</hi> reproched the couetous Merchant, who for 
lucres sake passed on no perill either by land or sea, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Goe now and giue thy life unto the winde,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Trusting unto a piece of bruckle wood,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Foure inches from thy death or seauen good</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>The thickest planke for shipboord that we finde</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Ye haue another figure very pleasant and fit for amplification, which to 
answer the Greeke terme, we may call the encounter, but following the 
Latine name by reason of his contentious nature, we may call him the 
Quarreller, for so be al such persons as delight in taking the contrary part of 
whatsoeuer shalbe spoken: when I was a scholler in Oxford they called 
euery such one <hi>Iohannes ad oppositum</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Good haue I doone you, much, harme did I neuer none,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ready to ioy your gaines, your losses to bemone,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Why therefore should you grutch so sore at my welfare:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who onely bred your blisse, and neuer causd your care</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as it is in these verses where one speaking of <hi>Cupids</hi> bowe, 
deciphered, thereby the nature of sensual loue, whose beginning is more 
pleasant than the end, thus allegorically and by <hi>antitheton</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>His bent is sweete, his loose is somewhat sowre,</hi>

               <p>Maister <hi>Diar</hi> in this quarrelling figure.

                  <hi>Nor loue hath now the force, on me which it ones had,</hi>

so was the Spaniard that wrote the life of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>, &amp; 
many of our moderne writers in vulgar, vse it in excesse &amp; incurre the 
vice of fond affectation: otherwise the figure is very commendable. 


</p>
               <p>In this quarrelling figure we once plaid this merry Epigrame of an importune 
and shrewd wife, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>My neighbour hath a wife, not fit to make him thriue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But good to kill a quicke man, or make a dead reuiue.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So shrewd she is for God, so cunning and so wise,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To counter with her goodman, and all by contraries.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For when he is merry, she lurcheth and she loures,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>When he is sad she singes, or laughes it out by houres.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Bid her be still her tongue to talke shall neuer cease,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>When she should speake and please, for spight she holds her peace,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Bid spare and she will spend, bid spend she spares as fast,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Her husband (as I thinke) calles her ouerthwart Ione</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>There is a kinde of figuratiue speach when we aske many questions and 
looke for none answere, speaking indeed by interrogation, which we might as 
well say by affirmation. This figure I call the <hi>Questioner</hi> or 
inquisitiue, as whan <hi>Medea</hi> excusing her great crueltie vsed in the 
murder of her owne children which she had by <hi>Iason</hi>, sais:

                  <hi>And am I not able to marre them all aswell?</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Or as another wrote very commendably. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Why striue I with the streame, or hoppe against the hill,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Or search that neuer can be found, and loose my labour still?</hi>
               </l>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cato</hi> vnderstanding that the Senate had appointed three citizens of 
Rome for embassadours to the king of <hi>Bithinia</hi>, whereof one had the 
Gowte, another the Meigrim, the third very little courage or discretion to be 
employed in any such businesse, said by way of skoffe in this figure.

               </l>
               <p>The figure of exclamation, I call him [<hi>the outcrie</hi>] because it vtters 
our minde by all such words as do shew any extreme passion, whether it be by 
way of exclamation or crying out, admiration or wondering, imprecation or 
cursing, obtestation or taking God and the world to witnes, or any such like 
as declare an impotent affection, as <hi>Chaucer</hi> of the Lady

               <p>And so forth, &amp;c. 


</p>
               <p>We vse sometimes to proceede all by single words, without any close or 
coupling sauing that a little pause or comma is geuen to euery word. This 
figure for pleasure may be called in our vulgar the cutted comma, for that 
there cannot be a shorter diuision then at euery words end. The Greekes in 
their language call it short language, as thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Enuy, malice, flattery, disdaine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Auarice, deceit, falshed, filthy gaine</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>If this loose language be vsed, not in single words, but in long clauses, it is 
called <hi>Asindeton</hi>, and in both cases we vtter in that fashion, when 
either we be earnest, or would seeme to make hast. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another figure which we may call the figure of euen, because it 
goeth by clauses of egall quantitie, and not very long, but yet not so short as 
the cutted comma: and they geue good grace to a dittie, but specially to a 
prose. In this figure we once wrote in a melancholike humor these verses. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The good is geason, and short is his abode,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The bad bides long, and easie to be found:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Our life is loathsome, our sinnes a heauy lode,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Conscience a curst iudge, remorse a priuie goade.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Disease, age and death still in our care they round,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That hence we must the sickly and the sound:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Rich, poore, holy, wise, all flesh it goes to ground</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>In a prose there should not be vsed at once of such euen clauses past three 
or foure at the most.

               </p>
               <p>When so euer we multiply our speech by many words or clauses of one sence, 
the Greekes call it <hi>Sinonimia</hi>, as who would say, like or consenting 
names: the Latines hauing no fitte terme to giue him, called it by a name of 
euent, for (said they) many words of one nature and sence, one of them doth 
expound another. And therefore they called this figure the [<hi>Interpreter</hi>] 
I for my part had rather call him the figure of [<hi>store</hi>] because plenty 
of one manner of thing in our vulgar we call so. <hi>Aeneas</hi> asking whether 
his Captaine <hi>Orontes</hi> were dead or aliue, vsed this store of speeches 
all to one purpose. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Is he aliue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Is he as left him queauing and quick</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And hath he not yet geuen up the ghost,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Among the rest of those that I haue lost?</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Or if it be in single words, then thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>What is become of that beautifull face,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Those louely lookes, that fauour amiable,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Those sweete features, and visage full of grace,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That countenance which is alonly able</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>to kill and cure?</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Ye see that all these words, face, lookes, fauour, features, visage, 
countenance, are in sence but all one. Which store, neuerthelesse, doeth 
much beautifie and inlarge the matter. So said another. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>My faith, my hope, my trust, my God and eke my guide,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Stretch forth thy hand to saue the soule, what ere the body bide</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Here faith, hope and trust be words of one effect, allowed to vs by this 
figure of store. 


</p>
               <p>Otherwhiles we speak and be sorry for it, as if we had not wel spoken, so 
that we seeme to call in our word againe, and to pur in another fitter for the 
purpose: for which respects the Greekes called this manner of speech the 
figure of repentance: then for that vpon repentance commonly followes 
amendment, the Latins called it the figure of correction, in that the speaker 
seemeth to reforme that which was said amisse. I following the Greeke 
originall, choose to call him the penitent, or repentant: and singing in honor 
of the mayden Queen, meaning to praise her for her greatnesse of courage, 
ouershooting my selfe, called it first by the name <pb n="180"/>
of pride: then fearing least fault might be found with that terme, by &amp; by 
turned this word pride to praise: resembling her Maiesty to the Lion, being 
her owne noble armory, which by a slie construction purporteth 
magnanimitie. Thus in the latter end of a Parthemiade. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>O peereles you, or els no one aliue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Your pride serues you to feaze them all alone:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Not pride madame, but praise of the lion,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To conquer all and be conquerd by none</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And in another Parthemiade thus insinuating her Maiesties great constancy 
in refusall of all marriages offred her, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her heart is hid none may it see,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Marble or flinte folke weene it be</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>By which is intended, that it proceeded of a cold and chast complexion not 
easily allured to loue. 


</p>
               <p>We haue another manner of speech much like to the <hi>repentant</hi>, but doth 
not as the same recant or vnsay a word that hath bene said before, putting 
another fitter in his place, but hauing spoken any thing to depraue the 
matter or partie, he denieth it not, but as it were helpeth it againe by 
another more fauourable speach: and so seemeth to make amends, for which 
cause it is called by the originall name in both languages, the 
<hi>Recompencer</hi>, as he that was merily asked the question, whether his 
wife were not a shrewe as well as others of his neighbours wiues, answered 
in this figure as pleasantly, for he could not well denie it. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I must needs say, that my wife is a shrewe,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But such a huswife as I know but a fewe</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>another in his first preposition giuing a very faine commendation to the 
Courtiers life, weaning to make him amends, made it worse by a second 
proposition, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Courtiers life full delicate it is,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But where no wise man will euer set his blis</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And an other speaking to the incoragement of youth in studie and to be come 
excellent in letters and armes, said thus: 
<pb n="181"/>
               </p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many are the paines and perils to be past,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But great is the gaine and glory at the last</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Our poet in his short ditties, but specially playing the Epigrammatist will 
vse to conclude and shut vp his Epigram with a verse or two, spoken in such 
sort, as it may seeme a manner of allowance to all the premisses, and that 
with a ioyfull approbation, which the Latines call <hi>Acclamatio</hi>, we 
therefore call this figure the <hi>surcloze</hi> or <hi>consenting close</hi>, as 
<hi>Virgill</hi> when he had largely spoken of Prince <hi>Eneas</hi> his successe 
and fortunes concluded with this close. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tantae molis erat Romanum condere gentem</hi>.

               <p>And we in a <hi>Partheniade</hi> written of her Maiestie, declaring to what perils 
vertue is generally subiect, and applying that fortune to her selfe, closed it 
vp with this <hi>Epiphoneme</hi>.

abuses of the superstitious religion of the Gentils, and recompting the 
wicked fact of king <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in sacrificing his only daughter 
<hi>Iphigenia</hi>, being a yoong damsell of excellent bewtie, to th'intent to 
please the wrathfull gods, hinderers of his nauigation, after he had said all, 
closed it vp in this one verse, spoken in <hi>Epiphonema</hi>.

</l>
               <p>It happens many times that to vrge and enforce the matter we speake of, we 
go still mounting by degrees and encreasing our speech with wordes or with 
sentences of more waight one then another, &amp; is a figure of great both 
efficacie &amp; ornament, as he that declaring the great calamitie of an 
infortunate prince, said thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>He lost besides his children and his wife,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His realme, ronowne, liege, libertie and life</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>By which it appeareth that to any noble Prince the losse of his estate ought 
not to be so greeuous, as of his honour, nor any of them both like to the 
lacke of his libertie, but that life is the dearest detriment of any other. We 
call this figure by the Greeke originall the <hi>Auancer</hi> or figure of 
encrease because euery word that is spoken is one of more weight then another. 


</p>
               <p>And as we lamented the crueltie of an inexorable and vnfaithfull mistresse.

                  <hi>Then for to flea me quicke, or strip me being dead</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>In these verses you see how one crueltie surmounts another by degrees till 
it come to very slaughter and beyond, for it is thought a despite done to a 
dead carkas to be an euidence of greater crueltie then to haue killed him. 


</p>
               <p>After the auancer followeth the abbaser working by wordes and sentences of 
extenuation or diminution. Whereupon we call him the <hi>Disabler</hi> of 
figure of <hi>Extenuation</hi>: and this extenuation is vsed to diuers purposes, 
sometimes for modesties sake, and to auoide the opinion of arrogancie, 
speaking of our selues or of ours, as he that disabled himselfe to his 
mistresse, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Not all the skill I haue to speake or do,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Which litle is God wot (set loue apart:)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Liue load nor life, and put them both thereto,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Can counterpeise the due of your desart</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>It may be also done for despite to bring our aduersaries on contempt, as he 
that sayd by one (commended for a very braue souldier) disabling him 
scornefully, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>A iollie man (forsooth) and fit for the warre,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Good at hand grippes, better to fight a farre:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whom bright weapon in shew as it is said,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Yea his owne shade, hath often made afraide</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The subtiltie of the scoffe lieth in these Latine wordes [<hi>eminui &amp; 
cominus pugnare</hi>.] Also we vse this king of Extenuation when we take in hand to 
comfort or cheare any perillous enterprise, making a great matter seeme 
small, and of litel difficultie, &amp; is much vsed by captaines in the warre, 
when they (to giue courage to their souldiers) will seeme to disable the 
persons of their enemies, and abase their forces, and make light of euery 
thing that might be a discouragement to the attempt, as <hi>Hanniball</hi> did 
in his Oration to his souldiers, when they should come to passe the Alpes to 
enter <pb n="184"/>
Italie, and for sharpnesse of the weather, and steepnesse of the 
mountaines their hearts began to faile them. 


</p>
               <p>We vse it againe to excuse a fault, &amp; to make an offence seeme lesse 
then it is, by giuing a terme more fauorable and of lesse vehemencie then the troth 
requires, as to say of a great robbery, that it was but a pilfry matter: of an 
arrant ruffian that he is a tall fellow of his hands: of a prodigall foole, that 
he is a kind hearted man: of a notorious vnthrift, a lustie youth, and such 
like phrases of extenuation, which fall more aptly to the office of the figure 
<hi>Curry fauell</hi> before remembred. 


</p>
               <p>And we vse the like termes by way of pleasant familiaritie, and as it were 
for a Courtly maner of speach with our egalls or inferiours, as to call a 
young Gentlewoman <hi>Mall</hi> for <hi>Mary</hi>, <hi>Nell</hi> for <hi>Elmer</hi>: 
<hi>Iack</hi> for 
<hi>Iohn</hi>, <hi>Robin</hi> for <hi>Robert</hi>: or any other like affected termes 
spoken of pleasure, as in our triumphals calling familiarly vpon our 
<hi>Muse</hi>, I called her <hi>Moppe</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>But will you weet,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My litle msue, my prettie moppe:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>If we shall algates change our stoppe,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Chose me a sweet</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Vnderstanding by this word [<hi>Moppe</hi>[ a litle prety Lady, or tender young 
thing. For so we call litle fishes that be not come to their full growth 
[<hi>moppes,</hi>] as whiting moppes, gurnard moppes. 


</p>
               <p>Also such termes are vsed to be giuen in derision and for a kind of contempt, 
as when we say Lording for Lord, &amp; as the Spaniard that calleth an Earle of 
small reuenue <hi>Contadilo</hi>: the Italian calleth the poore man, by contempt 
<hi>pouerachio</hi>, or <hi>pouerino</hi>, the little beast <hi>animalculo</hi> or 
<hi>animaluchio</hi>, and such like <hi>diminutiues</hi> apperteining to this figure, 
the [<hi>Disabler</hi>] more ordinary in other languages than in our vulgar. 


</p>
               <p>This figure of retire holds part with the propounder of which we spake 
before (<hi>prolepsis</hi>) because of this resumption of a former proposition 
vttered in generalitie to explane the same better by a particular diuision. 
But their difference is, in that the propounder resumes but the matter only. 
This [<hi>retire</hi>] resumes both the matter and the termes, and is therefore 
accompted one of the figures of repetition, and in that respect may be called 
by his originall <pb n="185"/>
Greeke name the [<hi>Resounde</hi>] or the [<hi>retire</hi>] for this word 
[<foreign xml:lang="el">odos</foreign>] serues both sences resound and 
retire. The vse of this figure, is seen in this dittie following. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Loue hope and death, do stirre in me much strife,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>As neuer man but I lead such a life:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For burning loue doth wound my heart to death:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And when death comes at call of inward grief,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cold lingring hope doth feede my fainting breath:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Against my will, and yeelds my wound relief,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So that I liue, but yet my life is such:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>As neuer death could greeue me halfe so much</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Then haue ye a maner of speach, not so figuratiue as fit for argumentation, 
and worketh not vnlike the <hi>dilemma</hi> of the Logicians, because he 
propones two or moe matters entierly, and doth as it were set downe the 
whole tale or rekoning of an argument and then cleare euery part by it selfe, 
as thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>It can not be but nigardship or neede,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Made him attempt this foule and wicked deede:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nigardship not, for alwayes he was free,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor neede, for who doth not his richesse see?</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Or as one that entreated for a faire young maide who was taken by the watch 
in London and carried to Bridewell to be punished. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Now gentill Sirs let this young maide alone,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For either she hath grace or els she hath none:</hi>

                  <hi>If she haue none what bootes her punishment</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as another pleaded his deserts with his mistresse. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Were it for grace, or els in hope of gaine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To say of my deserts, it is but vaine:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For well in minde, in case ye do them beare,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To tell them oft, it should but irke your eare:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Be they forgot: as likely should I faile,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To winne with wordes, where deedes can not preuaile</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The haue ye a figure very meete for Orators or eloquent perswaders such as 
our maker or Poet must in some cases she whim selfe to be, and is when we 
may conueniently vtter a matter in one <pb n="186"/>
entier speach or proposition and will rather do it peecemeale and by 
distribution of euery part for amplification sake, as for example he that 
might say, a house was outragiously plucked downe: will not be satisfied so 
to say, but rather will speake it in this sort: they first vndermined the 
groundsills, they beate downe the walles, they vnfloored the loftes, they 
vntiled, it and pulled downe the roofe. For so in deede is a house pulled 
downe by circumstances, which this figure of distribution doth set forth 
euery one apart, and therefore I name him the <hi>distributor</hi> according to 
his originall, as wrate the <hi>Tuscane</hi> Poet in a Sonet which Sir 
<hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> translated with very good grace, thus.

               <p>This figure serues for amplification, and also for ornament, and to enforce 
perswasion mightely. Sir <hi>Geffrey Chaucer</hi>, father of our English 
Poets, hath these verses following in the distributor. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>When faith failes in Priestes sawes,</hi>

                  <hi>And Lords hestes are holden for lawes,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And robberie is tane for purchase,</hi>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then shall the Realme of Albion</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Be brought to great confusion</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where he might haue said as much in these words: when vice abounds, and 
vertue decayeth in Albion, then &amp;c. And as another said, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>When Prince for his people is wakefull and wise,</hi>
               </l>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>People prest to obey, nor let to runne at large,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Prelate of holy life, and with deuotion</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Preferring pietie before promotion,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Priest still preaching, and praying for our heale:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then blessed is the state of a common-weale</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>All which might haue bene said in these few words, when euery man in 
charge and authoritie doeth his duety, &amp; executeth his function well, 
then is the common-wealth happy. 


</p>
               <p>The Greeke Poets who made musicall ditties to be song to the lute or harpe, 
did vse to linke their staues together with one verse running throughout the 
whole song by equall distance, and was, for the most part, the first verse of 
the staffe, which kept so good sence and conformitie with the whole, as his 
often repetition did geue it greater grace. They called such linking verse 
<hi>Epimone</hi>, the Latines <hi>versus intercalaris</hi>, and we may terme 
him the 
Loue-burden, following the originall, or if it please you, the long repeate: in 
one respect because that one verse alone beareth the whole burden of the 
song according to the originall: in another respect, for that it comes by 
large distances to be often repeated, as in this ditty made by the noble 
knight Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>My true loue hath my heart and I haue his,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>By iust exchange one for another geuen:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I holde his deare, and mine he cannot misse,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>There neuer was a better bargaine driuen.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My true loue hath my heart and I haue his.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My heart in me keepes him and me in one,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My heart in him his thoughts and sences guides:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>He loues my heart, for once it was his owne,</hi>
                  <pb n="189"/>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I cherish his because in me it bides.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My true loue hath my heart, and I haue his</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Many times our Poet is caried by some occasion to report of a thing that is 
maruelous, and then he will seeme not to speake it simply but with some 
signe of admiration, as in our enterlude called the <hi>Woer</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I woonder much to see so many husbands thriue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That haue but little wit, before they come to wiue:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For one would easily weene who so hath little wit,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His wife to teach it him, were a thing much vnfit</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or as <hi>Cato</hi> the Romane Senatour said one day merily to his companion 
that walked with him, pointing his finger to a yong vnthrift in the streete 
who lately before had sold his patrimonie, of a goodly quantitie of salt 
marshes, lying neere vnto <hi>Capua</hi> shore. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Now is it not, a wonder to behold,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Yonder gallant skarce twenty winter old,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>By might (marke ye) able to doo more?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Than the mayne sea that batters on his shore?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For what the waues could neuer wash away,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>This proper youth hath wasted in a day</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Not much vnlike the <hi>wondrer</hi> haue ye another figure called the 
<hi>doubtfull</hi>, because oftentimes we will seeme to cast perils, and make 
doubt of things when by a plaine manner of speech wee might affirme or 
deny him, as thus of a cruell mother who murdred her owne child. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whether the cruell mother were more to blame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Or the shrewd childe come of so curst a dame:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Or whether some smatch of the fathers blood,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whose kinne were neuer kinde, nor neuer good.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mooued her thereto, &amp;c</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>This manner of speech is vsed when we will not seeme, either for manner 
sake or to auoid tediousnesse, to trouble the iudge or hearer with all that 
we coudl say, but hauing said inough already, we referre the rest to their 
consideration, as he that said thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Me thinkes that I haue said, what may well suffise,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Referring all the rest, to your better aduise</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The fine and subtill perswader when his intent is to sting his <pb n="190"/>
aduersary, or els to declare his mind in broad and liberal speeches, which 
might breede offence or scandall, he will seeme to bespeake pardon before 
hand, whereby his licentiousnes may be the better borne withall, as he that 
said: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>If my speech hap t'offend you any way,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thinke it their fault, that force me so to say</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Not much vnlike to the figure of <hi>reference</hi>, is there another with some 
little diuersitie which we call the <hi>impartener</hi>, because many times in 
pleading and perswading, we thinke it a very good policie to acquaint our 
iudge or hearer or very aduersarie with some part of our Counsell and 
aduice, and to aske their opinion, as who would say they could not otherwise 
thinke of the matter then we do. As he that had tolde a long tale before 
certaine noble women, of a matter somewhat in honour touching the Sex. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tell me faire Ladies, if the case were your owne,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So foule a fault would you haue it be knowen?</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Maister <hi>Gorge</hi> is this figure, said very sweetly. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>All you who read these lines and skanne of my desart,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Iudge whether was more good, my hap or els my hart.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>The good Orator vseth a manner of speach in his perswasion and is when all 
that should seeme to make against him being spoken by th'otherside, he will 
first admit it, and in th'end auoid all for his better aduantage, and this 
figure is much vsed by our English pleaders in the Starchamber and 
Chancery, which they call to confesse and auoid, if it be in case of crime or 
iniury, and is a very good way. For when the matter is so plaine that it 
cannot be denied or trauersed, it is good that it be iustified by confessall 
and auoidance. I call it the figure of <hi>admittance</hi>. As we once wrate 
to the reproofe of a Ladies faire but crueltie. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I know your witte, I know your pleasant tongue,</hi>

                  <hi>Your some sweete smiles, your some, but louely lowrs:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A beautie to enamour olde and yong.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Those chast desires, that noble minde of yours,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And that chiefe part whence all your honor springs,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A grace to entertaine the greatest kings.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>All this I know: but sinne it is to see,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So faire partes spilt by too much crueltie</hi>. <pb n="191"/>
               </l>
               <p>In many cases we are driuen for better perswasion to tell the cause that 
mooues vs to say thus or thus: or els when we would fortifie our 
allegations by rendring reasons to euery one, this assignation of cause the 
Greekes called <hi>Etiologia</hi>, which if we might without scorne of a new 
inuented terme call [<hi>Tellcause</hi>] it were right according to the Greeke 
originall: &amp; I pray you why should we not? and with as good authoritie as 
the Greekes? Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>, her Maiesties principall Secretary, and 
a man of great learning and grauitie, seeking to geue an English word to this 
Greeke word <foreign xml:lang="el">agamw</foreign> called it Spitewed, or 
wedspite. Master Secretary <hi>Wilson</hi> geuing an English name to his arte of 
Logicke, called it <hi>Witcraft</hi>, me thinke I may be bolde with like liberty to 
call the figure <hi>Etiologia</hi> [<hi>Tell cause</hi>.] And this manner of 
speech is alwayes contemned, with these words, for, because, and such other 
confirmatiues. The Latines hauing no fitte name to geue it in one single 
word, gaue it no name at all, but by circumlocution. We also call him the 
reason-rendrer, and leaue the right English word [<hi>Tel cause</hi>] much better 
answering the Greeke originall. <hi>Aristotle</hi> was most excellent in vse of 
this figure, for he neuer propones any allegation, or makes any surmise, but 
he yeelds a reason or cause to fortifie and proue it, which geues it great 
credit. For example ye may take these verses, first pointing, than 
confirming by similitudes. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>When fortune shall haue spit out all her gall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I trust good luck shall be to me allowde,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For I haue seene a shippe in hauen fall,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Good is the thing that moues vs to desire,</hi>

                  <hi>Alwaies burning and euer chill a colde</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And in these verses. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I, Accused though I be without desart,</hi>

</l>
               <p>And in this other dittie of ours where the louer complaines of his Ladies 
crueltie, rendring for euer surmise a reason, and by telling the cause, 
seeketh (as it were) to get credit, thus. 

</p>
               <l>

</l>
               <p>Sometimes our error is so manifest, or we be so hardly prest with our 
aduersaries, as we cannot deny the fault layd vnto our charge: in which case 
it is good pollicie to excuse it by some allowable pretext, as did one whom 
his mistresse burdened with some vnkinde speeches which he had past of 
her, thus.

</l>
               <p>Speaking before of the figure [<hi>Synecdoche</hi>] wee call him <pb n="193"/>
[<hi>Quicke conceit</hi>] because he iniured in a single word onely by way of 
intendment or large meaning, but such as was speedily discouered by euery 
quicke wit, as by the halfe to vnderstand the whole, and many other waies 
appearing by the examples. But by this figure [<hi>Noema</hi>] the obscurity of 
the sence lieth not in a single word, but in an entier speech, whereof we do 
not so easily conceiue the meaning, but as it were by coniecture, because it 
is wittie and subtile or darke, which makes me therefore call him in our 
vulgar the [<hi>Close conceit</hi>] as he that said by himselfe and his wife, I 
thanke God in fortie winters that we haue liued together, neuer any of our 
neighbours set vs at one, meaning that they neuer fell out in all that space, 
which had bene the directer speech and more apert, and yet by intendment 
amounts all to one, being neuerthelesse dissemblable and in effect contrary. 
<hi>Pawlet</hi> Lord Treasorer of England, and first Marques of Winchester, with 
the like subtill speech gaue a quippe to Sir <hi>William Gyfford</hi>, who had 
married the Marques sister, and all her life time could neuer loue her nor 
like of her company, but when she was dead made the greatest moane for her 
in the world, and with teares and much lamentation vttered his griefe to the 
L. Treasorer, ô good brother quoth the Marques, I am right sory to see 
you now loue my sister so well, meaning that he shewed his loue too late, 
and should haue done it while she was a liue. 


</p>
               <p>A great counsellour somewhat forgetting his modestie, vsed these words: 
Gods lady I reckon my selfe as good a man as he you talke of, and yet I am 
not able to do so. Yea sir quoth the party, your L. is too good to be a man, I 
would ye were a Saint, meaning he would he were dead, for none are shrined 
for Saints before they be dead. 


</p>
               <p>The Logician vseth a definition to expresse the truth or nature of euery 
thing by his true kinde and difference, as to say wisedome is a prudent and 
wittie foresight and consideration of humane or worldly actions with their 
euentes. This definition is Logicall. The Oratour vseth another maner of 
definition, thus: Is this wisedome? no it is a certaine subtill knauish 
craftie wit, it is no industrie as ye call it, but a certaine busie 
brainsicknesse, for industrie is a liuely and vnweried search and occupation 
in honest <pb n="194"/>
things, egernesse is an appetite in base and small matters. 


</p>
               <p>It serueth many times to great purpose to preuent our aduersaries 
arguments, and take vpon vs to know before what our iudge or aduersary or 
hearer thinketh, and that we will seeme to vtter it before it be spoken or 
alleaged by them, in respect of which boldnesse to enter so deepely into 
another mans conceit or conscience, and to be so priuie of another mans 
mynde, gaue cause that this figure was called the [<hi>presumptuous</hi>]. I will 
also call him the figure of <hi>presupposall</hi> or the <hi>preuenter</hi>, for by 
reason we suppose before what may be said or perchaunce would be said by 
our aduersary or any other, we do preuent them of their aduantage, and do 
catch the ball (as they are wont to say) before it come to the ground. 


</p>
               <p>It is also very many times vsed for a good pollicie in pleading or perswasion 
to make wise as if we set but light of the matter, and that therefore we do 
passe it ouer lightly when in deede we do then intend most effectually and 
despightfully if it be inuectiue to remember it: It is also when we will not 
seeme to know a thing, and yet we know it well inough, and may be likened 
to the maner of women, who as the common saying is, will say nay and take it. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I hold my peace and will not say for shame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The much vntruth of that vnciuill dame:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For if I should her coullours kindly blaze,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>It would so make the chast eares amaze. &amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>It is said by maner of a pouerbiall speach that he who findes himselfe well 
should not wagge, euen so the perswader finding a substantiall point in his 
matter to serue his purpose, should dwell vpon that point longer then vpon 
any other lesse assured, and vse all endeuour to maintaine that one, &amp; 
as it were to make his chief aboad thereupon, for which cause I name him the 
figure of aboad, according to the Latin name: Some take it not but for a 
course of argument &amp; therefore hardly may one giue any examples thereof. 


</p>
               <p>Now as arte and good pollicy in perswasion bids vs to abide &amp; not to 
stirre from the point of our most aduantage, but the same to enforce and 
tarry vpon with all possible argument, so doth discretion will vs sometimes 
to flit from one matter to another, as a thing meete to be forsaken, and 
another entred vpon, I call him therefore the <hi>flitting</hi> figure, or figure 
of <hi>remoue</hi>, like as the other <pb n="195"/>
before was called the figure of <hi>aboade</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>Euen so againe, as it is wisdome for a perswader to tarrie and make his 
aboad as long as he may conueniently without tediousnes to the hearer, vpon 
his chiefe proofes or points of the cause tending to his aduantage, and 
likewise to depart againe when time serues, and goe to a new matter 
seruing the purpose aswell. So is it requisite many times for him to talke 
farre from the principall matter, and as it were to range aside, to th'intent 
by such extraordinary meane to induce or inferre other matter, aswell or 
better seruing the principal purpose, and neuertheles in season to returne 
home where he first strayed out. This maner of speech is termed the figure 
of digression by the Latines, following the Greeke originall, we also call 
him the <hi>straggler</hi> by allusion to the souldier that marches out of his 
array, or by those that keepe no order in their marche, as the battailes well 
ranged do: of this figure there need be geuen no example. 


</p>
               <p>Occasion offers many times that our maker as an oratour, or perswader, or 
pleader should go roundly to worke, and by a quick and swift argument 
dispatch his perswasion, &amp; as they are woont to say not to stand all day 
trifling to no purpose, but to rid it out of the way quickly. This is done by a 
manner of speech, both figuratiue and argumentatiue, when we do briefly set 
downe all our best reasons seruing the purpose, and reiect all of them 
sauing one, which we accept to satisfie the cause: as he that in a litigious 
case for land would prooue it not the aduersaries, but his clients. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>No man can say its his by heritage,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor by Legacie, or Testatours deuice:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor that it came by purchase or engage,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor from his Prince for any good seruice.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then needs must it be his by very wrong,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Which he hath offred this poore plaintife so long</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Though we might call this figure very well and properly the [<hi>Paragon</hi>] 
yet dare I not so to doe for feare of the Courtiers enuy, who will haue no man 
vse that terme but after a courtly manner, that is, in praysing of horses, 
haukes, hounds, pearles, diamonds, rubies, emerodes, and other precious 
stones: specially of faire women whose excellencie is discouered by 
paragonizing or setting one to <pb n="196"/>
another, which moued the zealous Poet, speaking of the mayden Queene, to 
call her the paragon of Queenes. This considered, I will let our figure enioy 
his best beknowen name, an call him stil in all ordinarie cases the figure of 
comparison: as when a man wil seeme to make things appeare good or bad, 
or better or worse, or more or lesse excellent, either vpon spite or for 
pleasure, or any other good affection, then he sets the lesse by the greater, 
or the greater to the lesse, the equall to his equall, and by such confronting 
of them together, driues out the true ods that is betwixt them, and makes it 
better appeare, as when we sang of our Soueraigne Lady thus, in the 
twentieth Partheniade.

                  <hi>In mine from euery other Queene</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>We are sometimes occasioned in our tale to report some speech from 
another mans mouth, as what a king said to his priuy counsell or subiect, a 
captaine to his souldier, a souldiar to his captaine, a man to a woman, and 
contrariwise: in which report we must alwaies geue to euery person his fit 
and naturall, &amp; that which best becommeth him. For that speech becommeth 
a king which doth not a carter, and a young man that doeth not an old: an so 
in euery sort and degree. <hi>Virgil</hi> speaking in the person of <hi>Eneas, 
Turnus</hi>
                  <pb n="197"/>
and many other great Princes, and sometimes of meaner men, ye shall 
see what decencie euery of their speeches holdeth with the qualitie, degree 
and yeares of the speaker. To which examples I will for this time referre you. 


</p>
               <p>So if by way of fiction we will seem to speake in another mans person, as if 
king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight were aliue, and should say of the towne of Bulleyn, 
what we by warre to the hazard of our person hardly obteined, our young 
sonne without any peril at all, for litle mony deliuered vp againe. Or if we 
should faine king <hi>Edward</hi> the thirde, vnderstanding how his successour 
Queene <hi>Marie</hi> had lost the towne of Calays by negligence, should say: 
That which the sword wanne, the distaffe hath lost. This manner of speech 
is by the figure <hi>Dialogismus</hi>, or the right reasoner. 


</p>
               <p>In waightie causes and for great purposes, wise perswaders vse graue &amp; 
weighty speaches, specially in matter of aduise or counsel, for which 
purpose there is a maner of speach to alleage textes or authorities of wittie 
sentence, such as smatch morall doctrine and teach wisedome and good 
behauiour, by the Greeke originall we call him the <hi>directour</hi>, by the 
Latin he is called <hi>sententia</hi>: we may call him the <hi>sage sayer</hi>, 
thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nature bids vs as a louing mother,</hi>

                  <hi>Where vertues force, can cause her to obay</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Heede must be taken that such rules or sentences be choisly made and not 
often vsed least excesse breed lothsomnesse. 


</p>
               <p>Arte and good pollicie moues vs many times to be earnest in our speach, and 
then we lay on such load and so go to it by heapes as if we would winne the 
game by multitude of words &amp; speaches, not all of one but of diuers 
matter and sence, for which cause the <pb n="198"/>
Latines called it <hi>congeries</hi> and we the <hi>heaping figure</hi>, as he 
that said 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>To must in minde how faire, how wise, how good,</hi>

                  <hi>My Lady is doth but inflame my blood</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Or thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I deeme, I dreame, I do, I tast, I touch,</hi>

                  <hi>Nothing at all but smells of perfit blisse</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And thus by maister <hi>Edward Diar</hi>, vehement swift &amp; passionatly.

               <l>

               </l>
               <p>But if such earnest and hastie heaping vp of speaches be made by way of 
recapitulation, which commonly is in the end of euery long tale and Oration, 
because the speaker seemes to make a collection of all the former materiall 
points, to binde them as it were in a bundle and lay them forth to enforce 
the cause and renew the hearers memory, then ye may geue him more 
properly the name of the [<hi>collectour</hi>] or recapitulatour, and serueth to 
very great purpose as in an hympne written by vs to the Queenes Maiestie 
entitled (<hi>Minerua</hi>) wherein speaking of the mutabilitie of fortune in the 
case of all Princes generally, wee seemed to exempt her Maiestie of all such 
casualtie, by reason she was by her destinie and many diuine partes in her, 
ordained to a most long and constant prosperitie in this world, concluding 
with this recapitulation.

                  <hi>Some rufull turne, of her unsteady wheele</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Many times when we haue runne a long race in our tale spoken to the 
hearers, we do sodainly flye out &amp; either speake or exclaime <pb n="199"/>
at some other person or thing, and therefore the Greekes call such 
figure (as we do) the turnway or turnetale, &amp; breedeth by such exchaunge a 
certaine recreation to the hearers minds, as this vsed by a louer to his 
vnkind mistresse. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>And as for you (faire one) say now by proofe ye finde,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That rigour and ingratitude soone kill a gentle minde</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And as we in our triumphals, speaking long to the Queenes Maiestie, vpon the 
sodaine we burst out in an exclamation to <hi>Phebus</hi>, seeming to draw in 
a new matter, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>But O Phebus,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>All glistering in thy gorgious gowne,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wouldst thou wit safe to slide a downe:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And dwell with vs,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But for a day,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I could tell thee close in thine eare,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A tale that thou hadst leuer heare</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I dare well say:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then ere thou wert,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To kisse that vnkind runne away,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who was transformed to boughs of bay:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For her curst hert. &amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>And so returned againe to the first matter. 


</p>
               <p>The matter and occasion leadeth vs many times to describe and set foorth 
many things, in such sort as it should appeare they were truly before our 
eyes though they were not present, which to do it requireth cunning: for 
nothing can be kindly counterfait or represented in his absence, but by great 
discretion in the doer. And if the things we couet to describe be not 
naturall or nor veritable, than yet the same axeth more cunning to do it, 
because to faine a thing that neuer was nor is like to be, proceedeth of a 
greater wit and sharper inuention than to describe things that be true. 


</p>
               <p>And these be things that a poet or maker is woont to describe sometimes as 
true or naturall, and sometimes to faine as artificiall and not true. 
<hi>viz</hi>. 
The visage, speach and countenance of any person absent or dead: and this 
kinde of representation is called the Counterfait countenance: as 
<hi>Homer</hi>
doth in his <hi>Ilades</hi>, diuerse <pb n="200"/>
personages: namely <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Thersites</hi>, according to the 
truth 
and not by fiction. And as our poet <hi>Chaucer</hi> doth in his Canterbury 
tales 
set forth the Sumner, Pardoner, Manciple, and the rest of the pilgrims, most 
naturally and pleasantly. 


</p>
               <p>But if ye wil faine any person with such features, qualities &amp; 
conditions, or 
if ye wil attribute any humane quality, as reason or speech to dombe 
creatures or other insensible things, &amp; do study (as one may say) to giue 
them a humane person, it is not <hi>Prosopographia</hi>, but 
<hi>Prosopopeia</hi>, 
because it is by way of fiction, &amp; no prettier examples can be giuen to 
you 
thereof, than in the Romant of the rose translated out of French by 
<hi>Chaucer</hi>, describing the persons of auarice, enuie, old age, and many 
others, whereby much moralitie is taught. 


</p>
               <p>So if we describe the time or season of the yeare, as winter, summer, 
haruest, day, midnight, noone, euening, or such like: we call such 
description the counterfait time. <hi>Cronographia</hi> examples are euery 
where to be found. 


</p>
               <p>And if this description be of any true place, citie, castell, hill, valley or 
sea, &amp; such like: we call it the counterfait place <hi>Topographia</hi>, or 
if ye 
fayne places vntrue, as heauen, hell, paradise, the house of fame, the pallace 
of the sunne, the denne of sheepe, and such like which ye shall see in Poetes: 
so did <hi>Chaucer</hi> very well describe the country of <hi>Saluces</hi> in 
<hi>Italie</hi>, 
which ye may see, in his report of the Lady <hi>Gryfyll</hi>. 


</p>
               <p>But if such description be made to represent the handling of any busines 
with the circumstances belonging therevnto as the manner of a battell, a 
feast, a marriage, a buriall or any other matter that lieth in feat and 
actiuitie: we call it then the counterfait action [<hi>Pragmatographia</hi>]. 


</p>
               <p>In this figure the Lord <hi>Nicholas Vaux</hi> a noble gentleman, and much 
delighted in vulgar making, &amp; a man otherwise of no great leaning but 
hauing 
herein a maruelous facilitie, made a dittie representing the battayle and 
assault of <hi>Cupide</hi>, so excellently well, as for the gallant and propre 
application of his fiction in euery part, I cannot choose but set downe the 
greatest part of his ditty, for in truth it can not be amended. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>When Cupid scaled first the fort,</hi>
               </l>

                  <hi>Wherein my hart lay wounded sore</hi>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The battrie was of such a sort,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That I must yeeld or die therefore.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>There saw I loue vpon the wall,</hi>

                  <hi>Eche peece discharging a louers looke, &amp;c</hi>. 

</l>
               <p> As well to a good maker and Poet as to an excellent perswader in prose, the 
figure of <hi>Similitude</hi> is very necessary, by which we not onely bewtifie 
our tale, but also very much inforce &amp; inlarge it. I say inforce because no 
one thing more preuaileth with all ordinary iudgements than perswasion by 
<hi>similitude</hi>. Now because there are sundry sorts of them, which also do 
worke after diuerse fashions in the hearers conceits, I will set them all 
foorth by a triple diuision, exempting the generall <hi>Similitude</hi> as their 
common Auncestour, and I will cal him by the name of <hi>Resemblance</hi>
without any addition, from which I deriue three other sorts: and giue euery 
one his particular name, as <hi>Resemblance</hi> by Pourtrait or Imagery, 
which the Greeks call <hi>Icon, Resemblance</hi> morall or misticall, which they call 
<hi>Parabola, &amp; Resemblance</hi> by example, which they call <hi>Paradigma</hi>, 
and first we will speake of the generall <hi>resemblance</hi>, or bare 
<hi>similitude</hi>, which may be thus spoken. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>But as the watrie showres delay the raging wind,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So doeth good hope cleane put away dispare out of my mind</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And in this other likening the forlorne louer to a striken deere. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then as the striken deere, withdrawes himselfe alone,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So do I seeke some secret place, where I may make my mone</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And in this of ours where we liken glory to a shadow. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>As the shadow (his nature beyng such,)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Followeth the body, whether it will or no,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So doeth glory, refuse it nere so much,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wait on vertue, be it in weale or wo.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And euen as the shadow in his kind,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>What time it beares the carkas company,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Goth oft before, and often comes behind:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So doth renowme, that raiseth vs so hye,</hi>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But the glory, that growth not ouer fast,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Is euer great, and likeliest long to last</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Againe in a ditty to a mistresse of ours, where we likened the cure of Loue 
to <hi>Achilles</hi> launce.

                  <hi>Is bread a wise seruant where euer he wonne</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And in these, likening the wise man to the Giant, the fool to the Dwarfe. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>See the Giant deepe in a dale, the dwarfe vpon an hill,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Yet will the one be but a dwarfe, th'other a giant still.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So will the wise be great and high, euen in the lowest place:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The focle when he is most aloft, will seeme but low and base</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>But when we liken an humane person to another in countenaunce, stature, 
speach or other qualitie, it is not called bare resemblance, but resemblaunce 
by imagerie or pourtrait, alluding to the painters terme, who yeldeth to 
th'eye a visible representation of the thing he describes and painteth in his 
table. So we commending her Maiestie for wisedome bewtie and 
magnanimitie likened her to the Serpent, the Lion and the Angell, because by 
common vsurpation, nothing is wiser then the Serpent, more couragious then 
the Lion, more bewtifull then the Angell. These are our verses in the end of 
the seuenth <hi>Partheniade</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nature that seldome workes amisse,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In womans brest by passing art:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hath lodged safe the Lyons hart,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And feately fixt with all good grace,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To Serpents head an Angels face</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And this maner of resemblaunce is not onely performed by likening of liuely 
creatures one to another, but also of any other naturall thing, bearing a 
proportion of similitude, as to liken yealow to gold, white to siluer, red to 
the rose, soft to silke, hard to the stone and such like. Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>
in the description of his mistresse excellently well handled this figure of 
resemblaunce by imagerie, as ye may see in his booke of <hi>Archadia</hi>: and 
ye may see the like, of our doings, in a <hi>Partheniade</hi> written of our 
soueraigne Lady, wherein we resemble euery part of her body to some 
naturall thing of excellent perfection in his kind, as of her forehead, browes 
and haire, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Of siluer was her forehead hye,</hi>
               </l>

                  <hi>Frizled and fine as fringe of gold</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And of her lips.

</l>
               <p>And of her breasts. 

</p>
               <l>

</l>
               <p>And all the rest that followeth, which may suffice to exemplifie your figure 
of <hi>Icon</hi>, or resemblance by imagerie and portrait. 


</p>
               <p>But when soeuer by your similitude ye will seeme to teach any moralitie or 
good lesson by speeches misticall and darke, or farre sette, vnder a sence 
metaphoricall applying one naturall thing to another, or one case to another, 
inferring by them a like consequence in other cases the Greekes call it 
<hi>Parabola</hi>, which terme is also by custome accepted of vs: neuerthelesse 
we may call him in English the resemblance misticall: as when we liken a 
young childe to a greene twigge which ye may easilie bende euery way ye 
list: or an old man who laboureth with continuall infirmities, to a drie and 
dricksie oke. Such parables were all the preachings of Christ in the Gospell, 
as those of the wise and foolish virgins, of the euil steward, of the 
labourers in the vineyard, and a number more. And they may be fayned 
aswell as true: as those fables of <hi>Aesope</hi>, and other apologies 
inuented for doctrine sake by wise and graue men. 


</p>
               <p>Finally, if in matter of counsell or perswasion we will seeme to liken one 
case to another, such as passe ordinarily in mans affaires, and doe compare 
the past with the present, gathering probabilitie of like successe to come in 
the things wee haue presently in hand: or if ye will draw the iudgements 
precedent and authorized by antiquitie as veritable, and peraduenture fayned 
and imagined for some purpose, into similitude or dissimilitude with our 
present actions and affaires it is called resemblance by example: as if one 
should say thus, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great in his expedition to Asia did 
thus, so did <hi>Hanniball</hi> comming into Spaine, so did <hi>Caesar</hi>
                  <pb n="206"/>
in Egypt, therfore all great Captains &amp; Generals ought to doe it. 


</p>
               <p>And thus againe, It hath bene alwayes vsuall among great and magnanimous 
princes in all ages, not only to repulse any iniury &amp; inuasion from their 
owne realmes and dominions, but also with a charitable &amp; Princely 
compassion to defend their good neighbors Princes and Potentats, from all 
oppression of tyrants &amp; vsurpers. So did the Romaines by their armes 
restore many Kings 
of Asia and Affricke expulsed out of their kingdoms. So did K. <hi>Edward</hi>
I. restablish <hi>Baliol</hi> rightfull owner of the crowne of Scotland against 
<hi>Robert le brus</hi> no lawfull King. So did king <hi>Edward</hi> the third 
aide <hi>Dampecter</hi> king of Spaine against <hi>Henry</hi> bastard and 
vsurper. So haue many English Princes holpen with their forces the poore 
Dukes of Britaine their ancient frends and allies, against the outrages of the 
French kings: and why may not the Queene our soueraine Lady with like 
honor and godly zele yeld protection to the people of the Low countries, her 
neerest neighbours to rescue them a free people from the Spanish seruitude. 


</p>
               <p>And as this resemblance is of one mans action to another, so may it be made 
by examples of bruite beasts, aptly corresponding in qualitie or euent, as 
one that wrote certaine prety verses of the Emperor <hi>Maximinus</hi>, to 
warne him that he should not glory too much in his owne strength, for so he 
did in very deede, and would take any common souldier to taske at 
wrastling, or weapon, or in any other actiuitie and feates of armes, which 
was by the wiser sort misliked, these were the verses. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Elephant is strong, yet death doeth it subdue,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The bull is strond, yet cannot death eschue.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Lion strong, and slaine for all his strength:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Tygar strong, yet kilde is at the length.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Dread thou many, that dreadest not any one,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many can kill, that dreadest not any one,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Many can kill, that cannot kill alone</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And so it fell out, for <hi>Maximinus</hi> was slaine in a mutinie of his 
souldiers, taking no warning by these examples written for his admonition.

               <head>The last and principall figure of our poeticall Ornament.</head>
               <p>For the glorious lustre it setteth vpon our speech and language, the Greeks 
call is [<hi>Exargasia</hi>] the Latine [<hi>Expolitio</hi>] a terme <pb n="207"/>

rough hewen &amp; reduced to that fashion they will, do set vpon it a goodly

fareth by the bare and naked body, which being attired in rich and gorgious 
apparell, seemeth to the common vsage of th'eye much more comely &amp; 
bewtifull then the naturall. So doth this figure (which therefore I call the 
<hi>Gorgious</hi>) polish our speech &amp; as it were attire it with copious 
&amp; pleasant amplifications and much varietie of sentences all running 
vpon one point &amp; to one intent: so as I doubt whether I may terme it a 
figure, or rather a masse of many figuratiue speaches, applied to the 
bewtifying of our tale or argument. In a worke of ours entituled 
<hi>Philocalia</hi> we haue strained to shew the vse &amp; application of this 
figure and all others mentioned in this booke, to which we referre you. I 
finde none example in English meetre, so well maintayning this figure as 
that dittie of her Maiesties owne making passing sweete and harmonicall, 
which figure beyng as his very originall name purporteth the most bewtifull 
and gorgious of all others, it asketh in reason to be reserued for a last 
complement, and desciphred by the arte of a Ladies penne, her selfe beyng 
the most bewtifull, or rather bewtie of Queenes. And this was the occasion: 
our soueraigne Lady perceiuing how by the Sc. Q. residence within this 
Realme at so great libertie and ease (as were skarce meete for so great and 
daungerous a prysoner) bred secret factions among her people, and made 
many of the nobilitie incline to fauour her partie: some of them desirous of 
innouation in the state: others aspiring to greater fortunes by her libertie 
and life. The Queene our soueraigne Lady to declare that she was nothing 
ignorant of those secret practizes, though she had long with great wisdome 
and pacience dissembled it, writeth this ditty most sweet and sententious, 
not hiding from all such aspiring minds the daunger of their ambition and 
disloyaltie: which afterward fell out most truly by th'exemplary 
chastisement of sundry persons, who in fauour of the sayd Sc. Q. declining 
from her Maiestie, sought to interrupt the quiet of the Realme by many euill 
and vndutifull Practizes. The ditty is as followeth.

               <head>Of the vices or deformities in speach and writing principally noted by auncient Poets.</head>
               <p>It hath bene said before how by ignorance of the maker a good figure may 
become a vice, and by his good discretion, a vicious speach go for a vertue in 
the Poeticall science. This saying is to be explaned and qualified, for some 
maner of speaches are alwayes intollerable and such as cannot be vsed with 
any decencie, but are euer vndecent namely barbarousnesse, incongruitie, ill 
disposition, fond affectation, rusticitie, and all extreme darknesse, such as 
it is not possible for a man to vnderstand the matter without an 
interpretour, all which partes are generall t be banished out of euery 
langage, vnlesse it may appeare that the maker or Poet do it for the nonce, 
as it was reported by the Philosopher <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that he wrote in 
obscure and darker termes of purpose not to be vnderstood, whence he 
merited the nickname <hi>Scotinus</hi>, otherwise I see not but the rest of 
the common faultes may be borne with <pb n="209"/>
sometimes, or passe without any great reproofe, not being vsed ouermuch or 
out of season as I said before: so as euery surplusage or preposterous 
placing or vndue iteration or darke word, or doubtfull speach are not so 
narrowly to be looked vpon in a large poeme, nor specially in the pretie 
Poesies and deuises of Ladies, and Gentlewomen makers, whom we would 
not haue too precise Poets least with their shrewd wits, when they were 
maried they might become a little to phantasticall wiues, neuerthelesse 
because we seem to promise an arte, which doth not iustly admit any wilful 
errour in the teacher, and to th'end we may not be carped at by these 
methodicall men, that we haue omitted any necessary point in this 
businesse to be regarded, I will speake somewhat touching these viciosities 
of language particularly and briefly, leauing no little to the Grammarians 
for maintenaunce of the scholasticall warre, and altercations: we for our 
part condescending in this deuise of ours, to the appetite of Princely 
personages &amp; other so tender &amp; quesie complexions in Court, as are 
annoyed with nothing more then long lessons and ouermuch good order.

               <p>The foulest vice in language is to speake barbarously: this terme grew by 
the great pride of the Greekes and Latines, when they were dominatours of 
the world reckoning no language so sweete and ciuill as their owne, and that 
all nations beside them selues were rude and vnciuill, which they called 
barbarous: So as when any straunge word not of the naturall Greeke or Latin 
was spoken, in the old time they called it <hi>barbarisme</hi>, or when any of 
their owne naturall wordes were sounded and pronounced with straunge and 
ill shapen accents, or written by wrong ortographie, as he that would say 
with vs in England, a dousand for a thousand, isterday, for yesterday, as 
commonly the Dutch and French people do, they said it was barbarously 
spoken. The Italian at this day by like arrogance calleth the Frenchman,

Tramountani</hi>, as who would say Barbarous. This terme being then so 
vsed by the auncient Greekes, there haue bene since, notwithstanding who 
haue digged for the Etimologie somewhat deeper, and many of them haue 
said that it was spoken by the rude and barking language of the AFfricans 
now called Barbarians, who had great trafficke with the Greekes and 
Romanes, but that can not be so, for that part of Affricke hath but of late 
receiued the name of Burbarie, and some others rather thinke that of this 
word Barbarous, that countrey came to be called <hi>Barbaria</hi> and but few 
yeares in respect agone. Others among whom is <hi>Ihan Leon</hi> a Moore of 
<hi>Granada</hi>, will seeme to deriue <hi>Barbaria</hi>, from this word 
<hi>Bar</hi>, twise iterate thus <hi>Barbar</hi>, as much to say as flye, flye, 
which chaunced in a persecution of the Arabians by some seditious 
Mahometanes in the time of their Pontif. <hi>Habdul mumi</hi>, when they 
were had in the chase, &amp; driuen out of Arabia Westward into the 
countreys of <hi>Mauritania</hi>, &amp; during the pursuite cried one vpon 
another flye away, flye away, or passe passe, by which occasion they say, 
when the Arabians which were had in chase came to stay and settle them 
selues in that part of Affrica, they called it <hi>Barbar</hi>, as much to say, 
the region of their flight or pursuite. Thus much for the terme, though not 
greatly pertinent to the matter, yet not vnpleasant to know for them that 
delight in such niceties. 


</p>
               <p>Your next intollerable vice is <hi>solecismus</hi> or incongruitie, as when we 
speake false English, that is by misusing the <hi>Grammaticall</hi> rules to be 
obserued in cases, genders, tenses and such like, euery poore scholler 
knowes the fault &amp; cals it the breaking of <hi>Priscians</hi> head, for he 
was among the Latines a principall Grammarian. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another intollerable ill maner of speach, which by the Greekes 
originall we may call <hi>fonde affectation</hi>, and is when we affect new 
words and phrases other then the good speakers and writers in any language, 
or the custome hath allowed, &amp; is the common fault of young schollers 
not 
halfe well studied before they come from the Vniuersitie or schooles, and 
when they come to their friends, or happen to get some benefice or other 
promotion in their countreys, will seeme to coigne fine wordes out of the 
Latin, and to vse new fangled speaches, thereby to shew themselues among 
the ignorant the better learned. 


</p>
               <p>Another of your intollerable vices is that which the Greekes call 
<hi>Soraismus</hi>, &amp; we may call the [<hi>mingle mangle</hi>] as when we 
make our 
speach or writinges of sundry languages vsing some Italian word, or French, 
or Spanish, or Dutch, or Scottish, not for the nonce or for any purpose (which 
were in part excusable) but ignorantly and affectedly as one that said vsing 
this French word <hi>Roy</hi>, to make ryme with another verse, thus. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>O mightie Lord or ioue, dame Venus onely ioy,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Whose Princely power exceedes ech other heauenly roy</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>The verse is good but the terme peeuishly affected. 


</p>
               <p>Another of reasonable good facilitie in translation finding certaine of the 
hymnes of <hi>Pyndarus</hi> and of <hi>Anacreons odes</hi>, and other 
<hi>Lirickes</hi>
among the Greekes very well translated by <hi>Rounsard</hi> the French Poet, 
&amp; 
applied to the honour of a great Prince in France, comes our minion and 
translates the same out of French into English, and applieth them to the 
honour of a great noble man in England (wherein I commend his reuerent 
minde and duetie) but doth so impudently robbe the French Poet both of his 
prayse and also of his French termes, that I cannot so much pitie him as be 
angry with him for his iniurious dealing (our sayd maker not being ashamed 
to vse these French wordes <hi>freddon, egar, superbous, filanding, celest, 
calabrois, thebanois</hi> and a number of others, for English wordes, which 
haue no maner of conformitie with our language either by custome or 
deriuation which may make them tollerable. And in the end (which is worst 
of all) makes his vaunt that neuer English finger but his hath toucht 
<hi>Pindars</hi> string which was neuerthelesse word by word as 
<hi>Rounsard</hi>
had said before by like braggery. These his verses. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>And of an ingenious inuention, infanted with pleasant trauaile</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Whereas the French word is <hi>enfante</hi> as much to say borne as a child, 
in 
another verse he saith. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I will freddon in thine honour</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>For I will shake or quiuer my fingers, for so in French is <hi>freddon</hi>, and 
in another verse. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>But if I will thus like pindar,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In many discourses egar</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>This word <hi>egar</hi> is as much to say as to wander or stray out of <pb n="212"/>
the way, which in our English is not receiued, not these wordes <hi>calabrois, 
thebanois</hi>, but rather <hi>calabrian, theban</hi> [<hi>filanding sisters</hi>] 
for the 
spinning sisters: this man deserues to be endited of pety <hi>larceny</hi> for 
pilfring other mens deuises from them &amp; conuerting them to his owne 
vse, 
for in deede as I would wish euery inuentour which is the very Poet to receaue 
the prayses of his inuention, so would I not haue a translatour be ashamed to 
be acknowen of his translation. 


</p>
               <p>Another of your intollerable vices is ill disposition or placing of your words 
in a clause or sentence: as when you will place your adiectiue after your 
substantiue, thus: <hi>Mayde faire, widow riche, priest holy</hi>, and such 
like, 
which though the Latines did admit, yet our English did not, as one that said 
ridiculously. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>In my yeares lustie, many a deed doughtie did I</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>All these remembred faults be intollerable and euer vndecent. 


</p>
               <p>Now haue ye other vicious manners of speech, but sometimes and in some 
cases tollerable, and chiefly to the intent to mooue laughter, and to make 
sport, or to giue it some prety strange grace, and is when we vse such 
wordes as may be drawen to a foule and vnshamefast sence, as one that 
would say to a young woman, <hi>I pray you let me iape with you</hi>, which in 
deed is no more but let me sport with you. Yea and though it were not 
altogether so directly spoken, the very sounding of the word were not 
commendable, as he that in the presence of Ladies would vse this common 
Prouerbe, 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Iape with me but hurt me not,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Bourde with me but shame me not</hi>. </l>
                  </q>



               </p>
               <p>For it may be taken in another peruerser sence by that sorte of persons that 
heare it, in whose eares no such matter ought almost to be called in 
memory, this vice is called by the Greekes <hi>Cacemphaton</hi>, we call it the 
vnshamefast or figure of foule speech, which our courtly maker shall in any 
case shunne, least of a Poet he become a Buffon or rayling companion, the 
Latins called him <hi>Scurra</hi>. There is also another sort of ilfauoured 
speech 
subiect to this vice, but resting more in the manner of the ilshapen sound 
and accent, than for the matter it selfe, which may easily be auoyded in 
choosing your wordes those that bee of the pleasantest orthography, and not 
to rime too many like sounding words together. 
<pb n="213"/>

               </p>
               <p>Ye haue another manner of composing your metre nothing commendable, 
specially if it be too much vsed, and is when our maker takes too much 
delight to fill his verse with wordes beginning with a letter, as an English 
rimer that said: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The deadly droppes of darke disdaine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Do daily drench my due desartes</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And as the Monke we spake of before, wrote a whole Poeme to the honor of 
<hi>Carolus Caluus</hi>, euery word in his verse beginning with C, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Carmina clarisonae Caluis cantate camenae</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Many of our English makers vse it too much, yet we confesse it doth not ill 
but pretily becomes the meetre, if ye passe not two or three words in one 
verse, and vse it not very much, as he that said by way of <hi>Epithete</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The smoakie sights: the trickling teares</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>And such like, for such composition makes the meetre runne away smoother, 
and passeth from the lippes with more facilitie by iteration of a letter then 
by alteration, which alteration of a letter requires an exchange of ministery 
and office in the lippes, teeth or palate, and so doth not the iteration. 


</p>
               <p>Your misplacing and preposterous placing is not all one in behauiour of 
language, for the misplacing is alwaies intollerable, but the preposterous is 
a pardonable fault, and many times giues a pretie grace vnto the speech. We 
call it by a common saying to <hi>set the carte before the horse</hi>, and it 
may 
be done, eyther by a single word or by a clause of speech: by a single word 
thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>And if I not performe, God let me neuer thriue</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>For performe not: and this vice is sometime tollerable inough, but if the 
word carry any notable sence, it is a vice not tollerable, as he that said 
praising a woman for her red lippes, thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>A corrall lippe of hew</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Which is no good speech, because either he should haue sayd no more but a 
corrall lip, which had bene inough to declare the rednesse, or els he should 
haue said, a lip of corrall hew, and not a corrall lip of hew. Now if this 
disorder be in a whole clause which carieth more sentence then a word, it is 
then worst of all. 


</p>
               <p>Ye haue another vicious speech which the Greekes call <hi>Acyron</hi>, <pb n="214"/>
we call it the <hi>vncouthe</hi>, and is when we vse an obscure and darke 
word, 
and vtterly repugnant to that we would expresse, if it be not by vertue of 
the figures <hi>metaphore, allegorie, abusion</hi>, or such other laudable 
figure 
before remembred, as he that said by way of <hi>Epithete</hi>. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>A dongeon deepe, a dampe as darke as hell</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Where it is euident that a dampe being but a breath or vapour, and not to be 
discerned by the eye, ought not to haue this <hi>epithete</hi> (<hi>darke</hi>,) no 
more 
then another that praysing his mistresse for her bewtifull haire, said very 
improperly and with an vncouth terme. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Her haire surmounts Apollos pride,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In it such bewty raignes</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Whereas this word <hi>raigne</hi> is ill applied to the bewtie of a womans 
haire, 
and might better haue bene spoken of her whole person, in which bewtie, 
fauour, and good grace, may perhaps in some sort be said to raigne as our 
selues wrate, in a <hi>Partheniade</hi> praising her Maiesties countenance, 
thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>A cheare where loue and Maiestie do raigne,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Both milde and sterne, &amp;c</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>Because this word Maiestie is a word expressing a certain Soueraigne 
dignitie, as well as a quallitie of countenance, and therefore may properly 
be said to <hi>raigne</hi>, &amp; requires no meaner a word to set him sooth 
by. So it 
is not of the bewtie that remaines in a womans haire, or in her hand or any 
other member: therfore when ye see all these improper or harde Epithets 
vsed, ye may put them in the number of [<hi>vncouths</hi>] as one that said, 
<hi>the 
flouds of graces</hi>: I haue heard of <hi>the flouds of teares</hi>, and <hi>the 
flouds 
of eloquence</hi>, or of any thing that may resemble the nature of a water-course, 
and in that respect we say also, <hi>the streames of teares</hi>, and 
<hi>the 
streames of vtterance</hi>, but not <hi>the streames of graces</hi>, or of 
<hi>beautie</hi>. Such manner of vncouth speech did the Tanner of Tamworth 
vse 
to king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, which <hi>Tanner</hi> hauing a great while 
mistaken him, and vsed very broad talke with him, at length perceiuing by 
his traine that it was the king, was afraide he should be punished for it, said 
thus with a certain rude repentance. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I hope I shall be hanged to morrow</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>For [<hi>I feare me</hi>] <hi>I shall be hanged</hi>, whereat the king laughed a <pb n="215"/>
good, not only to see the Tanners feare, but also to heare his ill shapen 
terme, and gaue him for recompence of his good sport, the inheritance of 
Plumton parke, I am afraid the Poets of our time that speake more finely and 
correctly will come too short of such a reward. 


</p>
               <p>Also the Poet or makers speech becomes vicious and vnpleasant by nothing 
more than by vsing too much surplusage: and this lieth not only in a word or 
two more than ordinary, but in whole clauses, and peraduenture large 
sentences impertinently spoken, or with more labour and curiositie than is 
requisite. The first surplusage the Greekes call <hi>Pleonasmus</hi>, I call 
him 
[<hi>too full speech</hi>] and is no great fault, as if one should say, <hi>I heard 
it with mine eares, and saw it with mine eyes</hi>, as if a man could heare with 
his heeles, or see with his nose. We our selues vsed this superfluous speech 
in a verse written of our mistresse, neuertheles, not much to be misliked, 
for euen a vice sometime being seasonably vsed, hath a pretie grace, 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>For euer may my true loue liue and neuer die</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And that mine eyes may see her crownde a Queene</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>As, if she liued euer she could euer die, or that one might see her crowned 
without his eyes. 


</p>
               <p>Another part of surplusage is called <hi>Macrologia</hi>, or long language, 
when 
we vse large clauses or sentences more than is requisite to the matter: it 
is also named by the Greeks <hi>Perissologia</hi>, as he that said, the 
Ambassadours after they had receiued this answere at the kings hands, they 
tooke their leaue and returned home into their countrey from whence they 
came. 


</p>
               <p>So said another of our rimers, meaning to shew the great annoy and 
difficultie of those warres of Troy, caued for <hi>Helenas</hi> sake. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nor Menelaus was vnwise,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Or troupe of Troians mad,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>When he with them and they with him,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For her such combat had</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>These clauses (<hi>be with them and they with him</hi>) are surplusage, and 
one 
of them very impertinent, because it could not otherwise be intended, but 
that <hi>Menelaus</hi>, fighting with the Troians, the <pb n="216"/>
Troians must of necessitie fight with him. 


</p>
               <p>Another point of surplusage lieth not so much in superfluitie of your words, 
as of your trauaile to describe the matter which yee take in hand, and that 
ye ouer-labour your selfe in your businesse. And therefore the Greekes call 
it <hi>Periergia</hi>, we call it ouer-labor, iumpe with the originall: or rather 
[<hi>the curious</hi>] for his ouermuch curiositie and studie to shew himselfe 
fine in a light matter, as one of our late makers, who in most of his things 
wrote very well, in this (to mine opinion) more curiously than needed, the 
matter being ripely considered: yet is his verse very good, and his meetre 
cleanly. His intent was to declare how vpon the tenth day of March he 
crossed the riuer of Thames, to walke in Saint <hi>Georges</hi> field, the 
matter 
was not great as ye may suppose. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>The tenth of March when Aries receiued</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Dan Phoebus raies into his horned head,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And I my selfe by learned lore perceiued</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That Ver approcht and frosty winter fled</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I crost the Thames to take the cheerefull aire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In open fields, the weather was so faire</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>First, the whole matter is not worth all this solemne circumstance to 
describe the tenth day of March, but if he had left at the two first verses, it 
had bene inough. But when he comes with two other verses to enlarge his 
description, it is not only more than needes, but also very ridiculous, for he 
makes wise, as if he had not bene a man learned in some of the 
mathematickes (by learned lore) that he could not haue told that the x. of 
March had fallen in the spring of the yeare: which euery carter, and also 
euery child knoweth without any learning. Then also, when he saith [<hi>Ver 
approcht, and frosty winter fled</hi>] though it were a surplusage (because 
one 
season must needes geue place to the other) yet doeth it well inough passe 
without blame in the maker. These, and a hundred more of such faultie and 
impertinent speeches may yee finde amongst vs vulgar Poets, when we be 
carelesse of our doings. 


</p>
               <p>It is no small fault in a maker to vse such wordes and termes as do diminish 
and abbase the matter he would seeme to set forth, by imparing the dignitie, 
height vigour or maiestie of the cause he takes in hand, as one that would 
say king <hi>Philip</hi> shrewdly harmed <pb n="217"/>
the towne of <hi>S. Quintaines</hi>, when in deede he wanne it and put it to 
the 
sacke, and that king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight made spoiles in <hi>Turwin</hi>, 
when as 
in deede lie did more then spoile it, for he caused it to be defaced and razed 
flat to the earth, and made it inhabitable. Therefore the historiographer 
that should by such wordes report of these two kings gestes in that behalfe, 
should greatly blemish the honour of their doings and almost speake vntruly 
and iniuriously by way of abbasement, as another of our bad rymers that 
very indecently said. 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>A misers mynde thou hast, thou hast a Princes pelfe</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>A lewd terme to be giuen to a Princes treasure (<hi>pelfe</hi>) and was a 
little 
more manerly spoken by <hi>Seriant Bendlowes</hi>, when in a progresse time 
comming to salute the Queene in Huntingtonshire he said to her cochman, 
stay thy cart good fellow, stay thy cart, that I may speake to the Queene, 
whereat her Maiestie laughed as she had bene tickled, and all the rest of the 
company although very graciously (as her manner is) she gaue him great 
shankes and her hand to kisse. These and such other base wordes do greatly 
disgrace the thing &amp; the speaker of writer: the Greekes call it 
[<hi>Tapinosis</hi>] we the [<hi>abbaser</hi>]. 


</p>
               <p>Others there be that fall into the contrary vice by vsing such bombasted 
wordes, as seeme altogether farced full of winde, being a great deale to 
high and loftie for the matter, whereof ye may finde too many in all popular 
rymers. 


</p>
               <p>Then haue ye one other vicious speach with which we will finish this 
Chapter, and is when we speake or write doubtfully and that the sence may 
be taken two wayes, such ambiguous termes they call <hi>Amphibologia</hi>, 
we 
call it the <hi>ambiguous</hi>, or figure of sence incertaine, as if one should 
say 
<hi>Thomas Tayler</hi> saw <hi>William Tyler</hi> dronke, it is indifferent to 
thinke 
either th'one or th'other dronke. Thus said a gentleman in our vulgar pretily 
notwithstanding because he did it not ignorantly, but for the nonce 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I sat by my Lady soundly sleeping,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My mistresse lay by me bitterly weeping</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>No man can tell by this, whether the mistresse or the man, slept or wept: 
these doubtfull speaches were vsed much in the old times by their false 
Prophets as appeareth by the Oracles of <hi>Delphos</hi> and <pb n="218"/>
of the <hi>Sybilles</hi> prophecies deuised by the religious persons of those 
dayes to abuse the superstitious people, and to encomber their busie braynes 
with vaine hope or vaine feare. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luciannus</hi> the merry Greeke reciteth a great number of them, deuised 
by 
a coosening companion one <hi>Alexander</hi>, to get himselfe the name and 
reputation of the God <hi>Aesculapius</hi>, and in effect all our old, Brittish 
and 
Saxon prophesies be of the same sort, that turne them on which side ye will, 
the matter of them may be verified, neuerthelesse carryeth generally such 
force in the heades of fonde people, that by the comfort of those blind 
prophecies many insurrections and rebellions haue bene stirred vp in this 
Realme, as that of <hi>Iacke Straw, &amp; Iacke Cade</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi>
the seconds 
time, and in our time by a seditious fellow in Norffolke calling himself 
Captaine Ket and others in other places of the Realme lead altogether by 
certaine propheticall rymes, which might be constred two or three wayes as 
well as to that one whereunto the rebelles applied it, our maker shall 
therefore auoyde all such ambiguous speaches vnlesse it be when he doth it 
for the nonce and for some purpose.

               <head>What it is that generally makes our speach well pleasing &amp; commendable, and of that which the Latines call Decorum.</head>
               <p>In all things to vse decencie, is it onely that giueth euery thing his good 
grace &amp; without which nothing in mans speach could seeme good or 
gracious, 
in so much as many times it makes a bewtifull figure fall into a deformitie, 
and on th'other side a vicious speach seeme pleasaunt and bewtifull: this 
decencie is therfore the line &amp; leuell for al good makers to do their 
busines 
by. But herein resteth the difficultie, to know what this good grace is, 
&amp; 
wherein it consisteth, for peraduenture it be easier to conceaue then to 
expresse, we wil therfore examine it to the bottome &amp; say: that euery 
thing 
which pleaseth the mind or sences, &amp; the mind by the sences as by 
means 
instrumentall, doth it for some amiable point or qualitie that is in it, which 
draweth them to a good liking and contentment with their proper obiects. 
But that cannot be if they discouer any illfauorednesse or disproportion to 
the partes apprehensiue, <pb n="219"/>
as for example, when a sound is either too loude or too low or 
otherwise confuse, the eare is ill affected: so is th'eye if the coulour be sad 
or not liminous and recreatiue, or the shape of a membred body without his 
due measures and simmetry, and the like of euery other sence in his proper 
function. These excesses or defectes or confusions and disorders in the 
sensible obiectes are deformities and vnseemely to the sence. In like sort 
the mynde for the things that be his mentall obiectes hath his good graces 
and his bad, whereof th'one contents him wonderous well, th'other 
displeaseth him continually, no more nor no lesse then ye see the discordes 
of musicke do to a well tuned eare. The Greekes call this good grace of 
euery thing in his kinde, <foreign xml:lang="el">poripon</foreign>, the 
Latines [<hi>decorum</hi>] we in our vulgar call it by a scholasticall terme 
[<hi>decencie</hi>] our owne Saxon English terme is [<hi>seemelynesse</hi>] that 
is to 
say, for his good shape and vtter appearance well pleasing the eye, we call 
it also [<hi>comelynesse</hi>] for the delight it bringeth comming towardes 
vs, 
and to that purpose may be called [<hi>pleasant approche</hi>] so as euery way 
seeking to expresse this <foreign xml:lang="el">prepon</foreign> of the Greekes 
and <hi>decorum</hi> of the Latines, we are faine in our vulgar toung to 
borrow 
the terme which our eye onely for his noble prerogatiue ouer all the rest of 
the sences doth vsurpe, and to apply the same to all good, comely, pleasant 
and honest things, euen to the spirituall obiectes of the mynde, which stand 
no lesse in the due proportion of reason and discourse than any other 
materiall thing doth in his sensible bewtie, proportion and comelynesse. 


</p>
               <p>Now because this comelynesse resteth in the good conformitie of many 
things and their sundry circumstances, with respect one to another, so as 
there be found a iust correspondencie betweene them by this or that relation, 
the Greekes call it <hi>Analogie</hi> or a conuenient proportion. This louely 
conformitie, or proportion, or conueniencie betweene the sence and the 
sensible hath nature her selfe first most carefully obserued in all her owne 
workes, then also by kinde graft it in the appetites of euery creature 
working by intelligence to couet and desire: and in their actions to imitate 
&amp; performe: and of man chiefly before any other creature aswell in his 
speaches as in euery other part of his behauiour. And this in generalitie and 
by an vsuall terme is that which the Latines call <pb n="220"/>
[<hi>decorum</hi>]. So albeit we before alleaged that all our figures be but 
transgressions of our dayly speach, yet if they fall out decently to the good 
liking of the mynde or eare and to the bewtifying of the matter or language, 
all is well, if indecently, and to the eares and myndes misliking (be the 
figure of it selfe neuer so commendable) all is amisse, the election is the 
writers, the iudgement is the worlds, as theirs to whom the reading 
apperteineth. But since the actions of man with their circumstances be 
infinite, and the world likewise replenished with many iudgements, it may 
be a question who shal haue the determination of such controuersie as may 
arise whether this or that action or speach be decent or indecent: and 
verely it seemes to go all by discretion, not perchaunce of euery one, but by 
a learned and experienced discretion, for otherwise seemes the 
<hi>decorum</hi>
to a weake and ignorant iudgement, then it doeth to one of better knowledge 
and experience: which sheweth that it resteth in the discerning part of the 
minde, so as he who can make the best and most differences of things by 
reasonable and wittie distinction is to be the fittest iudge or sentencer of 
[<hi>decencie</hi>]. Such generally is the discreetest man, particularly in any 
art 
the most skilfull and discreetest, and in all other things for the more part 
those that be of much obseruation and greatest experience. The case then 
standing that discretion must chiefly guide all those businesse, since there 
be sundry sortes of discretion all vnlike, euen as there be men of action or 
art, I see no way so fit to enable a man truly to estimate of [<hi>decencie</hi>] 
as 
example, by whose veritie we may deeme the differences of things and their 
proportions, and by particular discussions come at length to sentence of it 
generally, and also in our behauiours the more easily to put it in execution. 
But by reason of the sundry circumstances, that mans affaires are as it 
were wrapt in, this [<hi>decencie</hi>] , in respect of the person who speakes: 
another of his to whom it is spoken: another of whom we speake: another of 
what we speake, and in what place and time and to what purpose. And as it 
is of speach, so of al other our behauiours. We wil therefore set you down 
some few examples of euery circumstance how it alters the decencie of 
speach or action. And <pb n="221"/>
by these few shal ye be able to gather a number more to confirme and 
establish your iudgement by a perfit discretion. 


</p>
               <p>This decencie, so far foorth as apperteineth to the consideration of our art, 
resteth in writing, speech and behauiour. But because writing is no more 
then the image or character of speech, they shall goe together in these our 
obseruations. And first wee wil sort you out diuers points, in which the 
wife and learned men of times past haue noted much decency or vndecencie, 
euery man according to his discretion, as it hath bene said afore: but 
wherein for the most part all discreete men doe generally agree, and varie 
not in opinion, whereof the examples I will geue you be worthie of 
remembrance: &amp; though they brought with them no doctrine or 
institution at 
all, yet for the solace they may geue the readers, after such a rable of 
scholastical precepts which be tedious, these reports being of the nature of 
matters historicall, they are to be embraced: but olde memories are very 
profitable to the mind, and serue as a glasse to looke vpon and behold the 
euents of time, and more exactly to skan the trueth of euery case that shall 
happen in the affaires of man, and many there be that haply doe not obserue 
euery particularitie in matter of decencie or vndecencie: and yet when the 
case is tolde them by another man, they commonly geue the same sentence 
vpon it. But yet whosoeuer obserueth much, shalbe counted the wisest and 
discreetest man, and whosoeuer spends all his life in his owne vaine actions 
and conceits, and obserues no mans elfe, he shal in the ende prooue but a 
simple man. In which respect it is alwaies said, one man of experience is 
wiser than tenne learned men, because of his long and studious obseruation 
and often triall. 


</p>
               <p>And your decencies are of sundrie sorts, according to the many 
circumstances accompanying our writing speech or behauiour, so as in the 
very sound or voice or him that speaketh, there is a decencie that 
becommeth, and an vndecencie that misbecommeth vs, which th'Emperor 
<hi>Anthonine</hi> marked well in the Orator <hi>Philiseus</hi>, who spake 
before him 
with so small and shrill a voice as the Emperor was greatly annoyed 
therewith, and to make him shorten his tale, said, by thy beard thou shouldst 
be a man, but by thy voice a woman. 
<pb n="222"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phauorinus</hi> the Philosopher was counted very wise and well learned, 
but 
a little too talkatiue and full of words: for the which <hi>Timocrates</hi>
reprooued him in the hearing of one <hi>Polemon</hi>. That is no wonder quoth 
<hi>Polemon</hi>, for so be all women. And besides, <hi>Phauorinus</hi> being 
knowen 
for an Eunuke or gelded man, came by the same nippe to be noted as an 
effeminate and degenerate person. 


</p>
               <p>And there is a measure to be vsed in a mans speech or tale, so as it be 
neither for shortnesse too darke, nor for length too tedious. Which 
made<hi>Cleomenes</hi> king of the Lacedemonians geue this vnpleasant 
answere 
to the Ambassadors of the Samiens, who had tolde him a long message from 
their Citie, and desired to know his pleasure in it. My maisters (saith he) 
the first part of your tale was so long, that I remember it not, which made 
that the second I vnderstoode not, and as for the third part I doe nothing 
well allow of. Great princes and graue counsellers who haue little spare 
leisure to hearken, would haue speeches vsed to them such as be short and 
sweete. 


</p>
               <p>And if they be spoken by a man of account, or one who for his yeares, 
profession or dignitie should be thought wise &amp; reuerend, his speeches 
&amp; words should also be graue, pithie &amp; sententious, which was 
well noted by king <hi>Antiochus</hi>, who likened <hi>Hermogenes</hi> the 
famous Orator of Greece, vnto these fowles in their moulting time, when 
their feathers be sick, and be so loase in the flesh that at any little rowse 
they can easilie shake them off; so saith he, can <hi>Hermogenes</hi> of all 
the men that euer I knew, as easilie deliuer from him his vaine and 
impertinent speeches and words. 


</p>
               <p>And there is a decencie, that euery speech should be to the appetite and 
delight, or dignitie of the hearer &amp; not for any respect arrogant or 
vndutifull, as was that of <hi>Alexander</hi> sent Embassadour from the 
<hi>Athenians</hi> to th'Emperour <hi>Marcus</hi>, this man seing th'emperour 
not so 
attentiue to his tale, as he would haue had him, said by way of interruption, 
<hi>Caesar</hi> I pray thee giue me better eare, it seemest thou knowest me 
not, 
nor from whom I came: the Emperour nothing well liking his bold malapert 
speech, said: thou art deceyued, for I heare thee and know well inough, that 
thou art that fine, foolish, curious, sawcie <hi>Alexander</hi> that tendest to 
nothing <pb n="223"/>
but to combe &amp; cury thy haire, to pare thy nailes, to pick thy teeth, and 
to 
perfume thy selfe with sweet oyles, that no man may abide the sent of thee. 
Prowde speeches, and too much finesse and curiousitie is not commendable 
in an Embassadour. And I haue knowen in my time such of them, as studied 
more vpon what apparell they should weare, and what countenaunces they 
should keepe at the times of their audience, then they did vpon th'effect of 
their errant or commission. 


</p>
               <p>And there is decency in that euery man should talke of the things they haue 
best skill of, and not in that, their knowledge and learning serueth them not 
to do, as we are wont to say, he speaketh of Robin hood that neuer shot in 
his bow: there came a great Oratour before <hi>Cleomenes</hi> king of 
<hi>Lacedemonia</hi>, and vttered much matter to him touching fortitude and 
valiancie in the warres: the king laughed: why laughest thou quoth the 
learned man, since thou art a king thy selfe, and one whom fortitude best 
becommeth? why said <hi>Cleomenes</hi> would it not make any body laugh, 
to 
heare the swallow who feeds onely vpon flies, to boast of his great pray, 
and see the eagle stand by and say nothing? if thou wert a man of warre or 
euer hadst bene day of thy life, I would not laugh to here thee speake of 
valiancie, but neuer being so, &amp; speaking before an old captaine I can 
not 
choose but laugh. 


</p>
               <p>And some things and speaches are decent or indecent in respect of the time 
they be spoken or done in. As when a great clerk presented king 
<hi>Antiochus</hi> with a booke treating all of iustice, the king that time 
lying at 
the siege of a towne, who lookt vpon the title of the booke, and cast it to 
him againe: saying, what a diuell tellest thou to me of iustice, now thou 
seest me vse force and do the best I can to bereeue mine enimie of his 
towne? euery thing hath his season which is called Opportunitie, and the 
vnfitnesse or vndecency of the time is called Importunitie. 


</p>
               <p>Sometime the vndecency ariseth by the indignitie of the word in respect of 
the speaker himselfe, as whan a daughter of Fraunce and next heyre generall 
to the crowne (if the law <hi>Salique</hi> had not barred her) being set in a 
great 
chaufe by some harde words giuen her by another prince of the bloud, said 
her anger, thou durst not haue said thus much to me if God had giuen me a 
paire of, &amp;c. <pb n="224"/>
and told all out, meaning if God had made her a man and not a woman she had 
bene king of Fraunce. The word became not the greatnesse of her person, and 
much lesse her sex, whose chiefe vertue is shamefastnesse, which the 
Latines call <hi>Verecundia</hi>, that is a naturall feare to be noted with any 
impudicitie: so as when they heare or see any thing tending that way they 
commonly blush, &amp; is a part greatly praised in all women. 


</p>
               <p>Yet will ye see in many cases how pleasant speeches and fauouring some 
skurrillity and vnshamefastnes haue now and then a certaine decencie, and 
well become both the speaker to say, and the hearer to abide, but that is by 
reason of some other circumstance, as when the speaker himselfe is knowne 
to be a common iester or buffon, such as take vpon them to make princes 
merry, or when some occasion is giuen by the hearer to induce such a 
pleasaunt speach, and in many other cases whereof no generall rule can be 
giuen, but are best knowen by example: as when Sir <hi>Andrew Flamock</hi>
king 
<hi>Henry</hi> the eights standerdbearer, a merry conceyted man and apt to 
skoffe, waiting one day at the kings heeles when he entred the parke at 
Greenewich, the king blew his horne, <hi>Flamock</hi> hauing his belly full, 
and 
his tayle at commaundement, gaue out a rappe nothing faintly, that the king 
turned him about a said how now sirra? <hi>Flamock</hi> not well knowing 
how 
to excuse his vnmannerly act, if it please you Sir quoth he, your Maiesty 
blew one blast for the keeper and I another for his man. The king laughed 
hartily and tooke it nothing offensiuely: for indeed as the case fell out it 
was not vndecently spoken by Sir <hi>Andrew Flamock</hi>, for it was the 
cleaneliest excuse he could make, and a merry implicatiue in termes nothing 
odious, and therefore a sporting satisfaction to the kings mind, in a matter 
which without some such merry answere could not haue bene well taken. So 
was <hi>Flamocks</hi> action most vncomely, but his speech excellently well 
becomming the occasion. 


</p>
               <p>But at another time and in another like case, the same skurrillitie of 
<hi>Flamock</hi> was more offensiue, because it was more indecent. As when 
the 
king hauing <hi>Flamock</hi> with him in his barge, passing from Westminster 
to 
Greenewich to visite a fayre Lady whom the king loued and was lodged in the 
tower of the Parke: the <pb n="225"/>
king comming within sight of the tower, and being disposed to be merry, 
said, <hi>Flamock</hi> let vs rime: as well as I can said <hi>Flamock</hi> if it 
please 
your grace. The king began thus: 

</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>Within this towre,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>There lieth a flower,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That hath my hart</hi>. 

</l>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flamock</hi> for aunswer: <hi>Within this hower, she will, &amp; c</hi>. 
with the rest 
in so vncleanly termes, as might not now become me by the rule of 
<hi>Decorum</hi> to vtter writing to so great a Maiestie, but the king tooke 
them 
in so euill part, as he bit <hi>Flamock</hi> auant varlet, and that he should no 
more be so neere vnto him. And wherein I would faine learne, lay this 
vndecencie? in the skurrill and filthy termes not meete for a kings eare? 
perchance so. For the king was a wise and graue man, and though he hated 
not a faire woman, yet liked he nothing well to heare speeches of ribaudrie: 
as they report of th'emperour <hi>Octauian: Licet fuerit ipse 
incontinentissimus, fuit tamen incontinentie, seuerissimus vltor</hi>. But 
the 
very cause in deed was for that <hi>Flamocks</hi> reply answered not the 
kings 
expectation, for the kings rime commencing with a pleasant and amorous 
proposition: Sir <hi>Andrew Flamock</hi> to finish ti not with loue but with 
lothsomnesse, by termes very rude and vnciuill, and seing the king greatly 
fauour that Ladie for her much beauty by like or some other good partes, by 
his fastidious aunswer to make her seeme odious to him, it helde a great 
disproportion to the kings appetite, for nothing is so vnpleasant to a man, as 
to be encountred in his chiefe affection, &amp; specially in his loues, &amp; 
whom we 
honour we should also reuerence their appetite, or at the least beare with 
them (not being wicked and vtterly euill) and whatsoeuer they do affect, we 
do not as becommeth vs if we make it seeme to them horrible. This in mine 
opinion was the chiefe cause of the vndecencie and also of the kings offence. 
<hi>Aristotle</hi> the great philosopher knowing this very well, what time he 
put 
<hi>Calistenes</hi> to king <hi>Alexander</hi> the greats seruice gaue him this 
lesson. 
Sirra quoth he, ye go now from a scholer to be a courtier, see ye speake to 
the king your maister, either nothing at all, or els that which pleaseth him, 
which rule if <hi>Calistenes</hi> had followed and forborne to crosse the 
kings 
appetite in diuerse speeches, it had not cost him so <pb n="226"/>
deepely as afterward it did. A like matter of offence fell out betweene 
th'Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, &amp; an Embassadour of king 
<hi>Henry</hi> the 
eight, whom I could name but will not for the great opinion the world had of 
his wisdome and sufficiency in that behalfe, and all for misusing of a terme. 
The king in the matter of controuersie betwixt him and Ladie 
<hi>Catherine</hi>
of <hi>Castill</hi> the Emperours awnt, found himselfe grieued that the 
Emperour 
should take her part and worke vnder hand with the Pope to hinder the 
diuorce: and gaue him Embassadour commission in good termes to open his 
griefes to the Emperour, and to expostulat with his Maiestie, for that he 
seemed to forget the kings great kindnesse and friendship before times vsed 
with th'Emperour, aswell by disbursing for him sundry great summers of 
monie which were not all yet repayd: as also by furnishing him at his neede 
with store of man and munition to his warres, and now to be thus vsed he 
thought it a very euill requitall. The Embassadour for too much animositie 
and more then needed in the case, or perchance by ignorance of the 
proprietie of the Spanish tongue, told the Emperour among other words, that 
he was <hi>Hombre el mas ingrato enel mondo</hi>, the ingratest person in the 
world to vse his maister so. The Emperour tooke him suddainly with the 
word, and said: callest thou me <hi>ingrato?</hi> I tell thee learne better 
termes, or else I will teach them thee. Th'Embassacour excused it by his 
commission, and said: they were the king his maisters words, and not his 
owne. Nay quoth th'Emperour, thy maister, durst not haue sent me these 
words, were it not for that broad ditch betweene him &amp; me, meaning the 
sea, 
which is hard to passe with an army of reuenge. The Embassadour was 
commanded away &amp; no more hard by the Emperor, til by some other 
means 
afterward the grief was either pacified or forgotten &amp; all this 
inconuenience grew by misuse of one word, which being otherwise spoken 
&amp; 
in some sort qualified, had easily holpen all, &amp; yet th'Embassadour 
might 
sufficiently haue satisfied his commission &amp; much better aduanced his 
purpose, as to haue said for this word [<hi>ye are ingrate</hi>] ye haue not 
vsed 
such gratitude towards him as he hath deserued: so ye may see how a word 
spoken vndecently, not knowing the phrase or proprietie of a language, 
maketh a whole matter many times miscarrie. In which respect it <pb n="227"/>
is to be wished, that none Ambassadour speake his principall 
commandements but in his own language, or in another as naturall to him as 
his owne, and so it is vsed in all places of the world sauing in England. The 
Princes and their commissioners fearing least otherwise they might vtter 
any thing to their disaduantage, or els to their disgrace: and I my selfe 
hauing seene the Courts of Fraunce, Spaine, Italie, and that of the Empire, 
with many inferior Courts, could neuer perceiue that the most noble 
personages, though they knew very well how to speake many forraine 
languages, would at any times that they had bene spoken vnto, answere but 
in their owne, the Frenchman in French the Spaniard in Spanish, the Italian 
in Italian, and the very Dutch Prince in the Dutch language: whether it were 
more for pride, or for feare of any lapse, I cannot tell. And <hi>Henrie</hi>
Earle 
of Arundel being an old Courtier and a very princely man in all his actions, 
kept that rule alwaies. For on a time passing from England towards Italie by 
her maiesties licence, he was very honorably enterteined at the Court of 
Brussels, by the Lady Duches of Parma, Regent there: and sitting at a 
banquet with her, where also was the Prince of Orange, with all the greatest 
Prince of the state, the Earle, though he could resonably well speake 
French, would not speake one French word, but all English, whether he asked 
any question, or answered it, but all was done by Truchemen. In so much as 
the Prince of Orange maruelling at it, looked a side on that part where I 
stoode a beholder of the feast, and sayd, I maruell your Noblemen of England 
doe not desire to be better languaged in the forraine languages. This word 
was by and by reported to the Earle. Quoth the Earle againe, tell my Lord the 
Prince, that I loue to speake in that language, in which I can best vtter my 
mind and not mistake. 


</p>
               <p>Another Ambassadour vsed the like ouersight by ouerweening himselfe that 
he could naturally speake the French tongue, whereas in troth he was not 
skilfull in their termes. This Ambassadour being a Bohemian, sent from the 
Emperour to the French Court, where after his first audience, he was highly 
feasted and banquetted. On a time, among other, a great Princesse sitting at 
the table, by way of talke asked the Ambassador whether the Empresse his <pb n="228"/>
mistresse when she went a hunting, or otherwise trauailed abroad for her 
solace, did ride a horsback or goe in her coach. To which the Ambassadour 
answered vnwares and not knowing the French terme, <hi>Par foy elle 
cheuauche fort bien, &amp; si en prend grand plaisir</hi>. She rides (saith he) 
very 
well, and takes great pleasure in it. There was good smiling one vpon 
another of the Ladies and Lords, the Ambassador wist not whereat, but 
laughed himselfe for companie. This word <hi>Chauaucher</hi> in the French 
tongue hath a reprobate sence, specially being spoken of a womans riding. 


</p>
               <p>And as rude and vnciuill speaches carry a marueilous great indecencie, so 
doe sometimes those that be ouermuch affected and nice: or that doe fauour 
of ignorance or adulation, and be in the eare of graue and wise persons no 
lesse offensiue than the other: as when a sutor in Rome came to 
<hi>Tiberius</hi>
the emperor and said, I would open my case to your Maiestie, if it were not 
to trouble your sacred businesse, <hi>sacras vestras occupationes</hi> as the 
Historiographer reporteth. What meanest thou by that terme quoth the 
Emperor, say <hi>laboriosas</hi> I pray thee, &amp; so thou maist truely say, 
and bid 
him leaue off such affected flattering termes. 


</p>
               <p>The like vndecencie vsed a Herald at armes sent by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth 
Emperor, to <hi>Fraunces</hi> the first French king, bringing him a message of 
defiance, and thinking to qualifie the bitternesse of his message with words 
pompous and magnificent for the kings honor, vsed much this terme (sacred 
Maiestie) which was not vsually geuen to the French king, but to say for the 
most part [<hi>Sire</hi>]. The French king neither liking of his errant, nor yet 
of 
his pompous speech, said somewhat sharply, I pray thee good fellow clawe 
me not where I itch not with thy sacred maiestie but goe to thy businesse, 
and tell thine errand in such termes as are decent betwixt enemies, for thy 
master is not my frend, and turned him to a Prince of the bloud who stoode 
by, saying, me thinks this fellow speakes like Bishop <hi>Nicholas</hi>, for on 
Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> night commonly the Scholars of the Countrey make 
them a 
Bishop, who like a foolish boy, goeth about blessing and preaching with so 
childish termes, as maketh the people laugh at his foolish counterfaite 
speeches. 


</p>
               <p>And yet in speaking or writing of a Princes affaires &amp; fortunes there is 
a 
certaine <hi>Decorum</hi>, that we may not vse the same termes <pb n="229"/>
in their busines, as we might very wel doe in a meaner persons, the case 
being all one, such reuerence is due to their estates. As for example, if an 
Historiographer shal write of an Emperor or King, how such a day hee ioyned 
battel with his enemie, and being ouer-laide ranne out of the fielde, and 
tooke his heeles, or put spurre to his horse and fled as fast as hee could : 
the termes be not decent, but of a meane souldier or captaine, it were not 
vndecently spoken. And as one, who translating certaine bookes of 
<hi>Virgils 
Aeneidos</hi> into English meetre, said that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was fayne to 
trudge out 
of Troy: which terme became better to be spoken of a beggar, or of a rogue, 
or a lackey: of so wee vse to say to such maner of people, be trudging hence. 


</p>
               <p>Another Englishing this word of <hi>Virgill</hi> [<hi>fato profugus</hi>] called 
<hi>Aeneas</hi> [<hi>by fare a fugitiue</hi>] which was vndecently spoken, and 
not to 
the Authours intent in the same word: for whom he studied by all means to 
auaunce aboue all other men of the world for vertue and magnanimitie, he 
meant not to make him a fugitiue. But by occasion of his great distresses, 
and of the hardnesse of his destinies, he would haue it appeare that 
<hi>Aeneas</hi> was enforced to flie out of <hi>Troy</hi>, and for many yeeres to be a 
romer and a wandrer about the world both by land and sea [<hi>fato profugus</hi>] 
and neuer to find any resting place till he came into <hi>Italy</hi>, so as ye may 
euidently perceiue in this <hi>terme</hi> [<hi>fugitiue</hi>] a notable indignity 
offred to 
that princely person, and by th'other word (a wanderer) none indignitie at 
all, but rather a terme of much loue and commiseration. The same 
translatour when he came to these wordes: <hi>Insignem pietate virum, tot 
voluere casus tot adire labores compulit</hi>. Hee turned it thus, what 
moued 
<hi>Iuno</hi> to tugge so great a captaine as <hi>Aeneas</hi>, which word tugge 
spoken 
in this case is so vndecent as none other could haue bene deuised, and tooke 
his first originall from the cart, because it signifieth the pull or draught of 
the oxen or horses, and therefore the leathers that beare the chiefe stresse 
of the draught, the cartars call them tugges, and so wee vse to say that 
shrewd boyes tugge each other by the eares, for pull. 


</p>
               <p>Another of our vulgar makers, spake as illfaringly in this verse written to 
the dispraise of a rich man and couetous. Thou hast a <pb n="230"/>
misers minde (thou has a princes pelfe) a lewde terme to be spoken of a 
princes treasure, which in no respect nor for any cause is to be called pelfe, 
though it were neuer so meane for pelfe is properly the scrappes or shreds 
of taylors and of skinners, which are accompted of so vile price as they be 
commonly cast out of dores, or otherwise bestowed vpon base purposes: and 
carrieth not the like reason or decencie, as when we say in reproch of a 
niggard or vserer, or worldly couetous man, that he setteth more by a little 
pelfe of the world, than by his credit or health, or conscience. For in 
comparison of these treasours, all the gold or siluer in the world may by a 
skornefull terme be called pelfe, &amp; so ye see that the reason of the 
decencie 
holdeth not alike in both cases. Now let vs passe from these examples, to 
treat of those that concerne the comelinesse and decencie of mans 
behauiour. 


</p>
               <p>And some speech may be whan it is spoken very vndecent and yet the same 
hauing afterward somewhat added to it may become prety and decent, as 
was the stowte worde vsed by a captaine in Fraunce, who sitting at the 
lower end of the Duke of <hi>Guyses</hi> table among many, the day after 
there 
had bene a great battaile foughten, the Duke finding that this captaine was 
not seene that day to do any thing in the field, taxed him priuily thus in al 
the hearings. Where were you Sir the day of the battaile, for I saw ye not? 
the captaine answered promptly: where ye durst not haue bene: and the 
Duke began to kindle with the worde, which the Gentleman perceiuing, said 
spedily: I was that day among the carriages, where your excellencie would 
not for a thousand crownes haue bene seene. Thus from vndecent it came by 
a wittie reformation to be made decent againe. 


</p>
               <p>The like hapned on a time at the Duke of Northumberlandes bourd, where 
merry <hi>ohn Heywood</hi> was allowed to sit at the tables end. The Duke 
had a 
very noble and honorable mynde alwayes to pay his debts well, and when he 
lacked money, would not stick to sell the greatest part of his plate: so had 
he done few dayes before. <hi>Heywood</hi> being loth to call for his drinke 
so 
oft as he was dry, turned his eye toward the cupbord and sayd I finde great 
misse of your graces standing cups: the Duke thinking he had spoken it of 
some knowledge that his plate was lately sold, said somewhat <pb n="231"/>
sharpely, why Sir will not those cuppes serue as good a man as your selfe. 
<hi>Heywood</hi> readily replied. Yes if it please your grace, but I would haue 
one of them stand still at myne elbow full of drinke that I might not be 
driuen to trouble your men so often to call for it. This pleasant and speedy 
reuers of the former wordes holpe all the matter againe, whereupon the 
Duke became very pleasaunt and dranke a bolle of wine to <hi>Heywood</hi>, 
and 
bid a cup should alwayes be standing by him. 


</p>
               <p>It were to busie a peece of worke for me to tell you of all the partes of 
decencie and indecency which haue bene obserued in the speaches of man 
&amp; 
in his writings, and this that I tell you is rather to solace your eares with 
pretie conceits after a sort of long scholasticall preceptes which may 
happen haue doubled them, rather then for any other purpose of institution 
or doctrine, which to any Courtier of experience, is not necessarie in this 
behalfe. And as they appeare by the former examples to rest in our speach 
and writing: so do the same by like proportion consist in the whole 
behauiour of man, and that which he doth well and commendably is euer 
decent, and the contrary vndecent, not in euery mans iudgement alwayes one, 
but after their seuerall discretion and by circumstance diuersly, as by the 
next Chapter shalbe shewed. 

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="c3.24" type="chapter">
               <head>Of decencie in behauiour which also belongs to the consideration of the Poet or maker.</head>
               <p>And there is a decency to be obserued in euery mans action &amp; behauiour 
aswell as in his speach &amp; writing which some peraduenture would thinke 
impertinent to be treated of in this booke, where we do but informer the 
commendable fashions of language &amp; stile: but that is otherwise, for 
the 
good maker or poet who is in decent speach &amp; good termes to describe 
all 
things and with prayse or dispraise to report euery mans behauiour, ought to 
know the comelinesse of an action aswell as of a word &amp; thereby to 
direct 
himselfe both in praise &amp; perswasion or any other point that perteines 
to 
the Oratours arte. Wherefore some examples we will set downe of this 
maner of decency in behauiour leauing you for the rest to our booke which we 
haue written <hi>de Decoro</hi>, where ye shall see both partes <pb n="232"/>
handled more exactly. And this decencie of mans behauiour aswell as of his 
speach must also be deemed by discretion, in which regard the thing that 
may well become one man to do may not become another, and that which is 
seemely to be done in this place is not so seemely in that, and at such a 
time decent, but at another time vndecent, and in such a case and for such a 
purpose, and to this and that end and by this and that euent, perusing all the 
circumstances with like consideration. Therefore we say that it might 
become king <hi>Alexander</hi> to giue a hundreth talentes to 
<hi>Anaxagoras</hi> the 
Philosopher, but not for a beggerly Philosopher to accept so great a gift, for 
such a Prince could not be so impouerished by that expence, but the 
Philosopher was by it excessiuely to be enriched, so was the kings action 
proportionable to his estate and therefore decent, the Philosophers, 
disproportionable both to his profession and calling and therefore indecent. 


</p>
               <p>And yet if we shall examine the same point with a clearer discretion, it may 
be said that whatsoeuer it might become king <hi>Alexander</hi> of his regal 
largesse to bestow vpon a poore Philosopher vnasked, that might aswell 
become the Philosopher to receiue at his hands without refusal, and had 
otherwise bene some empeachement of the kings abilitie or wisedome, 
which had not bene decent in the Philosopher, nor the immoderatnesse of the 
kinges gift in respect of the Philosophers meane estate made his acceptance 
the lesse decent, since Princes liberalities are not measured by merite nor 
by other mens estimations, but by their owne appetits and according to their 
greatnesse. So said king <hi>Alexander</hi> very like himselfe to one 
<hi>Perillus</hi>
to whom he had geuen a very great gift, which he made curtesy to accept, 
saying it was too much for such a mean person, what quoth the king if it be 
too much for thy selfe, hast thou neuer a friend or kinsman that may fare 
the better by it? But peraduenture if any such immoderat gift had bene 
craued by the Philosopher and not voluntarily offred by the king it had bene 
vndecent to haue taken it. Euen so if one that standeth vpon his merite, and 
spares to craue the Princes liberalitie in that which is moderate and fit for 
him, doth as vndecently. For men should not expect till the Prince 
remembred it of himselfe and began as it were the gratification, but ought 
to be <pb n="233"/>
put in remembraunce by humble solicitations, and that is duetifull &amp; 
decent, 
which made king <hi>Henry</hi> th'eight her Maiesties most noble father, and 
for 
liberality nothing inferiour to king <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, aunswere one 
of 
his priuie chamber, who prayd him to be good &amp; gracious to a certaine 
old 
Knight being his seruant, for that he was but an ill begger, if he be ashamed 
to begge we wil thinke scorne to giue. And yet peraduenture in both these 
cases, the vndecencie for too much crauing or sparing to craue, might be 
easily holpen by a decent magnificence in the Prince, as <hi>Amazes</hi> king 
of 
Aegypt very honorably considered, who asking one day for one 
<hi>Diopithus</hi> a 
noble man of his Court, what was become of him for that he had not sene 
him wait of long time, one about the king told him that he heard say he was 
sicke and of some conceit he had taken that his Maiestie had but slenderly 
looked to him, vsing many others very bountifully. I beshrew his fooles head 
quoth the king, why had he not sued vnto vs and made vs priuie of his want, 
then added, but in truth we are most to blame our selues, who by a mindeful 
beneficence without sute should haue supplied his bashfulnesse, and 
forthwith commaunded a great reward in money &amp; pension to be sent 
vnto 
him, but it hapned that when the kings messengers entred the chamber of 
<hi>Diopithus</hi>, eh had newly giuen vp the ghost: the messengers sorrowed 
the 
case, and <hi>Diopithus</hi> friends sate by and wept, not so much for 
<hi>Diopithus</hi> death, as for pitie that he ouerliued not the comming of the 
kings reward. Therupon it came euer after to be vsed for a prouerbe that 
when any good turne commeth too late to be vsed, to cal it <hi>Diopithus</hi>
reward. 


</p>
               <p>In Italy and Fraunce I haue knowen it vsed for common pollicie, the Princes 
to differre the bestowing of their great liberalities as Cardinalships and 
other high dignities &amp; offices of gayne, till the parties whom they 
should 
seeme to gratifie be so old or so sicke as it is not likely they should long 
enioy them. 


</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth French king, I being at the Spaw 
waters, 
there lay a Marshall of Fraunce called <hi>Monsieur de Sipier</hi>, to vse those 
waters for his health, but when the Phisitions had all giuen him vp, and that 
there was no hope of life in him, came from the king to him a letters 
patents of six thousand crownes <pb n="234"/>
yearely pension during his life with many comfortable wordes: the man was 
not su much past remembraunce, but he could say to the messenger <hi>trop 
tard, trop tard</hi>, it should haue come before, for in deede it had bene 
promised long and came not till now that he could not fare the better by it. 


</p>
               <p>And it became king <hi>Antiochus</hi>, better to bestow the faire Lady 
<hi>Stratonica</hi> his wife vpon his sonne <hi>Demetrius</hi> who lay sicke for 
her 
loue and would else haue perished, as the Physitions cunningly discouered by 
the beating of his pulse, then it could become <hi>Demetrius</hi> to be 
inamored 
with his fathers wife, or to enioy her of his guift, because the fathers act 
was led by discretion and of a fatherly compassion, not grutching to depart 
form his deerest possession to saue his childes life, where as the sonne in 
his appetite had no reason to lead him to loue vnlawfully, for whom it had 
rather bene decent to die then to haue violated his fathers bed with safetie 
of his life. 


</p>
               <p>No more would it be seemely for an aged man to play the wanton like a child, 
for it stands not with the conueniency of nature, yet when king 
<hi>Agesilaus</hi>
hauing a great sort of little children, was one day disposed to solace 
himself among them in a gallery where they plaied, and tooke a little hobby 
horse of wood and bestrid it to keepe them in play, one of his friends 
seemed to mislike his lightnes, ô good friend quoth <hi>Agesilaus</hi>, 
rebuke me not for this fault till thou haue children of thine owne, shewing in 
deede that it came not of vanitie but of a fatherly affection, ioying in the 
sport and company of his little children, in which respect and as that place 
and time serued, it was dispenceable in him &amp; not indecent. 


</p>
               <p>And in the choise of a mans delights &amp; maner of his life, there is a 
decencie, 
and so we say th'old man generally is no fit companion for the young man, 
nor the rich for the poore, nor the wise for the foolish. Yet in some respects 
and by discretion it may be otherwise, as when the old man hath the 
gouernment of the young, the wise teaches the foolish, the rich is wayted on 
by the poore for their reliefe, in which regard the conuersation is not 
indecent. 


</p>
               <p>And <hi>Proclus</hi> the Philosopher knowing how euery indecencie is 
vnpleasant 
to nature, and namely, how vncomely a thing it is for young men to doe as 
old men doe (at leastwise as young men <pb n="235"/>
for the most part doe take it) applyed it very wittily to his purpose: for 
hauing his sonne and heire a notable vnthrift, &amp; delighting in nothing but 
in 
haukes and hounds, and gay apparrell, and such like vanities, which neither 
by gentle nor sharpe admonitions of his father, could make him leaue. 
<hi>Proclus</hi> himselfe not onely bare with his sonne, but also vsed it 
himselfe 
for company, which some of his frends greatly rebuked him for, saying, 
<hi>ô Proclus</hi>, an olde man and a Philosopher to play the foole and 
lasciuious more than the sonne. Mary, quoth <hi>Proclus</hi>, &amp; therefore 
I do it, 
for it is the next way to make my sonne change his life, when he shall see 
how vndecent it is in me to leade such a life, when he shall see how 
vndecent it is in me to leade such a life, and for him being a yong man, to 
keepe companie with me being an old man, and to doe that which I doe. 


</p>
               <p>So is it not vnseemely for any ordinarie Captaine to winne the victory or any 
other auantage in warre by fraud &amp; breach of faith: as <hi>Hanniball</hi>
with the 
Romans, but it could not well become the Romaines managing so great an 
Empire, by examples of honour and iustice to doe as <hi>Hanniball</hi> did. 
And 
when <hi>Parmenio</hi> in a like case perswaded king <hi>Alexander</hi> to 
breake the 
day of his appointment, and to set vpon <hi>Darius</hi> at the sodaine, which 
<hi>Alexander</hi> refused to doe, <hi>Parmenio</hi> saying, I would doe it if I 
were 
<hi>Alexander</hi>, and I too quoth <hi>Alexander</hi> if I were <hi>Parmenio</hi>: 
but it 
behooueth me in honour to fight liberally with mine enemies, and iustly to 
ouercome. And thus ye see that was decent in <hi>Parmenios</hi> action, 
which 
was not in the king his masters. 


</p>
               <p>A great nobleman and Counseller in this Realme was secretlie aduised by his 
friend, not to vse so much writing his letters in fauour of euery man that 
asked them, specially to the Iudges of the Realme in cases of iustice. To 
whom the noble man answered, it becomes vs Councellors better to vse 
instance for our friend, then for the Iudges to sentence at instance: for 
whatsoeuer we doe require them, it is in their choise to refuse to doe, but 
for all that the example was ill and dangerous. 


</p>
               <p>And there is a decencie in chusing the times of a mans busines, and as the 
Spaniard sayes, <hi>es tiempo de negotiar</hi>, there is a fitte time for euery 
man to performe his businesse in, &amp; to attend his affaires, which out of 
that 
time would be vndecent: as to sleepe al day and <pb n="236"/>
wake al night, and to goe a hunting by torch-light as an old Earle of Arundel 
vsed to doe, or for any occasion of little importance, to wake a man out of 
his sleepe, or to make him rise from his dinner to talke with him, or such 
like importunities, for so we call euery vnseasonable action, and the 
vndecencie of the time. 


</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Callicratides</hi> being sent Ambassador by the Lacedemonians, to 
<hi>Cirus</hi>
the young king of Persia to contract with him for money and men toward 
their warres against the Athenians, came to the Court at such vnseasonable 
time as the king was yet in the midst of his dinner, and went away againe 
saying, it is now no time to interrupt the kings mirth. he came againe 
another day in the after noone, and finding the king at a rere-banquet, and to 
haue taken the wine somewhat plentifully, turned back againe, saying, I 
thinke there is no houre fitte to deal with <hi>Cirus</hi>, for he is euer in his 
banquets: I will rather leaue all the busines vndone, then doe any thing that 
shall not become the Lacedemonians: meaning to offer conference of so 
great importaunce to his Countrey, with a man so distempered by surfet, as 
hee was not likely to geue him any reasonable resolution in the cause. 


</p>
               <p>One <hi>Eudamidas</hi> brother to king <hi>Agis</hi> of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi>, 
comming by 
<hi>Zenocrates</hi> schoole and looking it, saw him sit in his chaire, disputing 
with a long hoare beard, asked who it was, one answered, Sir it is a wise 
man and one of them that searches after vertue, and if he haue not yet found 
it quoth <hi>Eudamidas</hi> when will he vse it, that now at this yeares is 
seeking after it, as who would way it is not time to talke of matter when 
they should be put in execution, nor for an old man to be to seeke what 
vertue is, which all his youth he should haue had in exercise. 


</p>
               <p>Another time comming to heare a notable Philosopher dispute, it happened, 
that all was ended euen as he came, and one of his familiers would haue had 
him requested the Philosopher to beginne againe, that were indecent and 
nothing ciuill quoth <hi>Eudamidas</hi>, for if he should come to me 
supperlesse 
when I had supped before, were it seemely for him to pray me to suppe 
againe for his companie? 


</p>
               <p>And the place makes a thing decent or indecent, in which consideration one 
<hi>Euboidas</hi> being sent Embassadour into a forraine <pb n="237"/>
realme, some of his familiars tooke occasion at the table to praise the 
wiues and women of that country in presence of their owne husbands, which 
th'embassadour misliked, and when supper was ended and the guestes 
departed, tooke his familiars aside, and told them that it was nothing 
decent in a strange country to praise the women, nor specially a wife before 
her husbands face, for inconueniencie that might rise thereby, aswell to the 
prayser as to the woman, and that the chiefe commendation of a chast 
matrone, was to be knowen onely to her husband, and not to be obserued by 
straungers and guestes. 


</p>
               <p>And in the vse of apparell there is no litle decency and vndecencie to be 
perceiued, as well for the fashion as the stuffe, for it is comely that euer 
estate and vocation should be knowen by the differences of their habit: a 
clarke from a lay man: a gentleman from a yeoman: a souldier from a 
citizen, and the chiefe of euery degree from their inferiours, because in 
confusion and disorder there is no manner of decencie. 


</p>
               <p>The Romaines of any other people most seuere censurers of decencie, though 
no vpper garment so comely for a ciuill man as a long playted gowne, because 
it sheweth much grauitie &amp; also pudicitie, hiding euery member of the 
body 
which had not bin pleasant to behold. In somuch as a certain 
<hi>Proconsull</hi>
or Legat of theirs dealing one day with <hi>Ptolome</hi> king of Egipt, seeing 
him 
clad in a straite narrow garment very lasciuiously, discouering euery part of 
his body, gaue him a great checke for it: and said, that vnlesse he vsed more 
sad and comely garments, the Romaines would take no pleasure to hold 
amitie with him, for by the wantonnes of his garment they would iudge the 
vanitie of his mind, not to be worthy of their constant friendship. A 
pleasant old courtier wearing one day in the sight of a great councellour, 
after the new guise, a french cloake skarce reaching to the wast, a long 
beaked doublet hanging downe to his thies, &amp; an high paire of silke 
netherstocks that couered all his buttockes and loignes the Councellor 
marueled to see him in that sort disguised, and otherwise than he had bien 
woont to be. Sir quoth the Gentleman to excuse it: if I should not be able 
whan I had need to pisse out of my doublet, and to do the rest in my 
netherstocks (vsing the plaine terme) all men would <pb n="238"/>
say I were but a lowte, the Councellor laughed hartily at the absurditie of 
the speech, but what would those fower fellowes of Rome haue said trowe 
ye? truely in mine opinion, that all such persons as take pleasure to shew 
their limbes, specially those that nature hath commanded out of sight, 
should be inioyned either to go starke naked, or else to resort back to the 
comely and modest fashion of their owne countrie apparell vsed by their old 
honorable auncestors. 


</p>
               <p>And there is a decency of apparrel in respect of the place where it is to be 
vsed: as, in the Court to be richely apparrelled: in the countrey to weare 
more plain &amp; homely garments. For who would not thinke it a ridiculous 
thing to see a Lady in her milke-house with a veluet gowne, and at a bridall 
in her cassock of mockado: a Gentleman of the Countrey among the bushes 
and briers, goe in a pounced dublet and a paire of embrodered hosen, in the 
Citie to weare a frise Ierkin and a paire of leather breeches? yet some such 
phantasticals haue I knowen, and one a certaine knight, of all other the most 
vaine, who commonly would come to the Sessions, and other ordinarie 
meetings and Commissions in the Countrey, so bedect with buttons and 
aglets of gold and such costly embroderies, as the poore plaine men of the 
Countrey called him (for his gaynesse) the golden knight. Another for the 
like cause was called Saint Sunday: I thinke at this day they be so farre 
spent, as either of them would be content with a good cloath cloake: and 
this came by want of discretion, to discerne and deeme right of decencie, 
which many Gentlemen doe wholly limite by the person or degree, where 
reason doeth it by the place and presence: which may be such as it might 
very well become a great Prince to weare courser apparrell than in another 
place or presence a meaner person. 


</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse in the vse of a garment many occasions alter the decencie, 
sometimes the qualitie of the person, sometimes of the case, otherwhiles 
the countrie custome, and often the constitution of lawes, and the very 
nature of vse it selfe. As for example a king and prince may vse rich and 
gorgious apparell decently, so cannot a meane person doo, yet if an herald of 
armes to whom a king giueth his gowne of cloth of gold, or to whom it was 
incident as a fee of his office, do were the same, he doth it decently, 
because such <pb n="239"/>
hath alwaies bene th'allowances of heraldes: but if such herald haue worne 
out, or sold, or lost that gowne, to buy him a new of the like stuffe with his 
owne mony and to weare it, is not decent in the eye and iudgement of them 
that know it. 


</p>
               <p>And the country custome maketh things decent in vse, as in Asia for all 
ment to weare long gownes both a foot and horsebacke: in Europa short 
gaberdins, or clokes, or iackets, euen for their vpper garments. The Turke 
and Persian to wear great tolibants of ten, fifteene, and twentie elles of 
linnen a peece vpon their heads, which can not be remooued: in Europe to 
were caps or hats, which vpon euery occasion of saluation we vse to put of, 
as a signe of reuerence. In th'East partes the men to make water couring 
like women, with vs standing at a wall. With them to congratulat and salute 
by giuing a becke with the head, or a bende of the bodie, with vs here in 
England, and in Germany, and all other Northerne parts of the world to shake 
handes. In France, Italie, and Spaine to embrace ouer the shoulder, vnder the 
armes, at the very knees, according the superiors degree. With vs the 
wemen giue their mouth to be kissed, in other places their cheek, in many 
places their hand, or in steed of an offer to the hand, to say these words 
<hi>Bezo los manos</hi>. And yet some others surmounting in all courtly 
ciuilitie 
will say, <hi>Los manos &amp; los piedes</hi>. And aboue that reach too, there 
be that 
will say to the Ladies, <hi>Lombra de sus pisadas</hi>, the shadow of your 
steps. 
Which I recite vnto you to shew the phrase of those courtly seruitours in 
yeelding the mistresses honour and reuerence. 


</p>
               <p>And it is seen that very particular vse of it selfe makes a matter of much 
decencie and vndecencie, without any countrey custome or allowance, as if 
one that hath many yeares worne a gowne shall come to be seen weare a 
iakquet or ierkin, or he that hath many yeares worne a beard or long haire 
among those that had done the contrary, and come sodainly to be pold or 
shauen, it will seeme onely to himselfe, a deshight and very vndecent, but 
also to all others that neuer vsed to go so, vntill the time and custome haue 
abrogated that mislike. 


</p>
               <p>So was it here in England till her Maiesties most noble father for diuers 
good respects, caused his owne head and all his Courtiers to be polled and 
his beard to be cut short. Before that time it <pb n="240"/>
was thought more decent both for old men and young to be all shauen and to 
weare long haire either rounded or square. Now againe at this time, the 
young Gentlemen of the Court haue taken vp the long haire trayling on their 
shoulders, and thinke it more decent: for what respect I would be glad to 
know. 


</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians bearing long bushes of haire, finely kept &amp; curled vp, 
vsed this ciuill argument to maintaine that custome. Haire (say they) is the 
very ornament of nature appointed for the head, which therefore to vse in 
his most sumptuous degree is comely, specially for them that be Lordes, 
Maisters of men, and of a free life, hauing abilitie &amp; leasure inough to 
keepe 
it cleane, and so for a signe of seignorie, riches and libertie, the masters of 
the Lacedemonians vsed long haire. But their vassals, seruaunts and slaues 
vsed it short or shauen in signe of seruitude and because they had no meane 
nor leasure to kembe and keepe it cleanely. It was besides combersome to 
them hauing many businesse to attende, in some seruices there might no 
maner of filth be falling from their heads. And to all souldiers it is very 
noysome and a daungerous disauantage in the warres or in any particular 
combat, which being the most comely profession of euery noble young 
Gentleman, it ought to perswade them greatly from wearing long haire. If 
there be any that seeke by long haire to helpe or to hide an ill featured face, 
it is in them allowable so to do, because euery man may decently reforme by 
art, the faultes and imperfections that nature hath wrought in them. 


</p>
               <p>And all singularities or affected parts of a mans behauiour seeme vndecent, 
as for one man to march or iet in the street more stately, or to looke more 
solempnely, or to go more gayly &amp; in other coulours or fashioned 
garments 
then another of the same degree and estate. 


</p>
               <p>Yet such singularities haue had many times both good liking and good 
successe, otherwise then many would haue looked for. As when 
<hi>Dinocrates</hi> the famous architect, desirous to be knowen to king 
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and hauing none acquaintance to bring him to the 
kings speech, he came one day to the Court very strangely apparelled in long 
skarlet robes, his head compast with a garland of Laurell, and his face all to 
be slicked with sweet oyle, and stoode in the kings chamber, motioning 
nothing to any man: <pb n="241"/>
newes of this stranger came to the king, who cause him to be brought to his 
presence, and asked his name, and the cause of his repaire to the Court. He 
aunswered, his name was <hi>Dinocrates</hi> the Architect, who came to 
present 
his Maiestie with a platforme of his owne deuising, how his Maiestie might 
buylde a Citie vpon the mountaine Athos in Macedonia, which should beare 
the figure of a mans body, and tolde him all how. Forsooth the breast and 
bulke of his body should rest vpon such a flat: that hil should be his head, 
all set with foregrowen woods like haire: his right arme should stretch out 
to such a hollow bottome as might be like his hand: holding a dish 
conteyning al the waters that should serue that Citie: the left arme with 
his hand should hold a valley of all the orchards and gardens of pleasure 
pertaining thereunto: and either legge should lie vpon a ridge of rocke, very 
gallantly to behold, and so should accomplish the full figure of a man. The 
king asked him what commoditie of soyle, or sea, or nauigable riuer lay 
neere vnto it, to be able to sustaine so great a number of inhabitants. 
Truely Sir (quoth <hi>Dinocrates</hi>) I haue not yet considered thereof: for in 
trueth it is the barest part of all the Countrey of Macedonia. The king 
smiled at it, and said very honourably, we like your deuice well, and meane 
to vse your seruice in the building of a Citie, but we wil chuse out a more 
commodious scituation: and made him attend in that voyage in which he 
conquered Asia and Egypt, and there made him chiefe Surueyour of his new 
Citie of Alexandria. Thus did <hi>Dinocrates</hi> singularitie in attire greatly 
further him to his aduancement. 


</p>
               <p>Yet are generally all rare things and such as breede maruell &amp; 
admiration 
somewhat holding of the vndecent, as when a man is bigger &amp; exceeding 
the 
ordinary stature of a man like a Giaunt, or farre vnder the reasonable and 
common size of men, as a dwarfe, and such vndecencies do not angre vs, but 
either we pittie them or scorne at them. 


</p>
               <p>But at all insolent and vnwoonted partes of a mans behauiour, we find many 
times cause to mislike or to be mistrustfull, which proceedeth of some 
vndecency that is in it, as when a man that hath alwaies bene strange &amp; 
vnacquainted with vs, will suddenly become our familiar and domestick: and 
another that hath bene <pb n="242"/>
alwaies sterne and churlish, wilbe vpon suddaine affable and curteous, it 
is neyther a comely sight, nor a signe of any good towardes vs. Which the 
subtill Italian well obserued by the successes thereof, saying in Prouerbe. 

<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Chi me fa meglio che non suole,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Traditio me ha o tradir me vuolo</hi>. 
 </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>He that speakes me fairer, than his woont was too</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Hath done me harme, or meanes for to doo</hi>. </l>
                  </q>


               </p>
               <p>Now againe all maner of conceites that stirre vp any vehement passion in a 
man, doo it by some turpitude or euill and vndecency that is in them, as to 
make a man angry there must be some iniury or contempt offered, to make 
him enuy there must proceede some vndeserued prosperitie of his egall or 
inferiour, to make him pitie some miserable fortune or spectakle to behold. 


</p>
               <p>And yet in euery of these passions being as it were vndecencies, there is a 
comelinesse to be discerned, which some men can keepe and some men can 
not, as to be angry, or to enuy, or to hate, or to pitie, or to be ashamed 
decently, that is none otherwise then reason requireth. This surmise 
appeareth to be true, for <hi>Homer</hi> the father of Poets writing that 
famous 
and most honourable poeme called the <hi>Illiades</hi> or warres of Troy: 
made 
his commencement the magnanimous wrath and anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> in 
his 
first verse thus: <foreign xml:lang="el">menyn hia piladeou axilleious</foreign> Sing foorth 
my muse the wrath of <hi>Achilles Peleus</hi> sonne: which the 
Poet would neuer haue done if the wrath of a prince had not beene in some 
sort comely &amp; allowable. but when <hi>Arrianus</hi> and <hi>Curtius</hi>
historiographers that wrote the noble gestes of king <hi>Alexander</hi> the 
great, came to prayse him for many things, yet for his wrath and anger they 
reproched him, because it proceeded not of any magnanimitie, but vpon 
surfet &amp; distemper in his diet, nor growing of any iust causes, was 
exercised to the destruction of his dearest friends and familiers, and not of 
his enemies, nor any other waies so honorably as th'others was, and so could 
not be reputed a decent and comely anger. 


</p>
               <p>So may al your other passions be vsed decently though the very matter of 
their originall be grounded vpon some vndecencie, as it is written by a 
certaine king of Egypt, who looking out of his <pb n="243"/>
window, and seing his owne sonne for some grieuous offence, carried by the 
officers of his iustice to the place of execution: he neuer once changed his 
countenance at the matter, though the sight were neuer so full of ruth and 
atrocitie. And it was thought a decent countenance and constant animositie 
in the king to be so affected, the case concerning so high and rare a peece of 
his owne iustice. But within few daies after when he beheld out of the same 
window an old friend and familiar of his, stand begging an almes in the 
streete, he wept tenderly, remembring their old familiarity and considering 
how by the mutabilitie of fortune and frailtie of mans estate, it might one 
day come to passe that he himselfe should fall into the like miserable 
estate. He therfore had a remorse very comely for a king in that behalfe, 
which also caused him to giue order for his poore friends plentiful reliefe. 


</p>
               <p>But generally to weepe for any sorrow (as one may doe for pitie) is not so 
decent in a man: and therefore all high minded persons, when they cannot 
chuse but shed teares, wil turne away their face as a countenance vndecent 
for a man to shew, and so will the standers by till they haue supprest such 
passion, thinking it nothing decent to behold such an vncomely countenance. 
But for Ladies and women to weepe and shed teares at euery little greefe, it 
is nothing vncomely, but rather a signe of much good nature &amp; meeknes 
of 
minde, a most decent propertie for that sexe; and therefore they be for the 
more part more deuout and charitable, and greater geuers of almes than men, 
and zealous relieuers of prisoners, and beseechers of pardons, and such like 
parts of commiseration. Yea they be more than so too: for by the common 
prouerbe, a woman will weepe for pitie to see a gosling goe barefoote. 


</p>
               <p>But most certainly all things that moue a man to laughter, as doe these 
scurrilities &amp; other ridiculous behauiours, it is for some vndecencie 
that is 
found in them: which maketh it decent for euery man to laugh at them. And 
therefore when we see or heare a natural foole and idiot doe or say any thing 
foolishly, we laugh not at him: but when he doeth or speaketh wisely, 
because that is vnlike him selfe: and a buffonne or counterfet foole, to 
heare him speake wisely which is like himselfe, it is no sport at all, but for 
such a counterfait to talke and looke foolishly it maketh vs laugh, <pb n="244"/>
because it is no part of his naturall, for in euery vncomlinesse there must 
be a certaine absurditie and disproportion to nature, and the opinion of the 
hearer or beholder to make the thing ridiculous. But for a foole to talke 
foolishly or a wiseman wisely, there is no such absurditie or disproportion. 


</p>
               <p>And though at all absurdities we may decently laugh, &amp; when they be no 
absurdities not decently, yet in laughing is there an vndecencie for other 
respectes sometime, than of the matter it selfe, Which made 
<hi>Philippus</hi>
sonne to the first Christen Emperour, <hi>Philippus Arabicus</hi> fitting with 
his 
father one day in the theatre to behold the sports, giue his father a great 
rebuke because he laughed, saying that it was no comely countenance for an 
Emperour to bewray in such a publicke place, nor specially to laugh at euery 
foolish toy: the posteritie gaue the sonne for that cause the name of 
<hi>Philippus Agelastos</hi> or without laughter. 


</p>
               <p>I haue seene forraine Embassadours in the Queenes presence laugh so 
dissolutely at some rare pastime or sport that hath beene made there, that 
nothing in the world could worse haue becomen them, and others very wise 
men, whether it haue ben of some pleasant humour and complexion, or for 
other default in the spleene, or for ill education or custome, that could not 
vtter any graue and earnest speech without laughter, which part was greatly 
discommended in them. 


</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cicero</hi> the wisest of any Romane writers, thought it vncomely for 
a 
man to daunce: saying, <hi>Saltantem sobrium vidi neminem</hi>. I neuer saw 
any man daunce that was sober and in his right wits, but there by your leaue 
he failed, nor our young Courtiers will allow it, besides that it is the most 
decent and comely demeanour of all exulatations and reioycements of the 
hart, which is no lesse naturall to man then to be wise or well learned, or 
sober. 


</p>
               <p>To tell you the decencies of a number of other behauiours, one might do it to 
please you with pretie reportes, but to the skilfull Courtiers it shalbe 
nothing necessary, for they know all by experience without learning. Yet 
some few remembraunces wee will make you of the most materiall, which 
our selues haue obserued, and so make an end. 


</p>
               <p>It is decent to be affable and curteous at meales &amp; meeting, in <pb n="245"/>
open assemblies more solemne and straunge, in place of authoritie and 
iudgement not familiar nor pleasant, in counsell secret and sad, in ordinary 
conferences easie and apert, in conuersation simple, in capitulation subtill 
and mistrustfull, at mournings and burials sad and sorrowfull, in feasts and 
bankets merry &amp; ioyfull, in houshold expence pinching and sparing, in 
publicke entertainement spending and pompous. The Prince to be sumptuous 
and magnificent, the priuate man liberall with moderation, a man to be in 
giuing free, in asking spare, in promise slow, in performance speedy, in 
contract circumspect but iust, in amitie sincere, in ennimitie wily and 
cautelous [<hi>dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirit</hi>, saith the Poet] and 
after 
the same rate euery sort and maner of businesse or affaire or action hath 
his decencie and vndecencie, either for the time or place or person or some 
other circumstaunce, as Priests to be sober and sad, a Preacher by his life 
to giue good example, a Iudge to be incorrupted, solitarie and vnacquainted 
with Courtiers or Courtly entertainements, &amp; as the Philosopher saith 
<hi>Oportet iudice esse rudem &amp; simplicem</hi>, without plaite or wrinkle, 
sower 
in looke and churlish in speach, contrariwise a Courtly Gentleman to be 
loftie and curious in countenaunce, yet sometimes a creeper and a curry 
fauell with his superiours. 


</p>
               <p>And touching the person, we say it is comely for a man to be a lambe in the 
house, and a Lyon in the field, appointing the decencie of his qualitie by the 
place, by which reason also we limit the comely parts of a woman to consist 
in foure points, that is to be a shrewe in the kitchin, a saint in the Church, 
an Angell at the bourd, and an Ape in the bed, as the Chronicle reportes by 
Mistresse <hi>Shore</hi> paramour to king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. 


</p>
               <p>Then also there is a decency in respect of the persons with whom we do 
negotiate, as with the great personages his egals to be solemne and surly, 
with meaner men pleasant and popular, stoute with the sturdie and milde 
with the meek, which is a most decent conuersation and not reprochfull or 
vnseemely, as the prouerbe goeth, by those that vse the contrary, a Lyon 
among sheepe and a sheepe among Lyons. 


</p>
               <p>Right so in negotiating with Princes we ought to seeke their fauour by 
humilitie &amp; not by sternnesse, nor to trafficke with them <pb n="246"/>
by way of indecent or condition, but frankly and by manner of submission to 
their wils, for Princes may be lead but not driuen, nor they are to be 
vanquisht by allegation, but must be suffred to haue the victorie and be 
relented vnto: nor they are not to be chalenged for right or iustice, for that 
is a maner of accusation: nor to be charged with their promises, for that is 
a kinde of condemnation: and at their request we ought not to be hardly 
entreated but easily, for that is a signe of deffidence and mistrust in their 
bountie and gratitude: nor to recite the good seruices which they haue 
receiued at our hands, for that is but a kind of exprobation, but in crauing 
their bountie or largesse to remember vnto them all their former 
beneficences, making no mention of our owne merites, &amp; so it is 
thankfull, 
and in praysing them to their faces to do it very modestly: and in their 
commendations not to be excessiue for that is tedious, and alwayes fauours 
of suttelty more then of sincere loue. 


</p>
               <p>And in speaking to a Prince the voyce ought to be lowe and not lowde nor 
shrill, for th'one is a signe of humilitie th'other of too much audacitie and 
presumption. Nor in looking on them seeme to ouerlooke them, nor yet 
behold them too stedfastly, for that is a signe of impudence or litel 
reuerence, and therefore to the great Princes Orientall their seruitours 
speaking or being spoken vnto abbase their eyes in token of lowlines, which 
behauiour we do not obserue to our Princes with so good a discretion as they 
do: &amp; such as retire from the Princes presence, do not by &amp; by 
turne tayle to 
them as we do, but go backward or sideling for a reasonable space, til they 
be at the wal or chamber doore passing out of sight, and is thought a most 
decent behauiour to their soueraignes. I haue heard that king <hi>Henry</hi>
th'eight her Maiesties father, though otherwise the most gentle and affable 
Prince of the world, could not abide to haue any man stare in his face or to 
fix his eye too steedily vpon him when he talked with them: nor for a 
common suter to exclame or cry out for iustice, for that is offensiue and as 
it were a secret impeachement of his wrong doing, as happened once to a 
Knight in this Realme of great worship speaking to the king. Nor in speaches 
with them to be too long, or too much affected, for th'one is tedious th'other 
is irksome, nor with lowd acclamations to applaude them, for that is too 
popular &amp; rude and <pb n="247"/>
betokens either ignoraunce, or seldome accesse to their presence, or little 
frequenting their Courts: nor to shew too mery or light a countenance, for 
that is a signe of little reuerence and is a peece of a contempt. 


</p>
               <p>And in gaming with a Prince it is decent to let him sometimes win of 
purpose, to keepe him pleasant, &amp; neuer to refuse his gift, for that is 
vndutifull: nor to forgiue him his losses, for that is arrogant: nor to giue 
him great gifts, for that is either insolence or follie: nor to feast him with 
excessiue charge for that is both vaine and enuious, &amp; therefore the 
wise 
Prince king <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth her Maiesties grandfather, if his 
chaunce 
had bene to lye at any of his subiects houses, or to passe moe meales then 
one, he that would take vpon him to defray the charge of his dyet, or of his 
officers and houshold, he would be maruelously offended with it, saying 
what priuate subiect dare vndertake a Princes charge, or looke into the 
secret of his expence? Her Maiestie hath bene knowne oftentimes to 
mislike the superfluous expence of her subiects bestowed vpon her in times 
of her progresses. 


</p>
               <p>Likewise in matter of aduise it is neither decent to flatter him for that is 
seruile, neither to be to rough or plaine with him, for it is daungerous, but 
truly to Counsell &amp; to admonish, grauely not greuously, sincerely not 
sourely: which was the part that so greatly commended <hi>Cineus</hi>
Counsellour to king <hi>Pirrhus</hi>, who kept that decencie in all his 
perswasions, that he euer preuailed in aduice, and carried the king which 
way he would. 


</p>
               <p>And in a Prince it is comely to giue vnasked, but in a subiect to aske 
vnbidden: for that first is signe of a bountifull mynde, this of a loyall &amp; 
confident. But the subiect that craues not at his Princes hand, either he is 
of no desert, or proud, or mistrustfull of his Princes goodnesse: therefore 
king <hi>Henry</hi> th'eight to one that entreated him to remember one Sir 
<hi>Anthony Rouse</hi> with some reward for that he had spent much and was 
an 
ill beggar: the king aunswered (noting his insolencie.) If he be ashamed to 
begge, we are ashamed to giue, and was neuerthelesse one of the most 
liberall Princes of the world. 


</p>
               <p>And yet in some Courts it is otherwise vsed, for in Spaine it is thought very 
vndecent for a Courtier to craue, supposing that it is <pb n="248"/>
the part of an importune: therefore the king of ordinarie calleth euery 
second, third or fourth yere for his Checker roll, and bestoweth his 
<hi>mercedes</hi> of his owne meere motion, and by discretion, according to 
euery mans merite and condition. 


</p>
               <p>And in their commendable delights to be apt and accommodate, as if the 
Prince be geuen to hauking, hunting, riding or horses, or playing vpon 
instruments, or any like exercise, the seruitour to be the same: and in their 
other appetites wherein the Prince would seeme and example of vertue, and 
would not mislike to be egalled by others: in such cases it is decent their 
seruitours &amp; subiects studie to be like to them by imitation, sa in 
wearing 
their haire long or short, or in this or that sort of apparrell, such excepted 
as be only fitte for Princes and none els, which were vndecent for a meaner 
person to imitate or counterfet: so is it not comely to counterfet their 
voice, or looke, or any other gestures that be not ordinary and naturall in 
euery common person: and therefore to go vpright or speake or looke 
assuredly, it is decent in euery man. But if the Prince haue an 
extraordinarie countenance or manner of speech, or bearing of his body, that 
for a common seruitour to counterfet is not decent, and therefore it was 
misliked in the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi>, and thought vncomely for him to 
counterfete <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, by holding his head a little awrie, 
&amp; 
neerer toward the tone shoulder, because it was not his owne naturall. 


</p>
               <p>And in a Prince it is decent to goe slowly, and to march with leysure, and 
with a certaine granditie rather than grauitie: as our soueraine Lady and 
mistresse, the very image of maiestie and magnificence, is accustomed to 
doe generally, vnlesse it be when she walketh apace for her pleasure, or to 
catch her a heate in the colde mornings. 


</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, it is not so decent in a meaner person, as I haue obserued in 
some counterfet Ladies of the Countrey, which vse it much to their owne 
derision. This comelines was wanting in Queene <hi>Marie</hi>, otherwise a 
very 
good and honourable Princesse. And was some blemish to the Emperor 
<hi>Ferdinando</hi>, a most noble minded man, yet so carelesse and forgetfull 
of 
himselfe in that behalfe, as I haue seene him runne vp a paire of staires so 
swift and nimble a pace, as almost had not become a very meane man, who <pb n="249"/>
had not gone in some hastie businesse. 


</p>
               <p>And in a noble Prince nothing is more decent and welbeseeming his 
greatnesse than to spare foule speeches, for that breedes hatred, and to let 
none humble suiters depart out of their presence (as neere as may be) 
miscontented. Wherein her Maiestie hath of all others a most Regall gift, 
and nothing inferior to the good Prince <hi>Titus Vespasianus</hi> in that 
point. 


</p>
               <p>Also, not to be passionate for small detriments or offences, nor to be a 
reuenger of them but in cases of great iniurie, and specially of dishonors: 
and therein to be very sterne and vindicatiue, for that fauours of Princely 
magnanimitie: nor to seeke reuenge vpon base and obscure persons, ouer 
whom the conquest is not glorious, nor the victorie honourable, which 
respect moued our soueraign Lady (keeping alwaies the decorum) of a 
Princely person) at her first comming to the crowne, when a knight of this 
Realme, who had very insolently behaued himselfe toward her when she was 
Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>, fell vpon his knee to her, and besought her pardon: 
suspecting (as there was good cause) that he should haue bene sent to the 
Tower, she said vnto him most mildly: do you not know that we are 
descended of the Lion, whose nature is not to harme or pray vpon the mouse, 
or any other such small vermin? 


</p>
               <p>And with these examples I thinke sufficient to leaue, geuing you information 
fo this one point, that all your figures Poeticall or Rhetoricall, are but 
obseruations of strange speeches and such as without any arte at al we 
should vse, &amp; commonly do, euen by very nature without discipline. But 
more or lesse aptly and decently, or scarcely, or aboundantly, or of this or 
that kind of figure, &amp; one of vs more then another, according to the 
disposition of our nature constitution of the heart, &amp; facilitie of each 
mans 
vtterance: so as we may forme: but arte aydeth the iudgement of his vse 
and application, which geues me occasion finally and for a full conclusion to 
this whole treatise, to enforme you in the next chapter how art should be 
vsed in all respects, and specially in this behalfe of language, and when the 
naturall is more commendable then the artificiall, and contrariwise.

               <head>That the good Poet or maker ought to dissemble his arte, and in what cases the artificiall is more commended then the naturall, and contrariwise.</head>
               <p>And now (most excellent Queene) hauing largely said of Poets &amp; Poesie, 
and 
about what matters they be employed: then of all the commended fourmes 
of Poemes, thirdly of metricall proportions, such as do appertaine to our 
vulgar arte: and last of all set forth the poeticall ornament consisting 
chiefly in the beautie and gallantnesse of his language and stile, and so haue 
apparelled him to our seeming, in all his gorgious habilliments, and pulling 
him first from the carte to the schoole, and from thence to the Court, and 
preferred him to your Maiesties seruice, in that place of great honour and 
magnificence to geue enterteinment to Princes, ladies of honour, 
Gentlewomen and Gentlemen, and by his many moodes of skill, to serue the 
many humors of men thither haunting and resorting, some by way of solace, 
some of serious aduise, and in matters aswell profitable as pleasant and 
honest. Wee haue in our humble conceit sufficiently perfourmed our promise 
or rather dutie to your Maiestie in the description of this arte, so alwaies 
as we leaue him not vnfurnisht of one peece that best beseemes that place 
of any other, and may serue as a principall good lesson for al good makers to 
beare continually in mind in the vsage of this science: which is, that being 
now lately become a Courtier he shew not himself a craftsman, &amp; merit 
to 
be disgraded, &amp; with scorne sent back againe to the shop, or other place 
of 
his first facultie and calling, but that so wisely and discreetly he behaue 
himselfe as he may worthily retaine the credit of his place, and profession 
of a very Courtier, which is in plaine termes, cunningly to be able to 
dissemble. But (if it please your Maiestie) may it not seeme inough for a 
Courtier to know how to weare a fether, and set his cappe a flaunt, his 
chaine <hi>enecharpe</hi>, a straight buskin <hi>al inglesse</hi>, a loose <hi>alo 
Turquesque</hi>, the cape <hi>alla Spaniola</hi>, the breech <hi>la 
Françoise</hi>, 
and by twentie maner of new fashioned garments to disguise his body, and 
his face with as many countenances, whereof it seemes there be many that 
make a very arte, and studie who can shew himselfe most fine, I will not 
say most foolish and ridiculous? or perhaps <pb n="251"/>
rather that he could dissemble his conceits as well as his countenances, so 
as he neuer speake as he thinkes, or thinke as he speaks, and that in any 
matter of importance his words and his meaning very seldome meete: for so 
as I remember it was concluded by vs setting foorth the figure 
<hi>Allegoria</hi>, 
which therefore not impertinently we call the Courtier or figure of faire 
semblant, or is ti not perchance more requisite our courtly Poet do 
dissemble not onely his countenances &amp; conceits, but also all his 
ordinary 
actions of behauiour, or the most part of them, whereby the better to winne 
his purposes &amp; good aduantages, as now &amp; then to haue a iourney or 
sicknesse in his sleeue, thereby to shake of other importunities of greater 
consequence, as they vse their pilgrimages in Fraunce, the Diet in Spaine, 
the baines in Italy? and when a man is whole to faine himselfe sicke to 
shunne the businesse in Court, to entertaine time and ease at home, to salue 
offences without discredite, to win purposes by mediation in absence, which 
their presence would eyther impeach or not greatly preferre, to harken after 
the popular opinions and speech, to entend to their more priuate solaces, to 
practize more deepely both at leasure &amp; libertie, &amp; when any 
publique 
affaire or other attempt &amp; counsaile of theirs hath not receaued good 
successe, to auoid therby the Princes present reproofe, to coole their 
chollers by absence, to winne remorse by lamentable reports, and 
reconciliation by friends intreatie. Finally by sequestring themselues for a 
time from the Court, to be able the freelier &amp; cleerer to discerne the 
factions and state of the Court and of al the world besides, no lesse then 
doth the looker on or beholder of a game better see into all points of 
auauntage, then the player himselfe? and in dissembling of diseases which I 
pray you? for I haue obserued it in the Court of Fraunce, not a burning feuer 
or a plurisie, or a palsie or the hydropick and swelling gowte, or any other 
like disease, for if they may be such as may be either easily discerned or 
quickly cured, they be ill to dissemble and doo halfe handsomly or serue the 
turne. 


</p>
               <p>But it must be either a dry dropsie, or a megrim or letarge, or a fistule <hi>in 
ano</hi>, or some such other secret disease, as the common conuersant can 
hardly discouer, and the Phisition either not speedily heale, or not honestly 
bewray? of which infirmities the scoffing <pb n="252"/>
                  <hi>Pasquil</hi> wrote, <hi>Vleus vesicae renum dolor in pene scirrus</hi>. Or 
as I 
haue seene in diuers places where many make themselues hart whole, when 
in deede they are full sicke, bearing it stoutly out to the hazard of their 
health, rather then they would be suspected of any lothsome infirmity, 
which might inhibit them from the Princes presence, or enterteinment of 
the ladies. Or as some other do to beare a port of state &amp; plentie when 
they 
haue neither penny nor possession, that they may not seeme to droope, and 
be reiected as vnworthy or insufficient for the greater seruices, or be pitied 
for their pouertie, which they hold for a marueilous disgrace as did the 
poore Squire of Castile, who had rather dine with a sheepes head at home 
&amp; 
drinke a cruse of water to it, then to haue a good dinner giuen him by his 
friend who was nothing ignorant of his pouertie. Or as others do to make 
wise they be poore when they riche, to shunne thereby the publicke charges 
and vocations, for men are not now a dayes (specially in states of 
<hi>Oligarchie</hi> as the most in our age) called so much for their wisedome 
as 
for their wealth, also to auoyde enuie of neighbours or bountie in 
conuersation, for whosoeuer is reputed rich cannot without reproch, but be 
either a lender or a spender. Or as others do to seeme very busie when they 
haue nothing to doo, and yet will make themselues so occupied and ouerladen 
in the Princes affaires, as it is a great matter to haue a couple of wordes 
with them, when notwithstanding they lye sleeping on their beds all an after 
noone, or sit solemnly at cardes in their chambers, or enterteyning of the 
Dames, or laughing and gibing with their familiars foure houres by the 
clocke, whiles the poore suter desirous of his dispatch is aunswered by 
some Secretarie or page <hi>il fault attendre, Monsieur</hi> is dispatching the 
kings businesse into Languedock, Prouence, Piemont, a common phrase with 
the Secretaries of France. Or as I haue obserued in many of the Princes 
Courts of Italie, to seeme idle when they be earnestly occupied &amp; 
entend to 
noting but mischieuous practizes, and do busily negotiat by coulor of 
otiation. Or as others of them that go ordinarily to Church and neuer pray to 
winne an opinion of holinesse: or pray still apace, but neuer do good deede, 
and geue a begger a penny and spend a pound on a harlot, to speake faire to a 
mans face, and foule behinde his backe, to set him at his trencher and yet <pb n="253"/>
sit on his skirts for sowe vse to say by a fayned friend, then also to be 
rough and churlish in speach and apparance, but inwardly affectionate and 
fauouring, as I haue sene of the greatest podestates and grauest iudges and 
Presidentes of Parliament in Fraunce. 


</p>
               <p>These &amp; many such like disguisings do we find in mans behauiour, &amp; 
specially in the Courtiers of forraine Countreyes, where in my youth I was 
brought vp, and very well obserued their maner of life and conuersation, for 
of mine owne Countrey I haue not made so great experience. Which parts, 
neuerthelesse, we allow not now in our English maker, because we haue 
geuen him the name of an honest man, and not of an hypocrite: and therefore 
leauing these manner of dissimulations to all base-minded men &amp; of 
vile 
nature or misterie, we doe allow our Courtly Poet to be a dissembler only in 
the subtilties of his arte: that is, when he is most artificiall, so to 
disguise and cloake it as it may not appeare, nor seeme to proceede from 
him by any studie or trade of rules, but to be his naturall: nor so euidently 
to be descried, as euery ladde that reades him shall say he is a good 
scholler, but will rather haue him to know his arte well, and little to vse it. 


</p>
               <p>And yet peraduenture in all points it may not be so taken, but in such onely 
as may discouer his grossenes or his ignorance by some schollerly 
affectation: which thing is very irkesome to all men of good trayning, and 
specially to Courtiers. And yet for all that our maker may not be in all 
cases restrayned, but that he may both vse, and also manifest his arte to his 
great praies, and need not shoe, or a Carpenter to haue buylt a faire house. 
Therefore to discusse and make this point somewhat cleerer, to weete, 
where arte ought to appeare, and where not, and when the naturall is more 
commendable than the artificiall in any humane action or workmanship, we 
wil examine it further by this distinction. 


</p>
               <p>In some cases we say arte is an ayde and coadiutor to nature, and a 
furtherer of her actions to a good effect, or peraduenture a meane to supply 
her wants, by renforcing the causes wherein shee is impotent and defectiue, 
as doth the arte of phisicke, by helping the naturall and concoction, 
retention, distribution, expulsion, and other vertues, in a weake and 
vnhealthie bodie. Or as the good gardiner <pb n="254"/>
seasons his soyle by sundrie sorts of compost: as mucke or marle, 
clay or sande, and many times by bloud, or lesse of oyle or wine, or stale, or 
perchaunce with more costly drugs: and waters his plants, and weedes his 
herbes and floures, and prunes his branches, and vnleaues his boughes to let 
in the sunne: and twentie other waies cherisheth them, and cureth their 
infirmities, and so makes that neuer, or very seldome any of them miscarry, 
but bring foorth their flours and fruites in season. And in both these cases 
it is no final praise for the Phisition &amp; Gardiner to be called good and 
cunning artificers. 


</p>
               <p>In another respect arte is not only an aide and coadiutor to nature in all her 
actions, but an alterer of them, and in some sort a surmounter of her skill, 
so as by meanes of it her owne effects shall appeare more beautifull or 
straunge and miraculous, as in both cases before remembred. The Phisition 
by the cordials hee will geue his patient, shall be able not onely to restore 
the decayed spirites of man, and render him health, but also to prolong the 
terme of his life many yeares ouer and aboue the stint of his first and 
naturall constitution. And the Gardiner by his arte will not onely make an 
herbe, or flowr, or fruite, come forth in his season without impediment, but 
also will embellish the same in vertue, shape, odour and taste, that nature 
of her selfe woulde neuer haue done: as to make the single gillifloure, or 
marigold, or daisie, double: and the white rose, redde, yellow, or carnation, 
a bitter mellon sweete; a sweete apple, soure; a plumme or cherrie without 
a stone; a peare without core or kernell, a goord or coucumber like to a 
horne, or any other figure he will: any of which things nature could not doe 
without mans help and arte. These actions also are most singular, when 
they be most artificiall. 


</p>
               <p>In another respecte, we say arte is neither an aider nor a surmounter, but 
onely a bare immitatour of natures works, following and counterfeyting her 
actions and effects, as the Marmelot doth many countenances and gestures 
of man, of which sorte are the artes of painting and keruing, whereof one 
represents the naturall by light colour and shadow in the superficiall or 
flat, the other in a body massife expressing the full and emptie, euen, 
extant, rabbated, hollow, or whatsoeuer other figure and passion of 
quantitie. <pb n="255"/>
So also the Alchimist counterfeits gold, siluer, and all other mettals, the 
Lapidarie pearles and pretious stones by glasse and other substances 
falsified, and sophisticate by arte. These men also be praised for their 
craft, and their credit is nothing empayred, to say that their conclusions and 
effects are very artificiall. Finally in another respect arte is as it were an 
encountrer and contrary to nature, production effects neither like to hers, 
nor by participation with her operations, nor by imitation of her paternes, 
but makes things and produceth effects altogether strange and diuerse, 
&amp; of 
such forme &amp; qualitie (nature alwaies supplying stuffe) as she neuer 
would 
nor could haue done of her selfe, as the carpenter that builds a house, the 
ioyner that makes a table or a bedstead, the tailor a garment, the Smith a 
locke or a key, and a number of like, in which case the workman gaineth 
reputation by his arte, and praise when it is best expressed &amp; most 
apparant, &amp; most studiously. Man also in all his actions that be not 
altogether naturall, but are gotten by study &amp; discipline or exercise, as 
to 
daunce by measures to sing by note, to play on the lute, and such like, it is a 
praise to be said an artificiall dauncer, singer, &amp; player on instruments, 
because they be not exactly knowne or done, but by rules &amp; precepts or 
teaching of schoolemasters. But in such actions as be so naturall &amp; 
proper 
to man, as he may become excellent therein without any arte or imitation at 
all, (custome and exercise excepted, which are requisite to euery action not 
numbred among the vitall or animal) and wherein nature should seeme to do 
amisse, and man suffer reproch to be found destitute of them: in those to 
shew himselfe rather artificiall then naturall, were no lesse to be laughed 
at, then for one that can see well inough, to vse a paire of spectacles, or not 
to heare but by a trunke put to his eare, nor feele without a paire of 
ennealed glooues, which things in deed helpe an infirme sence, but annoy the 
perfit, and therefore shewing a disabilitie naturall mooue rather to scorne 
then commendation, and to pitie sooner then to prayse. But what else is 
language and vtterance, and discourse &amp; perswasion, and argument in 
man, 
then the vertues of a well constitute body and minde, little lesse naturall 
then his very sensuall actions, sauing that the one is perfited by nature at 
once, the other not without exercise &amp; iteration? Peraduenture also it 
wilbe granted, <pb n="256"/>
that a man sees better and discernes more brimly his collours, and 
heares and feeles more exactly by vse and often hearing and feeling and 
seing, &amp; though it be better to see with spectacles then not to see at 
all, ye 
tis their praise not egall nor in any mans iudgement comparable: no more is 
that which a Poet makes by arte and precepts rather then by naturall 
instinct: and that which he doth by long meditation rather then by a 
suddaine inspiration, or with great pleasure and facillitie then hardly (and 
as they are woont to say) in spire of Nature or Minerua, then which nothing 
can be more irksome or ridiculous. 


</p>
               <p>And yet I am not ignorant that there be artes and methodes both to speake 
and to perswade and also to dispute, and by which the naturall is in some 
sorte relieued, as th'eye by his spectacle, I say relieued in his imperfection, 
but not made more perfit then the naturall, in which respect I call those 
artes of Grammer, <hi>Logicke</hi>, and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> not bare imitations, 
as the 
painter or keruers craft and worke in a forraine subiect viz. a liuely 
purtraite in his table of wood, but by long and studious obseruation rather a 
repetition or reminiscens naturall, reduced into perfection, and made prompt 
by vse and exercise. And so whatsoeuer a man speakes or perswades he doth 
it not by imitation artificially, but by obseruation naturally (though one 
follow another) because it is both the same and the like that nature doth 
suggest: but if a popingay speake, she doth it by imitation of mans voyce 
artificially and not naturally being the like, but not the same that nature 
doth suggest to man. But now because our maker or Poet is to play many 
parts and not one alone, as first to deuise his plat or subiect, then to 
fashion his poeme thirdly to vse his metricall proportions, and last of all to 
vtter with pleasure and delight, which restes in his maner of language and 
stile as hath bene said, whereof the many moodes and straunge phrase are 
called figures, it is not altogether with him as with the crafts man, nor 
altogither otherwise then with the crafts man, for in that he vseth his 
metricall proportions by appointed and harmonicall measures and 
distaunces, he is like the Carpenter or Ioynder, for borrowing their tymber 
and stuffe of nature, they appoint and order it by art otherwise then nature 
would doe, and worke effects in apparance contrary to hers. Also in that <pb n="257"/>
which the Poet speakes or reports of another mans tale or doings, as 
<hi>Homer</hi> of <hi>Priamus</hi> or <hi>Vlisses</hi>, he is as the painter or 
keruer that worke by imitation and representation in a forrein subiect, in 
that he speakes figuratiuely, or argues subtillie, or perswades copiously and 
vehemently, he doth as the cunning gardiner that vsing nature as a coadiutor, 
furders her conclusions &amp; many times makes her effectes more absolute 
and straunge. But for that in our maker or Poet, which restes onely in 
deuise and issues from an excellent sharpe and quick inuention, holpen by a 
cleare and bright phantasie and imagination, he is not as the painter to 
counterfaite the naturall by the like effects and not the same, nor as the 
gardiner aiding nature to worke both the same and the like, nor as the 
Carpenter to worke effectes vtterly vnlike, but euen as nature her selfe 
working by her owne peculiar vertue and proper instinct and not by example 
or meditation or exercise as all other artificers do, is then most admired 
when he is most naturall and least artificiall. And in the feastes of his 
language and vtterance, because they hold aswell of nature to be suggested 
and vttered as by arte to be polished and reformed. Therefore shall our Poet 
receaue prayse for both, but more by knowing of his arte then by 
vnseasonable vsing it, and be more commended for his naturall eloquence 
then for his artificiall well desembled, then for the same ouermuch affected 
and grossely or vndiscretly bewrayed, as many makers and Oratours do.

               <p>And with this (my most gratious soueraigne Lady) I make an end, humbly 
beseeching your pardon, in that I haue presumed to hold your eares so long 
annoyed with a tedious trifle, so as vnlesse it proceede more of your owne 
Princely and naturall mansuetude then of my merite, I feare greatly least 
you may thinck of me as the Philosopher Plato did of <hi>Aniceris</hi> an 
inhabitant of the City <hi>Cirene</hi>, who being in troth a very actiue and 
artificiall man in driuing of a Princes Charriot or Coche (as your Maiestie 
might be) and knowing it himselfe well enough, comming one day into Platos 
schoole, and hauing heard him largely dispute in matters <pb n="258"/>
Philosophicall, I pray you (quoth he) geue me leaue also to say somewhat of 
myne arte, and in deede shewed so many trickes of his cunning how to lanche 
forth and stay, and chaunge pace, and turne and winde his Coche, this way 
and that way, vphill downe hill, and also in euen or rough ground, that 
he made the whole assemblie wonder at him. Quoth Plato being a graue 
personage, verely in myne opinion this man should be vtterly vnfit for any 
seruice of greater importance then to driue a Coche. It is great pitie that so 
prettie a fellow, had not occupied his braynes in studies of more 
consequence. Now I pray God it be not thought so of me in describing the 
toyes of this our vulgar art. But when I consider how euery thing hath his 
estimation by oportunitie, and that it was but the studie of my yonger 
yeares in which vanitie raigned. Also that I write to the pleasure of a Lady 
and a most gratious Queene, and neither to Priestes nor to Prophetes or 
Philosophers. Besides finding by experience, that many times idlenesse is 
lesse harmefull then vnprofitable occupation, dayly seeing how these great 
aspiring mynds and ambitious heads of the world seriously searching to 
deale in matters of state, be often times so busie and earnest that they 
were better be vnoccupied, and peraduenture altogether idle, I presume so 
much vpon your Maiesties most milde and gracious iudgement howsoeuer you 
conceiue of myne abilitie to any better or greater seruice, that yet this 
attempt ye wil allow of my loyall and good intent alwayes endeuouring to do 
your Maiestie the best and greatest of those seruices I can.
