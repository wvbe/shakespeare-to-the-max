            <byline>Dedication from The Five Nations</byline>
            <byline>1903</byline>
            <p>BEFORE a midnight breaks in storm,<lb/>
 Or herded sea in wrath,<lb/>
Ye know what wavering gusts inform<lb/>
 The greater tempest’s path?<lb/>
  Till the loosed wind<lb/>
  Drive all from mind,<lb/>
Except Distress, which, so will prophets cry,<lb/>
O’ercame them, houseless, from the unhintmg sky,</p>
            <p>Ere rivers league against the land<lb/>
 In piratry of flood,<lb/>
Ye know what waters steal and stand<lb/>
 Where seldom water stood.<lb/>
  Yet who will note,<lb/>
  Till fields afloat,<lb/>
And washen carcass and the returning well,<lb/>
Trumpet what these poor heralds strove to tell?</p>
            <p>Ye know who use the Crystal Ball<lb/>
 (To peer by stealth on Doom),<lb/>
The Shade that, shaping first of all,<lb/>
 Prepares an empty room.<lb/>
  Then doth It pass<lb/>
  Like breath from glass,<lb/>
But, on the extorted vision bowed intent,<lb/>
No man considers why It came or went.</p>
            <p>Before the years reborn behold<lb/>
 Themselves with stranger eye,<lb/>
And the sport-making Gods of old, .<lb/>
 Like Samson slaying, die,<lb/>
  Many shall hear<lb/>
  The all-pregnant sphere,<lb/>
Bow to the birth and sweat, but — speech denied —<lb/>
Sit dumb or — dealt in part — fall weak and wide.</p>
            <p>Yet instant to fore-shadowed need<lb/>
 The eternal balance swings;<lb/>
That winged men the Fates may breed<lb/>
 So soon as Fate hath wings.<lb/>
  These shall possess<lb/>
  Our littleness,<lb/>
And in the imperial task (as worthy) lay<lb/>
Up our lives’ all to piece one giant Day.</p>

            <byline>1902</byline>
            <p>WHO hath desired the Sea?— the sight of salt water unbounded —<lb/>
The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?<lb/>
The sleek-barrelled swell before storm, grey, foamless, enormous, and growing —<lb/>
Stark calm on the lap of the Line or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing —<lb/>
His Sea in no showing the same — his Sea and the same ’neath each showing:<lb/>
   His Sea as she slackens or thrills?<lb/>
So and no otherwise — so and no otherwise — hillmen desire their Hills!</p>
            <p>Who hath desired the Sea?— the immense and contemptuous surges?<lb/>
The shudder, the stumble, the swerve, as the star-stabbing bowsprit emerges?<lb/>
The orderly clouds of the Trades, the ridged, roaring sapphire thereunder —<lb/>
Unheralded cliff-haunting flaws and the headsail’s low-volleying thunder —<lb/>
His Sea in no wonder the same — his Sea and the same through each wonder:<lb/>
   His Sea as she rages or stills?<lb/>
So and no otherwise — so and no otherwise — hillmen desire their Hills.</p>
            <p>Who hath desired the Sea? Her menaces swift as her mercies?<lb/>
The in-rolling walls of the fog and the silver-winged breeze that disperses?<lb/>
The unstable mined berg going South and the calvings and groans that declare it<lb/>
White water half-guessed overside and the moon breaking timely to bare it;<lb/>
His Sea as his fathers have dared-his Sea as his children shall dare it:—<lb/>
   His Sea as she serves him or kills?<lb/>
So and no otherwise — so and no otherwise — hillmen desire their Hills.</p>
            <p>Who hath desired the Sea? Her excellent loneliness rather<lb/>
Than forecourts of kings, and tier outermost pits than the streets where men gather<lb/>
Inland, among dust, under trees — inland where the slayer may slay him —<lb/>
Inland, out of reach of her arms, and the bosom whereon he must lay him —<lb/>
His Sea from the first that betrayed — at the last that shall never betray him:<lb/>
   His Sea that his being fulfils?<lb/>
So and no otherwise — so and no otherwise — hillmen desire their Hills.</p>

            <p>THEY christened my brother of old —<lb/>
 And a saintly name he bears —<lb/>
They gave him his place to hold<lb/>
 At the head of the belfry-stairs,<lb/>
 Where the minster-towers stand<lb/>
And the breeding kestrels cry.<lb/>
 Would I change with my brother a league inland?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not I!</p>
            <p>In the flush of the hot June prime,<lb/>
 O’er sleek flood-tides afire,<lb/>
I hear him hurry the chime<lb/>
 To the bidding of checked Desire;<lb/>
 Till the sweated ringers tire<lb/>
And the wild bob-majors die.<lb/>
 Could I wait for my turn in the godly choir?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not I !</p>
            <p>When the smoking scud is blown —<lb/>
 When the greasy wind-rack lowers —<lb/>
Apart and at peace and alone,<lb/>
 He counts the changeless hours.<lb/>
 He wars with darkling Powers<lb/>
(I war with a darkling sea);<lb/>
 Would he stoop to my work in the gusty mirk?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not he!</p>
            <p>There was never a priest to pray,<lb/>
 There was never a hand to toll,<lb/>
When they made me guard of the bay,<lb/>
 And moored me over the shoal.<lb/>
 I rock, I reel,, and I roll —<lb/>
My four great hammers ply —<lb/>
 Could I speak or be still at the Church’s will?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not I!</p>
            <p>The landward marks have failed,<lb/>
 The fog-bank glides unguessed,<lb/>
The seaward lights are veiled,<lb/>
 The spent deep feigns her rest:<lb/>
 But my ear is laid to her breast,<lb/>
I lift to the swell — I cry!<lb/>
 Could I wait in sloth on the Church’s oath?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not I!</p>
            <p>At the careless end of night<lb/>
 I thrill to the nearing screw;<lb/>
I turn in the clearing light<lb/>
 And I call to the drowsy crew;<lb/>
 And the mud boils foul and blue<lb/>
As the blind bow backs away.<lb/>
 Will they give me their thanks if they clear the banks?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not they!</p>
            <p>The beach-pools cake and skim,<lb/>
 The bursting spray-heads freeze,<lb/>
I gather on crown and rim<lb/>
 The grey, grained ice of the seas,<lb/>
 Where, sheathed from bitt to trees,<lb/>
The plunging colliers lie.<lb/>
 Would I barter my place for the Church’s grace?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not I!</p>
            <p>Through the blur of the whirling snow,<lb/>
 Or the black of the inky sleet,<lb/>
The lanterns gather and grow,<lb/>
 And I look for the homeward fleet.<lb/>
 Rattle of block and sheet —<lb/>
“Ready about — stand by!”<lb/>
 Shall I ask them a fee ere they fetch the quay?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not I!</p>
            <p>I dip and I surge and I swing<lb/>
 In the rip of the racing tide,<lb/>
By the gates of doom I sing,<lb/>
 On the horns of death I ride.<lb/>
 A ship-length overside,<lb/>
Between the course and the sand,<lb/>
 Fretted and bound I bide<lb/>
   Peril whereof I cry.<lb/>
 Would I change with my brother a league inland?<lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Shoal! ’Ware shoal!</hi>) Not I!</p>

            <byline>1899</byline>
            <p>AS OUR mother the Frigate, bepainted and fine,<lb/>
Made play for her bully the Ship of the Line;<lb/>
So we, her bold daughters by iron and fire,<lb/>
Accost and decoy to our masters’ desire.</p>
            <p>Now, pray you, consider what toils we endure,<lb/>
Night-walking wet sea-lanes, a guard and a lure;<lb/>
Since half of our trade is that same pretty sort<lb/>
As mettlesome wenches do practise in port.</p>
            <p>For this is our office: to spy and make room,<lb/>
As hiding yet guiding the foe to their doom.<lb/>
Surrounding, confounding, we bait and betray<lb/>
And tempt them to battle the seas’ width away.</p>
            <p>The pot-bellied merchant foreboding no wrong<lb/>
With headlight and sidelight he lieth along,<lb/>
Till, lightless and lightfoot and lurking, leap we<lb/>
To force him discover his business by sea.</p>
            <p>And when we have wakened the lust of a foe,<lb/>
To draw him by flight toward our bullies we go,<lb/>
Till, ’ware of strange smoke stealing nearer, he flies<lb/>
Or our bullies close in for to make him good prize.</p>
            <p>So, when we have spied on the path of their host,<lb/>
One flieth to carry that word to the coast;<lb/>
And, lest by false doublings they turn and go free,<lb/>
One lieth behind them to follow and see.</p>
            <p>Anon we return, being gathered again,<lb/>
Across the sad valleys all drabbled with rain —<lb/>
Across the grey ridges all crisped and curled —<lb/>
To join the long dance round the curve of the world.</p>
            <p>The bitter salt spindrift, the sun-glare likewise,<lb/>
The moontrack a-tremble, bewilders our eyes,<lb/>
Where, linking and lifting, our sisters we hail<lb/>
’Twixt wrench of cross-surges or plunge of head-gale.</p>
            <p>As maidens awaiting the bride to come forth<lb/>
Make play with light jestings and wit of no worth,<lb/>
So,widdershins circling the bride-bed of death,<lb/>
Each fleereth her neighbour and signeth and saith:—</p>
            <p>“What see ye? Their signals, or levin afar?<lb/>
“What hear ye? God’s thunder, or guns of our war?<lb/>
“What mark ye? Their smoke, or the cloud-rack outblown?<lb/>
“What chase ye? Their lights, or the Daystar low down?”</p>
            <p>So, times past all number deceived by false shows,<lb/>
Deceiving we cumber the road of our foes,<lb/>
For this is our virtue: to track and betray;<lb/>
Preparing great battles a sea’s width away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Now peace is at end and our peoples take heart,<lb/>
For the laws are clean gone that restrained our art;<lb/>
Up and down the near headlands and against the far wind<lb/>
We are loosed (O be swift!) to the work of our kind!</hi>

We will blame it on the deep (for the watch must have their sleep),<lb/>

Most resolute — a damsel unto each —<lb/>

      (Foul weather!)<lb/>
Though we know their voyage is vain, yet we see our path again<lb/>
 In the saffroned bridesails scenting all the seas! (Foul weather!)</p>

            <head>The Dykes</head>
            <byline>1902</byline>
            <p>WE HAVE no heart for the fishing, we have no hand for the oar —<lb/>
All that our fathers taught us of old pleases us now no more;<lb/>
All that our own hearts bid us believe we doubt where we do not deny —<lb/>
There is no proof in the bread we eat or rest in the toil we ply.</p>
            <p>Look you, our foreshore stretches far through sea-gate, dyke, and groin —<lb/>
Made land all, that our fathers made, where the flats and the fairway join.<lb/>
They forced the sea a sea-league back. They died, and their work stood fast.<lb/>
We were born to peace in the lee of the dykes, but the time of our peace is past.</p>
            <p>Far off, the full tide clambers and slips, mouthing and testing all,<lb/>
Nipping the flanks of the water-gates, baying along the wall;<lb/>
Turning the shingle, returning the shingle, changing the set of the sand . . .<lb/>
We are too far from the beach, men say, to know how the outworks stand.</p>
            <p>So we come down, uneasy, to look, uneasily pacing the beach.<lb/>
These are the dykes our fathers made: we have never known a breach.<lb/>
Time and again has the gale blown by and we were not afraid;<lb/>
Now we come only to look at the dykes — at the dykes our fathers made.</p>
            <p>O’er the marsh where the homesteads cower apart the harried sunlight flies,<lb/>
Shifts and considers, wanes and recovers, scatters and sickens and dies —<lb/>
An evil ember bedded in ash — a spark blown west by the wind . . .<lb/>
We are surrendered to night and the sea — the gale and the tide behind!</p>
            <p>At the bridge of the lower saltings the cattle gather and blare,<lb/>
Roused by the feet of running men, dazed by the lantern glare.<lb/>
Unbar and let them away for their lives — the levels drown as they stand,<lb/>
Where the flood-wash forces the sluices aback and the ditches deliver inland.</p>
            <p>Ninefold deep to the top of the dykes the galloping breakers stride,<lb/>
And their overcarried spray is a sea — a sea on the landward side.<lb/>
Coming, like stallions they paw with their hooves, going they snatch with their teeth,<lb/>
Till the bents and the furze and the sand are dragged out, and the old-time hurdles beneath.</p>
            <p>Bid men gather fuel for fire, the tar, the oil and the tow —<lb/>
Flame we shall need, not smoke, in the dark if the riddled seabanks go.<lb/>
Bid the ringers watch in the tower (who knows how the dawn shall prove?)<lb/>
Each with his rope between his feet and the trembling bells above.</p>
            <p>Now we can only wait till the day, wait and apportion our shame.<lb/>
These are the dykes our fathers left, but we would not look to the same.<lb/>
Time and again were we warned of the dykes, time and again we delayed:<lb/>
Now, it may fall, we have slain our sons, as our fathers we have betrayed.</p>
            <p>. . . . .</p>
            <p>Walking along the wreck of the dykes, watching the work of the seas!<lb/>
These were the dykes our fathers made to our great profit and ease.<lb/>
But the peace is gone and the profit is gone, with the old sure days withdrawn . . .<lb/>
That our own houses show as strange when we come back in the dawn!</p>

            <head>The Song of Diego Valdez</head>
            <byline>1902</byline>
            <p>THE GOD of Fair Beginnings<lb/>
 Hath prospered here my hand —<lb/>
The cargoes of my lading,<lb/>
 And the keels of my command.<lb/>
For out of many ventures<lb/>
 That sailed with hope as high,<lb/>
My own have made the better trade,<lb/>
 And Admiral am I.</p>
            <p>To me my King’s much honour,<lb/>
 To me my people’s love —<lb/>
To me the pride of Princes<lb/>
 And power all pride above;<lb/>
To me the shouting cities,<lb/>
 To me the mob’s refrain:—<lb/>
“Who knows not noble Valdez,<lb/>
 Hath never heard of Spain.”</p>
            <p>But I remember comrades —<lb/>
 Old playmates on new seas —<lb/>
Whenas we traded orpiment<lb/>
 Among the savages —<lb/>
A thousand leagues to south’ard<lb/>
 And thirty years removed —<lb/>
They knew not noble Valdez,<lb/>
 But me they knew and loved.</p>
            <p>Then they that found good liquor,<lb/>
 They drank it not alone,<lb/>
And they that found fair plunder,<lb/>
 They told us every one,<lb/>
About our chosen islands<lb/>
 Or secret shoals between,<lb/>
When, weary from far voyage,<lb/>
 We gathered to careen.</p>
            <p>There burned our breaming-fagots<lb/>
 All pale along the shore:<lb/>
There rose our worn pavilions —<lb/>
 A sail above an oar;<lb/>
As flashed each yearning anchor<lb/>
 Through mellow seas afire,<lb/>
So swift our careless captains<lb/>
 Rowed each to his desire.</p>
            <p>Where lay our loosened harness?<lb/>
 Where turned our naked feet?<lb/>
Whose tavern ’mid the palm-trees?<lb/>
 What quenchings of what heat?<lb/>
Oh fountain in the desert!<lb/>
 Oh cistern in the waste!<lb/>
Oh bread we ate in secret!<lb/>
 Oh cup we spilled in haste!</p>
            <p>The youth new-taught of longing<lb/>
 The widow curbed and wan,<lb/>
The goodwife proud at season,<lb/>
 And the maid aware of man —<lb/>
All souls unslaked, consuming,<lb/>
 Defrauded in delays,<lb/>
Desire not more their quittance<lb/>
 Than I those forfeit days!</p>
            <p>I dreamed to wait my pleasure<lb/>
 Unchanged my spring would bide:<lb/>
Wherefore, to wait my pleasure,<lb/>
 I put my spring aside<lb/>
Till, first in face of Fortune,<lb/>
 And last in mazed disdain,<lb/>
I made Diego Valdez<lb/>
 High Admiral of Spain.</p>
            <p>Then walked no wind ’neath Heaven<lb/>
 Nor surge that did not aid —<lb/>
I dared extreme occasion,<lb/>
 Nor ever one betrayed.<lb/>
They wrought a deeper treason —<lb/>
 (Led seas that served my needs!)<lb/>
They sold Diego Valdez<lb/>
 To bondage of great deeds.</p>
            <p>The tempest flung me seaward,<lb/>
 And pinned and bade me hold<lb/>
The course I might not alter —<lb/>
 And men esteemed me bold!<lb/>
The calms embayed my quarry,<lb/>
 The fog-wreath sealed his eyes;<lb/>
The dawn-wind brought my topsails —<lb/>
 And men esteemed me wise!</p>
            <p>Yet, ’spite my tyrant triumphs,<lb/>
 Bewildered, dispossessed —<lb/>
My dream held I before me —<lb/>
 My vision of my rest;<lb/>
But, crowned by Fleet and People,<lb/>
 And bound by King and Pope<lb/>
Stands here Diego Valdez<lb/>
 To rob me of my hope.</p>
            <p>No prayer of mine shall move him,<lb/>
 No word of his set free<lb/>
The Lord of Sixty Pennants<lb/>
 And the Steward of the Sea.<lb/>
His will can loose ten thousand<lb/>
 To seek their loves again —<lb/>
But not Diego Valdez,<lb/>
 High Admiral of Spain.</p>
            <p>There walks no wind ’neath Heaven<lb/>
 Nor wave that shall restore<lb/>
The old careening riot<lb/>
 And the clamorous, crowded shore —<lb/>
The fountain in the desert,<lb/>
 The cistern in the waste,<lb/>
The bread we ate in secret,<lb/>
 The cup we spilled in haste.</p>
            <p>Now call I to my Captains —<lb/>
 For council fly the sign,<lb/>
Now leap their zealous galleys,<lb/>
 Twelve-oared, across the brine.<lb/>
To me the straiter prison,<lb/>
 To me the heavier chain —<lb/>
To me Diego Valdez,<lb/>
 High Admiral of Spain!</p>

The smell of goats and incense<lb/>

We feel there’s Something Waiting,<lb/>

            <byline>1898</byline>
            <p>YEARLY, with tent and rifle, our careless white men go<lb/>
By the pass called Muttianee, to shoot in the vale below.<lb/>
Yearly by Muttianee he follows our white men in —<lb/>
Matun, the old blind beggar, bandaged from brow to chin.</p>
            <p>Eyeless, noseless, and lipless — toothless, broken of speech,<lb/>
Seeking a dole at the doorway he mumbles his tale to each;<lb/>
Over and over the story, ending as he began:<lb/>
“Make ye no truce with Adam-zad — the Bear that walks like a Man!</p>
            <p>“There was a flint in my musket — pricked and primed was the pan,<lb/>
When I went hunting Adam-zad — the Bear that stands like a Man.<lb/>
I looked my last on the timber, I looked my last on the snow,<lb/>
When I went hunting Adam-zad fifty summers ago!</p>
            <p>“I knew his times and his seasons, as he knew mine, that fed<lb/>
By night in the ripened maizefield and robbed my house of bread.<lb/>
I knew his strength and cunning, as he knew mine, that crept<lb/>
At dawn to the crowded goat-pens and plundered while I slept.</p>
            <p>“Up from his stony playground — down from his well-digged lair —<lb/>
Out on the naked ridges ran Adam-zad the Bear;<lb/>
Groaning, grunting, and roaring, heavy with stolen meals,<lb/>
Two long marches to northward, and I was at his heels!</p>
            <p>“Two long marches to northward, at the fall of the second night,<lb/>
I came on mine enemy Adam-zad all panting from his flight.<lb/>
There was a charge in the musket — pricked and primed was the pan —<lb/>
My finger crooked on the trigger — when he reared up like a man.</p>
            <p>“Horrible, hairy, human, with paws like hands in prayer,<lb/>
Making his supplication rose Adam-zad the Bear!<lb/>
I looked at the swaying shoulders, at the paunch’s swag and swing,<lb/>
And my heart was touched with pity for the monstrous, pleading thing.</p>
            <p>“Touched with pity and wonder, I did not fire then . . .<lb/>
I have looked no more on women — I have walked no more with men.<lb/>
Nearer he tottered and nearer, with paws like hands that pray<lb/>
From brow to jaw that steel-shod paw, it ripped my face away!</p>
            <p>“Sudden, silent, and savage, searing as flame the blow —<lb/>
Faceless I fell before his feet, fifty summers ago.<lb/>
I heard him grunt and chuckle — I heard him pass to his den.<lb/>
He left me blind to the darkened years and the little mercy of men,</p>
            <p>“Now ye go down in the morning with guns of the newer style,<lb/>
That load (I have felt) in the middle and range (I have heard) a mile?<lb/>
Luck to the white man�s rifle, that shoots so fast and true,<lb/>
But — pay, and I lift my bandage and show what the Bear can do!”</p>
            <p>(Flesh like slag in the furnace, knobbed and withered and grey —<lb/>
Matun, the old blind beggar, he gives good worth for his pay.)<lb/>
“Rouse him at noon in the bushes, follow and press him hard —<lb/>
Not for his ragings and roarings flinch ye from Adam-zad.</p>
            <p>“But (pay, and I put back the bandage) <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the time to fear,<lb/>
When he stands up like a tired man, tottering near and near;<lb/>
When he stands up as pleading, in wavering, man-brute guise,<lb/>
When he veils the hate and cunning of his little, swinish eyes;</p>
            <p>“When he shows as seeking quarter, with paws like hands in prayer,<lb/>
                  <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is the time of peril — the time of the Truce of the Bear!”</p>
            <p>Eyeless, noseless, and lipless, asking a dole at the door,<lb/>
Matun, the old blind beggar, he tells it o’er and o’er;<lb/>
Fumbling and feeling the rifles, warming his hands at the flame,<lb/>
Hearing our careless white men talk of the morrow’s game;</p>
            <p>Over and over the story, ending as he began —<lb/>

            <byline>1898</byline>
            <p>“THERE’S no sense in going further — it’s the edge of cultivation,”<lb/>
 So they said, and I believed it — broke my land and sowed my crop —<lb/>
Built my barns and strung my fences in the little border station<lb/>
 Tucked away below the foothills where the trails run out and stop.</p>
            <p>Till a voice, as bad as Conscience, rang interminable change<lb/>
 On one everlasting Whisper day and night repeated — so<lb/>
“Something hidden. Go and find it. Go and look behin the Ranges —<lb/>
 “Something lost behind the Ranges. Lost and waiting fc you. Go!”</p>
            <p>So I went, worn out of patience; never told my nearest neighbours —<lb/>
 Stole away with pack and ponies-left ’em drinking in the town;<lb/>
And the faith that moveth mountains didn’t seem to help my labours<lb/>
 As I faced the sheer main-ranges, whipping up and leading down.</p>
            <p>March by march I puzzled through ’em, turning flanks and dodging shoulders,<lb/>
 Hurried on in hope of water, headed back for lack of grass;<lb/>
Till I camped above the tree-line-drifted snow and naked boulders —<lb/>
 Felt free air astir to windward — knew I’d stumbled on the Pass.</p>
            <p>’Thought to name it for the finder: but that night the Norther found me —<lb/>
 Froze and killed the plains-bred ponies; so I called the camp Despair<lb/>
(It’s the Railway Gap to-day, though). Then my Whisper waked to hound me:—<lb/>
 “Something lost behind the Ranges. Over yonder! Go you there!”</p>
            <p>Then I knew, the while I doubted — knew His Hand was certain o’er me.<lb/>
 Still — it might be self-delusion — scores of better men had died —<lb/>
I could reach the township living, but . . . He knows what terror tore me . . .<lb/>
 But I didn’t . . . but I didn’t. I went down the other side,</p>
            <p>Till the snow ran out in flowers, and the flowers turned to aloes,<lb/>
 And the aloes sprung to thickets and a brimming stream ran by;<lb/>
But the thickets dwined to thorn-scrub, and the water drained to shallows,<lb/>
 And I dropped again on desert — blasted earth, and blasting sky . . . .</p>
            <p>I remember lighting fires; I remember sitting by ’em;<lb/>
 I remember seeing faces, hearing voices, through the smoke;<lb/>
I remember they were fancy — for I threw a stone to try ’em.<lb/>
 “Something lost behind the Ranges” was the only word they spoke.</p>
            <p>I remember going crazy. I remember that I knew it<lb/>
 When I heard myself hallooing to the funny folk I saw.<lb/>
’Very full of dreams that desert, but my two legs took me through it . . .<lb/>
 And I used to watch ’em moving with the toes all black and raw.</p>
            <p>But at last the country altered — White Man’s country past disputing<lb/>
 Rolling grass and open timber, with a hint of hills behind —<lb/>
There I found me food and water, and I lay a week recruiting.<lb/>
 Got my strength and lost my nightmares. Then I entered on my find.</p>
            <p>Thence I ran my first rough survey — chose my trees and blazed and ringed ’em —<lb/>
 Week by week I pried and sampled — week by week my findings grew.<lb/>
Saul he went to look for donkeys, and by God he found a kingdom!<lb/>
 But by God, who sent His Whisper, I had struck the worth of two!</p>
            <p>Up along the hostile mountains, where the hair-poised snowslide shivers —<lb/>
 Down and through the big fat marshes that the virgin ore-bed stains,<lb/>
Till I heard the mile-wide mutterings of unimagined rivers,<lb/>
 And beyond the nameless timber saw illimitable plains!</p>
            <p>’Plotted sites of future cities, traced the easy grades between ’em;<lb/>
 Watched unharnessed rapids wasting fifty thousand head an hour;<lb/>
Counted leagues of water-frontage through the axe-ripe woods that screen ’em —<lb/>
 Saw the plant to feed a people — up and waiting for the power!</p>
            <p>Well I know who’ll take the credit — all the clever chaps that followed —<lb/>
 Came, a dozen men together — never knew my desert-fears;<lb/>
Tracked me by the camps I’d quitted, used the water-holes I’d hollowed.<lb/>
 They’ll go back and do the talking. <hi rend="italic">They’ll</hi> be called the Pioneers!</p>
            <p>They will find my sites of townships — not the cities that I set there.<lb/>
 They will rediscover rivers — not my rivers heard at night.<lb/>
By my own old marks and bearings they will show me how to get there,<lb/>
 By the lonely cairns I builded they will guide my feet aright.</p>
            <p>Have I named one single river? Have I claimed one single acre?<lb/>
 Have I kept one single nugget —(barring samples)? No, not I!<lb/>
Because my price was paid me ten times over by my Maker.<lb/>
 But you wouldn’t understand it. You go up and occupy.</p>
            <p>Ores you’ll find there; wood and cattle; water-transit sure and steady<lb/>
 (That should keep the railway rates down), coal and iron at your doors.<lb/>
God took care to hide that country till He judged His people ready,<lb/>
 Then He chose me for His Whisper, and I’ve found it, anti it’s yours!</p>
            <p>Yes, your “Never-never country”— yes, your “edge of cultivation “<lb/>
 And “no sense in going further”— till I crossed the range to see.<lb/>
God forgive me! No, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> didn’t. It’s God’s present to our nation.<lb/>
 Anybody might have found it but — His Whisper came to Me!</p>

            <head>The Palace</head>
            <byline>1902</byline>
            <p>WHEN I was King and a Mason — a Master proven and skilled —<lb/>
I cleared me ground for a Palace such as a King should build.<lb/>
I decreed and dug down to my levels. Presently, under the silt,<lb/>
I came on the wreck of a Palace such as a King had built.</p>
            <p>There was no worth in the fashion — there was no wit in the plan —<lb/>
Hither and thither, aimless, the ruined footings ran —<lb/>
Masonry, brute, mishandled, but careen on every stone:<lb/>
                  <hi rend="italic">“After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known.”</hi>
               </p>
            <p>Swift to my use in my trenches, where my well-planned ground-works grew,<lb/>
I tumbled his quoins and his ashlars, and cut and reset them anew.<lb/>
Lime I milled of his marbles; burned it, slacked it, and spread;<lb/>
Taking and leaving at pleasure the gifts of the humble dead.</p>
            <p>Yet I despised not nor gloried; yet, as we wrenched them apart,<lb/>
I read in the razed foundations the heart of that builder’s heart.<lb/>
As he had risen and pleaded, so did I understand<lb/>
The form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing he had planned.</p>
            <p>. . . . .</p>
            <p>When I was a King and a Mason — in the open noon of my pride,<lb/>
They sent me a Word from the Darkness — They whispered and called me aside.<lb/>
They said —“The end is forbidden.” They said —“Thy use is fulfilled.<lb/>
“Thy Palace shall stand as that other’s — the spoil of a King who shall build.”</p>
            <p>I called my men from my trenches, my quarries, my wharves, and my sheers.<lb/>
All I had wrought I abandoned to the faith of the faithless years.<lb/>
Only I cut on the timber — only I carved on the stone:<lb/>

Each to his choice, and I rejoice<lb/>
 The lot has fallen to me<lb/>
In a fair ground — in a fair ground —<lb/>
 Yea, Sussex by the sea!</p>
            <p>No tender-hearted garden crowns,<lb/>
 No bosomed woods adorn<lb/>
Our blunt, bow-headed, whale-backed Downs,<lb/>
 But gnarled and writhen thorn —<lb/>
Bare slopes where chasing shadows skim,<lb/>
 And, through the gaps revealed,<lb/>
Belt upon belt, the wooded, dim,<lb/>
 Blue goodness of the Weald.</p>
            <p>Clean of officious fence or hedge,<lb/>
 Half-wild and wholly tame,<lb/>
The wise turf cloaks the white cliff edge<lb/>
 As when the Romans came.<lb/>
What sign of those that fought and died<lb/>
 At shift of sword and sword?<lb/>
The barrow and the camp abide,<lb/>
 The sunlight and the sward.</p>
            <p>Here leaps ashore the full Sou’west<lb/>
 All heavy-winged with brine,<lb/>
Here lies above the folded crest<lb/>
 The Channel’s leaden line;<lb/>
And here the sea-fogs lap and cling,<lb/>
 And here, each warning each,<lb/>
The sheep-bells and the ship-bells ring<lb/>
 Along the hidden beach.</p>
            <p>We have no waters to delight<lb/>
 Our broad and brookless vales —<lb/>
Only the dewpond on the height<lb/>
 Unfed, that never fails —<lb/>
Whereby no tattered herbage tells<lb/>
 Which way the season flies —<lb/>
Only our close-bit thyme that smells<lb/>
 Like dawn in Paradise.</p>
            <p>Here through the strong and shadeless days<lb/>
 The tinkling silence thrills;<lb/>
Or little, lost, Down churches praise<lb/>
 The Lord who made the hills:<lb/>
But here the Old Gods guard their round,<lb/>
 And, in her secret heart,<lb/>
The heathen kingdom Wilfrid found<lb/>
 Dreams, as she dwells, apart.</p>
            <p>Though all the rest were all my share,<lb/>
 With equal soul I’d see<lb/>
Her nine-and-thirty sisters fair,<lb/>
 Yet none more fair than she.<lb/>
Choose ye your need from Thames to Tweed,<lb/>
 And I will choose instead<lb/>
Such lands as lie ’twixt Rake and Rye,<lb/>
 Black Down and Beachy Head.</p>
            <p>I will go out against the sun<lb/>
 Where the rolled scarp retires,<lb/>
And the Long Man of Wilmington<lb/>
 Looks naked toward the shires;<lb/>
And east till doubling Rother crawls<lb/>
 To find the fickle tide,<lb/>
By dry and sea-forgotten walls,<lb/>
 Our ports of stranded pride.</p>
            <p>I will go north about the shaws<lb/>
 And the deep ghylls that breed<lb/>
Huge oaks and old, the which we hold<lb/>
 No more than Sussex weed;<lb/>
Or south where windy Piddinghoe’s<lb/>
 Begilded dolphin veers<lb/>
And red beside wide-bankèd Ouse<lb/>
 Lie down our Sussex steers.</p>
            <p>So to the land our hearts we give<lb/>
 Till the sure magic strike,<lb/>
And Memory, Use, and Love make live<lb/>
 Us and our fields alike —<lb/>
That deeper than our speech and thought,<lb/>
 Beyond our reason’s sway,<lb/>
Clay of the pit whence we were wrought<lb/>
 Yearns to its fellow-clay.</p>

The savage wars of peace —<lb/>

The blame of those ye better,<lb/>
The hate of those ye guard —<lb/>
The cry of hosts ye humour<lb/>
(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:—<lb/>
“Why brought ye us from bondage,<lb/>
“Our loved Egyptian night?”</p>
            <p>Take up the White Man’s burden —<lb/>
Ye dare not stoop to less —<lb/>
Nor call too loud on Freedom<lb/>
To cloak your weariness;<lb/>
By all ye cry or whisper,<lb/>
By all ye leave or do,<lb/>
The silent, sullen peoples<lb/>
Shall weigh your Gods and you.</p>
            <p>Take up the White Man’s burden —<lb/>
Have done with childish days —<lb/>
The lightly proffered laurel,<lb/>
The easy, ungrudged praise.<lb/>
Comes now, to search your manhood<lb/>
Through all the thankless years,<lb/>
Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,<lb/>
The judgment of your peers!</p>

— EXTRACT FROM LETTER.</p>
            <p>SAID England unto Pharaoh, “I must make a man of you,<lb/>
 That will stand upon his feet and play the game;<lb/>
That will Maxim his oppressor as a Christian ought to do,”<lb/>
 And she sent old Pharaoh Sergeant Whatisname.<lb/>
  It was not a Duke nor Earl, nor yet a <hi rend="italic">Vis</hi>count —<lb/>
   It was not a big brass General that came;<lb/>
  But a man in khaki kit who could handle men a bit,<lb/>
   With his bedding labelled Sergeant Whatisname.</p>
            <p>Said England unto Pharaoh, “Though at present singing small,<lb/>
 You shall hum a proper tune before it ends,”<lb/>
And she introduced old Pharaoh to the Sergeant once for all,<lb/>
 And left ’em in the desert making friends,<lb/>
  It was not a Crystal Palace nor Cathedral;<lb/>
   It was not a public-house of common fame;<lb/>
  But a piece of red-hot sand, with a palm on either hand,<lb/>
   And a little hut for Sergeant Whatisname.</p>
            <p>Said England unto Pharaoh, “You’ve had miracles before,<lb/>
 When Aaron struck your rivers into blood;<lb/>
But if you watch the Sergeant he can show you something more.<lb/>
 He’s a charm for making riflemen from mud.”<lb/>
  It was neither Hindustani, French, nor Coptics;<lb/>
   It was odds and ends and leavings of the same,<lb/>
  Translated by a stick (which is really half the trick),<lb/>
   And Pharaoh harked to Sergeant Whatisname.</p>
            <p>(There were years that no one talked of; there were times of horrid doubt —<lb/>
 There was faith and hope and whacking and despair —<lb/>
While the Sergeant gave the Cautions and he combed old Pharaoh out,<lb/>
 And England didn’t seem to know nor care.<lb/>
  That is England’s awful way o’ doing business —<lb/>
   She would serve her God (or Gordon) just the same —<lb/>
  For she thinks her Empire still is the Strand and Holborn Hill,<lb/>
   And she didn’t think of Sergeant Whatisname.)</p>
            <p>Said England to the Sergeant, “You can let my people go!”<lb/>
 (England used ’em cheap and nasty from the start),<lb/>
And they entered ’em in battle on a most astonished foe —<lb/>
 But the Sergeant he had hardened Pharaoh’s heart<lb/>
  Which was broke, along of all the plagues of Egypt,<lb/>
   Three thousand years before the Sergeant came —<lb/>
  And he mended it again in a little more than ten,<lb/>
   Till Pharaoh fought like Sergeant Whatisname.</p>
            <p>It was wicked bad campaigning (cheap and nasty from the first),<lb/>
 There was heat and dust and coolie-work and sun,<lb/>
There were vipers, flies, and sandstorms, there was cholera and thirst,<lb/>
 But Pharaoh done the best he ever done.<lb/>
  Down the desert, down the railway, down the river,<lb/>
   Like Israelites from bondage so he came,<lb/>
  ’Tween the clouds o’ dust and fire to the land of his desire,<lb/>
   And his Moses, it was Sergeant Whatisname!</p>
            <p>We are eating dirt in handfuls for to save our daily bread,<lb/>
 Which we have to buy from those that hate us most,<lb/>
And we must not raise the money where the Sergeant raised the dead,<lb/>
 And it’s wrong and bad and dangerous to boast.<lb/>
But he did it on the cheap and on the quiet,<lb/>
 And he’s not allowed to forward any claim —<lb/>
  Though he drilled a black man white, though he made a mummy fight,<lb/>
   He will still continue Sergeant Whatisname<lb/>
  Private, Corporal, Colour-Sergeant, and Instructor<lb/>
   But the everlasting miracle’s the same!</p>

            <p>IN EXTENDED observation of the ways and works of man,<lb/>
From the Four-mile Radius roughly to the Plains of Hindustan:<lb/>
I have drunk with mixed assemblies, seen the racial ruction rise,<lb/>
And the men of half Creation damning half Creation’s eyes.</p>
            <p>I have watched them in their tantrums, all that pentecostal crew,<lb/>
French, Italian, Arab, Spaniard, Dutch and Greek, and Russ and Jew,<lb/>
Celt and savage, buff and ochre, cream and yellow, mauve and white;<lb/>
But it never really mattered till the English grew polite;</p>
            <p>Till the men with polished toppers, till the men in long frockcoats,<lb/>
Till the men who do not duel, till the men who war with votes,<lb/>
Till the breed that take their pleasures as Saint Lawrence took his grid,<lb/>
Began to “beg your pardon” and — the knowing croupier hid.</p>
            <p>Then the bandsmen with their fiddles, and the girls that bring the beer,<lb/>
Felt the psychologic moment, left the lit casino clear;<lb/>
But the uninstructed alien, from the Teuton to the Gaul,<lb/>
Was entrapped, once more, my country, by that suave, deceptive drawl.</p>
            <p>. . . . .</p>
            <p>As it was in ancient Suez or ‘neath wilder, milder skies,<lb/>
I “observe with apprehension” when the racial ructions rise;<lb/>
And with keener apprehension, if I read the times aright,<lb/>
Hear the old casino order: “Watch your man, but be polite.</p>
            <p>“Keep your temper. Never answer (<hi rend="italic">that</hi> was why they spat and swore).<lb/>
Don’t hit first, but move together (there’s no hurry) to the door.<lb/>
Back to back, and facing outward while the linguist tells ’em how —<lb/>
“<hi rend="italic">Nous sommes allong ar notre batteau, nous ne voulong pas un row.</hi>”’</p>
            <p>So the hard, pent rage ate inward, till some idiot went too far . . .<lb/>
“Let’em have it!” and they had it, and the same was merry war.<lb/>
Fist, umbrella, cane, decanter, lamp and beer-mug, chair and boot —<lb/>
Till behind the fleeing legions rose the long, hoarse yell for loot.</p>
            <p>Then the oil-cloth with its numbers, like a banner fluttered free;<lb/>
Then the grand piano cantered, on three castors, down the quay;<lb/>
White, and breathing through their nostrils, silent, systematic, swift —<lb/>
They removed, effaced, abolished all that man could heave or lift.</p>
            <p>Oh, my country, bless the training that from cot to castle runs —<lb/>
The pitfall of the stranger but the bulwark of thy sons —<lb/>
Measured speech and ordered action, sluggish soul and unperturbed,<lb/>
Till we wake our Island-Devil — nowise cool for being curbed!</p>
            <p>When the heir of all the ages “has the honour to remain,”<lb/>
When he will not hear an insult, though men make it ne’er so plain,<lb/>
When his lips are schooled to meekness. when his back is bowed to blows<lb/>
Well the keen <hi rend="italic">aas-vogels</hi> know it — well the waiting jackal knows.</p>
            <p>Build on the flanks of Etna where the sullen smoke-puffs float —<lb/>
Or bathe in tropic waters where the lean fin dogs the boat —<lb/>
Cock the gun that is not loaded, cook the frozen dynamite —<lb/>
But oh, beware my Country, when my Country grows polite!</p>

            <byline>1898</byline>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Being a translation of the song that was made by a Mohammedan school master of Bengal Infantry (some time on service
at Suakim) when he heard that Kitchener was taking money from the English to build a Madrissa for Hubshees — or a college
for the Sudanese</hi>.</p>
            <p>OH HUBSHEE, carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast!<lb/>
This is the message of Kitchener who did not break you in jest.<lb/>
It was permitted to him to fulfil the long-appointed years;<lb/>
Reaching the end ordained of old over your dead Emirs.</p>
            <p>He stamped only before your walls, and the Tomb ye knew was dust:<lb/>
He gathered up under his armpits all the swords of your trust:<lb/>
He set a guard on your granaries, securing the weak from the strong:<lb/>
He said:—“Go work the waterwheels that were abolished so long.”</p>
            <p>He said:—“Go safely, being abased. I have accomplished my vow.<lb/>
That was the mercy of Kitchener. Cometh his madness now!<lb/>
He does not desire as ye desire, nor devise as ye devise:<lb/>
He is preparing a second host — an army to make you wise.</p>
            <p>Not at the mouth of his clean-lipped guns shall ye learn his name again,<lb/>
But letter by letter, from Kaf to Kaf, at the mouths of his chosen men.<lb/>
He has gone back to his own city, not seeking presents or bribes,<lb/>
But openly asking the English for money to buy you Hakims and scribes.</p>
            <p>Knowing that ye are forfeit by battle and have no right to live,<lb/>
He begs for money to bring you learning — and all the English give.<lb/>
It is their treasure — it is their pleasure — thus are their hearts inclined:<lb/>
For Allah created the English mad — the maddest of all mankind!</p>
            <p>They do not consider the Meaning of Things; they consult not creed nor clan.<lb/>
Behold, they clap the slave on the back, and behold, he ariseth a man!<lb/>
They terribly carpet the earth with dead, and before their cannon cool,<lb/>
They walk unarmed by twos and threes to call the living to school.</p>
            <p>How is this reason (which is their reason) to judge a scholar’s worth,<lb/>
By casting a ball at three straight sticks and defending the same with a fourth?<lb/>
But this they do (which is doubtless a spell) and other matters more strange,<lb/>
Until, by the operation of years, the hearts of their scholars change:</p>
            <p>Till these make come and go great boats or engines upon the rail<lb/>
(But always the English watch near by to prop them when they fail);<lb/>
Till these make laws of their own choice and Judges of their own blood;<lb/>
And all the mad English obey the judges and say that that Law is good.</p>
            <p>Certainly they were mad from of old; but I think one new thing,<lb/>
That the magic whereby they work their magic — wherefrom their fortunes spring —<lb/>
May be that they show all peoples their magic and ask no price in return.<lb/>
Wherefore, since ye are bond to that magic, O Hubshee, make haste and learn!</p>
            <p>Certainly also is Kitchener mad. But one sure thing I know —<lb/>
If he who broke you be minded to teach you, to his Madrissa go!<lb/>
Go, and carry your shoes in your hand and bow your head on your breast,<lb/>
For he who did not slay you in sport, he will not teach you in jest.</p>

Bright-eyed out of the battle, the Young Queen rode to be crowned.</p>
            <p>She came to the Old Queen’s presence, in the Hall of Our Thousand Years —<lb/>
In the Hall of the Five Free Nations that are peers among their peers:<lb/>
Royal she gave the greeting, loyal she bowed the head,<lb/>
Crying —“Crown me, my Mother!” And the Old Queen rose and said:—</p>
            <p>“How can I crown thee further? I know whose standard flies<lb/>
Where the clean surge takes the Leeuwin or the coral barriers rise.<lb/>
Blood of our foes on thy bridle, and speech of our friends in thy mouth —<lb/>
How can I crown thee further, O Queen of the Sovereign South?</p>
            <p>“Let the Five Free Nations witness!” But the Young Queen answered swift:—<lb/>
“It shall be crown of Our crowning to hold Our crown for a gift.<lb/>
In. the days when Our folk were feeble thy sword made sure Our lands:<lb/>
Wherefore We come in power to take Our crown at thy hands.”</p>
            <p>And the Old Queen raised and kissed her, and the jealous circlet prest,<lb/>
Roped with the pearls of the Northland and red with the gold of the West,<lb/>
Lit with her land’s own opals, levin-hearted, alive,<lb/>
And the Five-starred Cross above them, for sign of the Nations Five.</p>
            <p>So it was done in the Presence — in the Hall of Our Thousand Years,<lb/>
In the face of the Five Free Nations that have no peer but their peers;<lb/>
And the Young Queen out of the Southland kneeled down at the Old Queen’s knee,<lb/>
And asked for a mother’s blessing on the excellent years to be.</p>
            <p>And the Old Queen stooped in the stillness where the jewelled head drooped low:—<lb/>
“Daughter no more but Sister, and doubly Daughter so —<lb/>
Mother of many princes — and child of the child I bore,<lb/>
What good thing shall I wish thee that I have not wished before?</p>
            <p>“Shall I give thee delight in dominion — mere pride of thy setting forth?<lb/>
Nay, we be women together — we know what that lust is worth.<lb/>
Peace in thy utmost borders, and strength on a road untrod?<lb/>
These are dealt or diminished at the secret will of God.</p>
            <p>“I have swayed troublous councils, I am wise in terrible things;<lb/>
Father and son and grandson, I have known the hearts of the Kings.<lb/>
Shall I give thee my sleepless wisdom, or the gift all wisdom above?<lb/>
Ay, we be women together — I give thee thy people’s love:</p>
            <p>“Tempered, august, abiding, reluctant of prayers or vows,<lb/>
Eager in face of peril as thine for thy mother’s house.<lb/>
God requite thee, my Sister, through the excellent years to be,<lb/>
And make thy people to love thee as thou hast loved me!”</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">LET us admit it fairly, as a business people should,<lb/>
We have had no end of a lesson: it will do us no end of good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not on a single issue, or in one direction or twain,<lb/>
But conclusively, comprehensively, and several times and again,<lb/>
Were all our most holy illusions knocked higher than Gilderoy’s kite.<lb/>
We have had a jolly good lesson, and it serves us jolly well right!</p>
            <p>This was not bestowed us under the trees, nor yet in the shade of a tent,<lb/>
But swingingly, over eleven degrees of a bare brown continent.<lb/>
From Lamberts to Delagoa Bay, and from Pietersburg to Sutherland,<lb/>
Fell the phenomenal lesson we learned — with a fulness accorded no other land.</p>
            <p>It was our fault, and our very great fault, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the judgment of Heaven.<lb/>
We made an Army in our own image, on an island nine by seven,<lb/>
Which faithfully mirrored its makers’ ideals, equipment, and mental attitude —<lb/>
And so we got our lesson: and we ought to accept it with gratitude.</p>
            <p>We have spent two hundred million pounds to prove the fact once more,<lb/>
That horses are quicker than men afoot, since two and two make four;<lb/>
And horses have four legs, and men have two legs, and two into four goes twice,<lb/>
And nothing over except our lesson-and very cheap at the price.</p>
            <p>For remember (this our children shall know: we are too near for that knowledge)<lb/>
Not our mere astonied camps, but Council and Creed and College —<lb/>
All the obese, unchallenged old things that stifle and overlie us —<lb/>
Have felt the effects of the lesson we got — an advantage no money could buy us!</p>
            <p>Then let us develop this marvellous asset which we alone command,<lb/>
And which, it may subsequently transpire, will be worth as much as the Rand.<lb/>
Let us approach this pivotal fact in a humble yet hopeful mood —<lb/>
We have had no end of a lesson, it will do us no end of good!</p>
            <p>It was our fault, and our very great fault — and now we must turn it to use.<lb/>
We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse.<lb/>
So the more we work and the less we talk the better results we shall get —<lb/>
We have had an Imperial lesson; it may make us an Empire yet!</p>

            <p>FILES—<lb/>
The Files —<lb/>
Office Files!<lb/>
Oblige me by referring to the Files.<lb/>
Every question man can raise,<lb/>
Every phrase of every phase<lb/>
Of that question is on record in the Files<lb/>
(Threshed out threadbarefought and finished in the Files).<lb/>
Ere the Universe at large<lb/>
Was our new-tipped arrows’ targe —<lb/>
Ere we rediscovered Mammon and his wiles —<lb/>
Faenza, gentle reader, spent her — five-and-twentieth leader —<lb/>
(You will find him, and some others, in the Files).<lb/>
Warn all coming Robert Brownings and Carlyles,<lb/>
It will interest them to hunt among the Files,<lb/>
Where unvisited, a-cold,<lb/>
Lie the crowded years of old<lb/>
In that Kensall-Green of greatness called the Files<lb/>
(In our newspaPère-la-Chaise the Office Files),<lb/>
Where the dead men lay them down<lb/>
Meekiy sure of long renown,<lb/>
And above them, sere and swift,<lb/>
Packs the daily deepening drift<lb/>
Of the all-recording, alleffacing Files —<lb/>
The obliterating, automatic Files.<lb/>
Count the mighty men who slung<lb/>
Ink, Evangel, Sword, or Tongue<lb/>
When Reform and you were young —<lb/>
Made their boasts and spake according in the Files —<lb/>
(Hear the ghosts that wake applauding in the Files!)<lb/>
Trace each all-forgot career<lb/>
From long primer through brevier<lb/>
Unto Death, a para minion in the Files<lb/>
(Para minion — solid — bottom of the Files) . . . .<lb/>
Some successful Kings and Queens adorn the Files.<lb/>
They were great, their views were leaded,<lb/>
And their deaths were tripleheaded,<lb/>
So they catch the eye in running through the Files<lb/>
(Show as blazes in the mazes of the Files);<lb/>
For their “paramours and priests,”<lb/>
And their gross, jack-booted feasts,<lb/>
And their “epoch-marking actions” see the Files.<lb/>
Was it Bomba fled the blue Sicilian isles?<lb/>
Was it Saffi, a professor<lb/>
Once of Oxford, brought redress or<lb/>
Garibaldi? Who remembers<lb/>
Forty-odd-year-old Septembers?—<lb/>
Only sextons paid to dig among the Files<lb/>
(Such as I am, born and bred among the Files).<lb/>
You must hack through much deposit<lb/>
Ere you know for sure who was it<lb/>
Came to burial with such honour in the Files<lb/>
(Only seven seasons back beneath the Files).<lb/>
“Very great our loss and grievous”<lb/>
So our best and brightest leave us,<lb/>
“And it ends the Age of Giants,” say the Files;<lb/>
All the ’60 —’70 —’80 —’90 Files<lb/>
(The open-minded, opportunist Files —<lb/>
The easy “O King, live for ever” Files).<lb/>
It is good to read a little in the Files;<lb/>
’Tis a sure and sovereign balm<lb/>
Unto philosophic calm,<lb/>
Yea, and philosophic doubt when Life beguiles.<lb/>
When you know Success is Greatness,<lb/>
When you marvel at your lateness<lb/>
In apprehending facts so plain to Smiles<lb/>
(Selfhelpful, wholly strenuous Samuel Smiles).<lb/>
When your Imp of Blind Desire<lb/>
Bids you set the Thames afire,<lb/>
You’ll remember men have done so — in the Files.<lb/>
You’ll have seen those flames transpire — in the Files<lb/>
(More than once that flood has run so — in the Files).<lb/>
When the Conchimarian horns<lb/>
Of the reboantic Norns<lb/>
Usher gentlemen and ladies<lb/>
With new lights on Heaven and Hades,<lb/>
Guaranteeing to Eternity<lb/>
All yesterday’s modernity;<lb/>
When Brocken-spectres made by<lb/>
Some one’s breath on ink parade by,<lb/>
Very earnest and tremendous,<lb/>
Let not shows of shows offend us.<lb/>
When of everything we like we<lb/>
Shout ecstatic: “<hi rend="italic">Quod ubique</hi>,<lb/>
“<hi rend="italic">Quod ab omnibus</hi> means <hi rend="italic">semper</hi>!”<lb/>
Oh, my brother, keep your temper!<lb/>
Light your pipe and take a look along the Files.<lb/>
You’ve a better chance to guess<lb/>
At the meaning of Success<lb/>
(Which is Greatness — <hi rend="italic">vide</hi> press)<lb/>
When you’ve seen it in perspective in the Files.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">NO DOUBT but ye are the People — your throne is above the King’s.<lb/>
Whoso speaks in your presence must say acceptable things:<lb/>
Bowing the head in worship, bending the knee in fear —<lb/>
Bringing the word well smoothen — such as a King should hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fenced by your careful fathers, ringed by your leaden seas,<lb/>
Long did ye wake in quiet and long lie down at ease;<lb/>
Till ye said of Strife, “What is it?” of the Sword, “It is far from our ken”:<lb/>
Till ye made a sport of your shrunken hosts and a toy of your armed men.<lb/>
Ye stopped your ears to the warning — ye would neither look nor heed —<lb/>
Ye set your leisure before their toil and your lusts above their need.<lb/>
Because of your witless learning and your beasts of warren and chase,<lb/>
Ye grudged your sons to their service and your fields for their camping-place.<lb/>
Ye forced them to glean in the highways the straw for the bricks they brought;<lb/>
Ye forced them follow in byways the craft that ye never taught.<lb/>
Ye hindered and hampered and crippled; ye thrust out of sight and away<lb/>
Those that would serve you for honour and those that served you for pay.<lb/>
Then were the judgments loosened; then was your shame revealed,<lb/>
At the hands of a little people, few but apt in the field.<lb/>
Yet ye were saved by a remnant (and your land’s long-suffering star),<lb/>
When your strong men cheered in their millions while your striplings went to the war.<lb/>
Sons of the sheltered city — unmade, unhandled, unmeet —<lb/>
Ye pushed them raw to the battle as ye picked them raw from the street.<lb/>
And what did ye look they should compass? Warcraft learned in a breath,<lb/>
Knowledge unto occasion at the first far view of Death?<lb/>
So? And ye train your horses and the dogs ye feed and prize?<lb/>
How are the beasts more worthy than the souls, your sacrifice?<lb/>
But ye said, “Their valour shall show them”; but ye said, “The end is close.”<lb/>
And ye sent them comfits and pictures to help them harry your foes:<lb/>
And ye vaunted your fathomless power, and ye flaunted your iron pride,<lb/>
Ere — ye fawned on the Younger Nations for the men who could shoot and ride!<lb/>
Then ye returned to your trinkets; then ye contented your souls<lb/>
With the flannelled fools at the wicket or the muddied oafs at the goals.<lb/>
Given to strong delusion, wholly believing a lie,<lb/>
Ye saw that the land lay fenceless, and ye let the months go by<lb/>
Waiting some easy wonder, hoping some saving sign<lb/>
Idle — openly idle — in the lee of the forespent Line.<lb/>
Idle — except for your boasting — and what is your boasting worth<lb/>
If ye grudge a year of service to the lordliest life on earth?<lb/>
Ancient, effortless, ordered, cycle on cycle set,<lb/>
Life so long untroubled, that ye who inherit forget<lb/>
It was not made with the mountains, it is not one with the deep.<lb/>
Men, not gods, devised it. Men, not gods, must keep.<lb/>
Men, not children, servants, or kinsfolk called from afar,<lb/>
But each man born in the Island broke to the matter of war.<lb/>
Soberly and by custom taken and trained for the same,<lb/>
Each man born in the Island entered at youth to the game —<lb/>
As it were almost cricket, not to be mastered in haste,<lb/>
But after trial and labour, by temperance, living chaste.<lb/>
As it were almost cricket — as it were even your play,<lb/>
Weighed and pondered and worshipped, and practised day and day.<lb/>
So ye shall bide sure-guarded when the restless lightnings wake<lb/>
In the womb of the blotting war-cloud, and the pallid nations quake.<lb/>
So, at the haggard trumpets, instant your soul shall leap<lb/>
Forthright, accoutred, accepting — alert from the wells of sleep.<lb/>
So at the threat ye shall summon — so at the need ye shall send<lb/>
Men, not children or servants, tempered and taught to the end;<lb/>
Cleansed of servile panic, slow to dread or despise,<lb/>
Humble because of knowledge, mighty by sacrifice.<lb/>
But ye say, “It will mar our comfort.” Ye say, “It will minish our trade.”<lb/>
Do ye wait for the spattered shrapnel ere ye learn how a gun is laid?<lb/>
For the low, red glare to southward when the raided coast-towns burn?<lb/>
(Light ye shall have on that lesson, but little time to learn.)<lb/>
Will ye pitch some white pavilion, and lustily even the odds,<lb/>
With nets and hoops and mallets, with rackets and bats and rods?<lb/>
Will the rabbit war with your foemen — the red deer horn them for hire?<lb/>
Your kept cock — pheasant keep you?— he is master of many a shire.<lb/>
Arid, aloof, incurious, unthinking, unthanking, gelt,<lb/>
Will ye loose your schools to flout them till their brow-beat columns melt?<lb/>
Will ye pray them or preach them, or print them, or ballot them back from your shore?<lb/>
Will your workmen issue a mandate to bid them strike no more?<lb/>
Will ye rise and dethrone your rulers? (Because ye were idle both?<lb/>
Pride by Insolence chastened? Indolence purged by Sloth?)<lb/>
No doubt but ye are the People; who shall make you afraid?<lb/>
Also your gods are many; no doubt but your gods shall aid.<lb/>
Idols of greasy altars built for the body’s ease;<lb/>
Proud little brazen Baals and talking fetishes;<lb/>
Teraphs of sept and party and wise wood-pavement gods —<lb/>
                  <hi rend="italic">These</hi> shall come down to the battle and snatch you from under the rods?<lb/>
From the gusty, flickering gun-roll with viewless salvoes rent,<lb/>
And the pitted hail of the bullets that tell not whence they were sent.<lb/>
When ye are ringed as with iron, when ye are scourged as with whips,<lb/>
When the meat is yet in your belly, and the boast is yet on your lips;<lb/>
When ye go forth at morning and the noon beholds you broke,<lb/>
Ere ye lie down at even, your remnant, under the yoke?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">No doubt but ye are the People — absolute, strong, and wise;<lb/>
Whatever your heart has desired ye have not withheld from your eyes.<lb/>

            <head>The Peace of Dives</head>
            <byline>1903</byline>
            <p>THE WORD came down to Dives in Torment where he lay:<lb/>
“Our World is full of wickedness, My Children maim and slay,<lb/>
 “And the Saint and Seer and Prophet<lb/>
 “Can make no better of it<lb/>
“Than to sanctify and prophesy and pray.</p>
            <p>“Rise up, rise up, thou Dives, and take again thy gold,<lb/>
“And thy women and thy housen as they were to thee of old.<lb/>
 “It may be grace hath found thee<lb/>
 “In the furnace where We bound thee,<lb/>
“And that thou shalt bring the peace My Son foretold.”</p>
            <p>Then merrily rose Dives and leaped from out his fire,<lb/>
And walked abroad with diligence to do the Lord’s desire;<lb/>
 And anon the battles ceased,<lb/>
 And the captives were released,<lb/>
And Earth had rest from Goshen to Gadire,</p>
            <p>The Word came down to Satan that raged and roared alone,’<lb/>
’Mid the shouting of the peoples by the cannon overthrown<lb/>
 (But the Prophets, Saints, and Seers<lb/>
 Set each other by the ears,<lb/>
For each would claim the marvel as his own):</p>
            <p>“Rise up, rise up, thou Satan, upon the Earth to go,<lb/>
“And prove the Peace of Dives if it be good or no:<lb/>
 “For all that he hath planned<lb/>
 “We deliver to thy hand,<lb/>
“As thy skill shall serve, to break it or bring low.”</p>
            <p>Then mightily rose Satan, and about the Earth he hied,<lb/>
And breathed on Kings in idleness and Princes drunk with pride.<lb/>
 But for all the wrong he breathed<lb/>
 There was never sword unsheathed,<lb/>
And the fires he lighted flickered out and died.</p>
            <p>Then terribly rose Satan, and he darkened Earth afar,<lb/>
Till he came on cunning Dives where the money-changers are;<lb/>
 And he saw men pledge their gear<lb/>
 For the gold that buys the spear,<lb/>
And the helmet and the habergeon of war.</p>
            <p>Yea to Dives came the Persian and the Syrian and the Mede —<lb/>
their hearts were nothing altered, nor their cunning nor their greed —<lb/>
 And they pledged their flocks and farms<lb/>
 For the King compelling arms,<lb/>
And Dives lent according to their need,</p>
            <p>Then Satan said to Dives:—”Return again with me,<lb/>
“Who hast broken His Commandment in the day He set thee free,<lb/>
 “Who grindest for thy greed,<lb/>
 “Man’s belly-pinch and need;<lb/>
“And the blood of Man to filthy usury!”</p>
            <p>Then softly answered Dives where the money-changers sit:—<lb/>
“My refuge is Our Master, O My Master in the Pit.<lb/>
 “But behold all Earth is laid<lb/>
 “In the Peace which I have made,<lb/>
“And behold I wait on thee to trouble it!”</p>
            <p>Then angrily turned Satan, and about the Seas he fled,<lb/>
To shake the new-sown peoples with insult, doubt, and dread;<lb/>
 But, for all the sleight he used,<lb/>
 There was never squadron loosed.<lb/>
And the brands he flung flew dying and fell dead.</p>
            <p>But to Dives came Atlantis and the Captains of the West —<lb/>
And their hates were nothing weakened nor their anger nor unrest —<lb/>
 And they pawned their utmost trade<lb/>
 For the dry, decreeing blade;<lb/>
And Dives lent and took of them their best.</p>
            <p>Then Satan said to Dives:—“Declare thou by The Name,<lb/>
“The secret of thy subtlety that turneth mine to shame.<lb/>
 “It is known through all the Hells<lb/>
 “How my peoples mocked my spells,<lb/>
“And my faithless Kings denied me ere I came.”</p>
            <p>Then answered cunning Dives: “Do not gold and hate abide<lb/>
“At the heart of every Magic, yea, and senseless fear beside?<lb/>
 “With gold and fear and hate<lb/>
 “I have harnessed state to state,<lb/>
“And by hate and fear and gold their hates are tied.</p>
            <p>“For hate men seek a weapon, for fear they seek a shield —<lb/>
“ Keener blades and broader targes than their frantic neighhours wield —<lb/>
 “For gold I arm their hands,<lb/>
 “And for gold I buy their lands,<lb/>
“And for gold I sell their enemies the yield.</p>
            <p>“Their nearest foes may purchase, or their furthest friends may lease,<lb/>
“One by one from Ancient Accad to the Islands of the Seas.<lb/>
 “And their covenants they make<lb/>
 “For the naked iron’s sake,<lb/>
“But I— I trap them armoured into peace.</p>
            <p>“The flocks that Egypt pledged me to Assyria I drave,<lb/>
“And Pharaoh hath the increase of the herds that Sargon gave.<lb/>
 “Not for Ashdod overthrown<lb/>
 “Will the Kings destroy their own,<lb/>
“Or their peoples wake the strife they feign to brave.</p>
            <p>“Is not Carchernish like Calno? For the steeds of their desire<lb/>
“They have sold me seven harvests that I sell to Crowning Tyre;<lb/>
 “And the Tyrian sweeps the plains<lb/>
 “With a thousand hired wains,<lb/>
“And the Cities keep the peace and — share the hire.</p>
            <p>“Hast thou seen the pride of Moab? For the swords about his path,<lb/>
“His bond is to Philistia, in half of all he hath.<lb/>
 “And he dare not draw the sword<lb/>
 “Till Gaza give the word,<lb/>
“And he show release from Askalon and Gath,</p>
            <p>“Wilt thou call again thy peoples, wilt thou craze anew thy Kings?<lb/>
“Lo! my lightnings pass before thee, and their whistling servant brings,<lb/>
 “Ere the drowsy street hath stirred —<lb/>
 “Every masked and midnight word,<lb/>
“And the nations break their fast upon these things.</p>
            <p>“So I make a jest of Wonder, and a mock of Time and Space.<lb/>
“The roofless Seas an hostel, and the Earth a market-place,<lb/>
 “Where the anxious traders know<lb/>
 “Each is surety for his foe,<lb/>
“And none may thrive without his fellows’ grace.</p>
            <p>“Now this is all my subtlety and this is all my wit,<lb/>
“God give thee good enlightenment, My Master in the Pit.<lb/>
 “But behold all Earth is laid<lb/>
 “In the Peace which I have made,<lb/>
“And behold I wait on thee to trouble it!”</p>

 Africa all over !</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Half her land was dead with drouth,<lb/>
 Half was red with battle;<lb/>
She was fenced with fire and sword<lb/>
Plague on pestilence outpoured,<lb/>
Locusts on the greening sward<lb/>
 And murrain on the cattle!</p>
            <p>

            <p>Bitter hard her lovers toiled,<lb/>
 Scandalous their payment,<lb/>
Food forgot on trains derailed;<lb/>
Cattle-dung where fuel failed;<lb/>
Water where the mules had staled;<lb/>
 And sackcloth for their raiment!</p>
            <p>So she filled their mouths with dust<lb/>
 And their bones with fever;<lb/>
Greeted them with cruel lies;<lb/>
Treated them despiteful-wise;<lb/>
Meted them calamities<lb/>
 Till they vowed to leave her!</p>
            <p>They took ship and they took sail,<lb/>
 Raging, from her borders<lb/>
In a little, none the less,<lb/>
They forgat their sore duresse,<lb/>
They forgave her waywardness<lb/>
 And returned for orders!</p>
            <p>They esteemed her favour more<lb/>
 Than a Throne’s foundation.<lb/>
For the glory of her face<lb/>
Bade farewell to breed and race<lb/>
Yea, and made their burial-place<lb/>
 Altar of a Nation!</p>
            <p>Wherefore, being bought by blood,<lb/>

We will gather and lead to her lips again<lb/>
 The waters of ancient strife,<lb/>
From the far and fiercely guarded streams<lb/>

Till the corn cover our evil dreams<lb/>
 And the young corn our hate.</p>
            <p>And when we bring old fights to mind,<lb/>
 We will not remember the sin —<lb/>
If there be blood on his head of my kind,<lb/>

For the ungrazed upland, the untilled lea<lb/>
 Crk, and the fields forlorn:<lb/>
“The dead must bury their dead, but ye —<lb/>
 Ye serve an host unborn.”</p>
            <p>Bless then, Our God, the new-yoked plough<lb/>

And the bread we eat in the sweat of our brow<lb/>
 According to Thy Law.<lb/>
After us cometh a multitude —<lb/>

That we may feed with our land’s food<lb/>
 The folk of all our lands!</p>
            <p>Here, in the waves and the troughs of the plains,<lb/>

And the vast, benignant sky restrains<lb/>
 And the long days make wise —<lb/>
