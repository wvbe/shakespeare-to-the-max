            <head>Imitation of Spenser</head>
            <l>Now Morning from her orient chamber came,</l>
            <l>And her first footsteps touch'd a verdant hill;</l>
            <l>Crowning its lawny crest with amber flame,</l>
            <l>Silv'ring the untainted gushes of its rill;</l>
            <l>Which, pure from mossy beds, did down distill,</l>
            <l>And after parting beds of simple flowers,</l>
            <l>By many streams a little lake did fill,</l>
            <l>Which round its marge reflected woven bowers,</l>
            <l>And, in its middle space, a sky that never lowers.</l>
            <l>There the king-fisher saw his plumage bright</l>
            <l>Vieing with fish of brilliant dye below;</l>
            <l>Whose silken fins, and golden scales light</l>
            <l>Cast upward, through the waves, a ruby glow</l>
            <l>There saw the swan his neck of arched snow,</l>
            <l>And oar'd himself along with majesty;</l>
            <l>Sparkled his jetty eyes; his feet did show</l>
            <l>Beneath the waves like Afric's ebony,</l>
            <l>And on his back a fay reclined voluptuously.</l>
            <l>Ah!  could I tell the wonders of an isle</l>
            <l>That in that fairest lake had placed been,</l>
            <l>I could e'en Dido of her grief beguile;</l>
            <l>Or rob from aged Lear his bitter teen</l>
            <l>For sure so fair a place was never seen,</l>
            <l>Of all that ever charm'd romantic eye</l>
            <l>It seem'd an emerald in the silver sheen</l>
            <l>Of the bright waters; or as when on high,</l>
            <l>Through clouds of fleecy white, laughs the coerulean sky.</l>
            <l>And all around it dipp'd luxuriously</l>
            <l>Slopings of verdure through the glassy tide,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="28"/>
            <l>Which, as it were in gentle amity,</l>
            <l>Rippled delighted up the flowery side;</l>
            <l>As if to glean the ruddy tears, it tried,</l>
            <l>Which fell profusely from the rose-tree stem!</l>
            <l>Haply it was the workings of its pride,</l>
            <l>In strife to throw upon the shore a gem</l>
            <l>Outvieing all the buds in Flora's diadem.</l>

            <l>The dwellings of this war-surrounded isle;</l>
            <l>Soothing with placid brow our late distress,</l>
            <l>Making the triple kingdom brightly smile?</l>

            <l>Complete my joy — let not my first wish fail,</l>
            <l>Let the sweet mountain nymph thy favourite be,</l>
            <l>With England's happiness proclaim Europa's liberty.</l>
            <l>O Europe!  let not sceptred tyrants see</l>
            <l>That thou must shelter in thy former state;</l>
            <l>Keep thy chains burst, and boldly say thou art free;</l>
            <l>Give thy kings law — leave not uncurbed the great;</l>

            <l>Nought comforts then the leafless grove</l>
            <l>But thy soft note — its only joy —</l>
            <l>E'en so the words of love beguile</l>
            <l>When pleasure's tree no flower bears,</l>

            <l>The wondering spirits of heaven were mute,</l>

            <l>Four laurell'd spirits, heaven-ward to intreat him.</l>
            <l>With reverence would we speak of all the sages</l>

            <l>Of genius, to flap away each sting</l>
            <l>Thrown by the pitiless world. We next could tell</l>

            <l>Of him whose name to ev'ry heart's a solace,</l>

            <l>While to the rugged north our musing turns</l>

            <l>A black-eyed swan upon the widening stream;</l>
            <l>And when thou first didst in that mirror trace</l>
            <l>The placid features of a human face</l>
            <l>That thou hast never told thy travels strange,</l>

            <l>Lo!  I must tell a tale of chivalry;</l>
            <l>For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye.</l>
            <l>Not like the formal crest of latter days</l>
            <l>But bending in a thousand graceful ways;</l>
            <l>So graceful, that it seems no mortal hand,</l>
            <l>Or e'en the touch of Archimago's wand,</l>
            <l>Could charm them into such an attitude.</l>
            <l>We must think rather, that in playful mood,</l>
            <l>Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight,</l>
            <l>To show this wonder of its gentle might.</l>
            <l>Lo!  I must tell a tale of chivalry;</l>
            <l>For while I muse, the lance points slantingly</l>
            <l>Athwart the morning air:   some lady sweet,</l>
            <l>Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet,</l>
            <l>From the worn top of some old battlement</l>
            <l>Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent:</l>
            <l>And from her own pure self no joy dissembling,</l>
            <l>Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling.</l>
            <l>Sometimes, when the good knight his rest would take,</l>
            <l>It is reflected, clearly, in a lake,</l>
            <l>With the young ashen boughs, 'gainst which it rests,</l>
            <l>And th' half seen mossiness of linnets' nests.</l>
            <l>Ah!  shall I ever tell its cruelty,</l>
            <l>When the fire flashes from a warrior's eye,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="48"/>
            <l>And his tremendous hand is grasping it,</l>
            <l>And his dark brow for very wrath is knit?</l>
            <l>Or when his spirit, with more calm intent,</l>
            <l>Leaps to the honors of a tournament,</l>
            <l>And makes the gazers round about the ring</l>
            <l>Stare at the grandeur of the ballancing?</l>
            <l>No, no!  this is far off:   — then how shall I</l>
            <l>Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy,</l>
            <l>Which linger yet about lone gothic arches,</l>
            <l>In dark green ivy, and among wild larches?</l>
            <l>How sing the splendour of the revelries,</l>
            <l>When buts of wine are drunk off to the lees?</l>
            <l>And that bright lance, against the fretted wall,</l>
            <l>Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield,</l>
            <l>Where ye may see a spur in bloody field?</l>
            <l>Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces</l>
            <l>Round the wide hall, and show their happy faces;</l>
            <l>Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens:</l>
            <l>Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens.</l>
            <l>Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry:</l>
            <l>Or wherefore comes that steed so proudly by?</l>
            <l>Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight</l>
            <l>Rein in the swelling of his ample might?</l>
            <l>Spenser!  thy brows are arched, open, kind,</l>
            <l>And come like a clear sun-rise to my mind;</l>
            <l>And always does my heart with pleasure dance,</l>
            <l>When I think on thy noble countenance</l>
            <l>Where never yet was ought more earthly seen</l>
            <l>Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green.</l>
            <l>Therefore, great bard, I not so fearfully</l>
            <l>Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh</l>
            <l>My daring steps:   or if thy tender care,</l>
            <l>Thus startled unaware,</l>
            <l>Be jealous that the foot of other wight</l>
            <l>Should madly follow that bright path of light</l>
            <l>Trac'd by thy lov'd Libertas; he will speak,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="49"/>
            <l>And tell thee that my prayer is very meek;</l>
            <l>That I will follow with due reverence,</l>
            <l>And start with awe at mine own strange pretence.</l>
            <l>Him thou wilt hear; so I will rest in hope</l>
            <l>To see wide plains, fair trees and lawny slope</l>
            <l>The morn, the eve, the light, the shade, the flowers;</l>
            <l>Clear streams, smooth lakes, and overlooking towers.</l>

            <l>Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake;</l>
            <l>His healthful spirit eager and awake</l>
            <l>To feel the beauty of a silent eve,</l>
            <l>Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave;</l>
            <l>The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.</l>
            <l>He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,</l>
            <l>And smiles at the far clearness all around,</l>
            <l>Until his heart is well nigh over wound,</l>
            <l>And turns for calmness to the pleasant green</l>
            <l>Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean</l>
            <l>And show their blossoms trim.</l>
            <l>Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow</l>
            <l>The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow,</l>

            <l>And now the sharp keel of his little boat</l>
            <l>Comes up with ripple, and with easy float,</l>
            <l>And glides into a bed of water lillies:</l>
            <l>Broad leav'd are they and their white canopies</l>
            <l>Are upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew.</l>
            <l>Near to a little island's point they grew;</l>

            <l>Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view</l>

            <l>Went off in gentle windings to the hoar</l>
            <l>And light blue mountains:   but no breathing man</l>
            <l>With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan</l>
            <l>Nature's clear beauty, could pass lightly by</l>
            <l>Objects that look'd out so invitingly</l>

            <l>Greeted, as he had known them long before.</l>
            <l>The sidelong view of swelling leafiness,</l>
            <l>Which the glad setting sun in gold doth dress;</l>
            <l>Whence ever and anon the jay outsprings,</l>
            <l>And scales upon the beauty of its wings.</l>
            <l>The lonely turret, shatter'd, and outworn,</l>
            <l>Stands venerably proud; too proud to mourn</l>
            <l>Its long lost grandeur:   fir trees grow around,</l>
            <l>Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.</l>
            <l>The little chapel with the cross above</l>
            <l>Upholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove,</l>
            <l>That on the window spreads his feathers light,</l>
            <l>And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.</l>
            <l>Green tufted islands casting their soft shades</l>
            <l>Across the lake; sequester'd leafy glades,</l>
            <l>That through the dimness of their twilight show</l>
            <l>Large dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow</l>
            <l>Of the wild cat's eyes, or the silvery stems</l>
            <l>Of delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems</l>
            <l>These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing</l>
            <l>The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught</l>
            <l>A trumpet's silver voice. Ah!  it was fraught</l>
            <l>With many joys for him:   the warder's ken</l>
            <l>Had found white coursers prancing in the glen:</l>
            <l>Friends very dear to him he soon will see;</l>

            <l>And soon upon the lake he skims along,</l>

            <l>Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly:</l>
            <l>His spirit flies before him so completely.</l>
            <l>And now he turns a jutting point of land,</l>
            <l>Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand</l>
            <l>Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches,</l>
            <l>Before the point of his light shallop reaches</l>
            <l>Those marble steps that through the water dip</l>
            <l>Now over them he goes with hasty trip,</l>
            <l>And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors</l>
            <l>Anon he leaps along the oaken floors</l>
            <l>Of halls and corridors.</l>
            <l>Delicious sounds!  those little bright-eyed things</l>
            <l>That float about the air on azure wings,</l>
            <l>Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang</l>
            <l>Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang,</l>
            <l>Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain,</l>
            <l>Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein;</l>
            <l>While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis</l>
            <l>They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,</l>
            <l>What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand!</l>

            <l>Made him delay to let their tender feet</l>
            <l>Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet</l>
            <l>From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent</l>
            <l>And whether there were tears of languishment,</l>
            <l>Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses,</l>
            <l>He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses</l>
            <l>With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye</l>
            <l>All the soft luxury</l>
            <l>That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,</l>
            <l>Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers</l>
            <l>Of whitest cassia, fresh from summer showers</l>
            <l>And this he fondled with his happy cheek</l>
            <l>As if for joy he would no further seek;</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="52"/>
            <l>When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond</l>
            <l>Came to his ear, like something from beyond</l>
            <l>His present being:   so he gently drew</l>
            <l>His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,</l>
            <l>From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,</l>
            <l>Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending;</l>
            <l>While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd</l>
            <l>A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd;</l>
            <l>A hand that from the world's bleak promontory</l>
            <l>Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.</l>
            <l>Amid the pages, and the torches' glare</l>
            <l>There stood a knight, patting the flowing hair</l>
            <l>Of his proud horse's mane:   he was withal</l>
            <l>A man of elegance, and stature tall:</l>
            <l>So that the waving of his plumes would be</l>
            <l>High as the berries of a wild ash tree,</l>
            <l>Or as the winged cap of Mercury.</l>
            <l>His armour was so dexterously wrought</l>
            <l>In shape, that sure no living man had thought</l>
            <l>It hard, and heavy steel:   but that indeed</l>
            <l>It was some glorious form, some splendid weed,</l>
            <l>In which a spirit new come from the skies</l>
            <l>Might live, and show itself to human eyes.</l>
            <l>'Tis the far-fam'd, the brave Sir Gondibert,</l>
            <l>Said the good man to Calidore alert;</l>
            <l>While the young warrior with a step of grace</l>
            <l>Came up, — a courtly smile upon his face,</l>
            <l>And mailed hand held out, ready to greet</l>
            <l>The large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat</l>
            <l>Of the aspiring boy; who as he led</l>
            <l>Those smiling ladies, often turned his head</l>
            <l>To admire the visor arched so gracefully</l>
            <l>Over a knightly brow; while they went by</l>
            <l>The lamps that from the high-roof'd hall were pendent,</l>
            <l>And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.</l>
            <l>Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated;</l>
            <l>The sweet-lipp'd ladies have already greeted</l>
            <l>All the green leaves that round the window clamber,</l>
            <l>To show their purple stars, and bells of amber.</l>
            <l>Sir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel,</l>
            <l>Gladdening in the free and airy feel</l>
            <l>Of a light mantle; and while Clerimond</l>
            <l>Is looking round about him with a fond</l>
            <l>And placid eye, young Calidore is burning</l>
            <l>To hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning</l>
            <l>Of all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm</l>
            <l>Kept off dismay, and terror, and alarm</l>
            <l>From lovely woman   while brimful of this,</l>
            <l>He gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss,</l>
            <l>And had such manly ardour in his eye,</l>
            <l>That each at other look'd half staringly;</l>
            <l>And then their features started into smiles</l>
            <l>Sweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles.</l>
            <l>Softly the breezes from the forest came,</l>
            <l>Softly they blew aside the taper's flame;</l>
            <l>Clear was the song from Philomel's far bower;</l>
            <l>Grateful the incense from the lime-tree flower;</l>
            <l>Mysterious, wild, the far heard trumpet's tone;</l>
            <l>Lovely the moon in ether, all alone</l>
            <l>Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals,</l>
            <l>As that of busy spirits when the portals</l>
            <l>Are closing in the west; or that soft humming</l>
            <l>We hear around when Hesperus is coming.</l>

            <l>And what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call,</l>

            <l>When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear,</l>
            <l>Whose tones reach naught on earth but Poet's ear.</l>

            <l>And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide,</l>
            <l>The Poet's eye can reach those golden halls,</l>
            <l>And view the glory of their festivals</l>
            <l>Their ladies fair, that in the distance seem</l>
            <l>Fit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream;</l>
            <l>Their rich brimm'd goblets, that incessant run</l>
            <l>Like the bright spots that move about the sun;</l>

            <l>E'en now I'm pillow'd on a bed of flowers</l>
            <l>That crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers</l>
            <l>Above the ocean-waves. The stalks, and blades,</l>
            <l>Chequer my tablet with their quivering shades.</l>
            <l>On one side is a field of drooping oats,</l>
            <l>Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats;</l>
            <l>So pert and useless, that they bring to mind</l>
            <l>The scarlet coats that pester human-kind.</l>
            <l>And on the other side, outspread, is seen</l>
            <l>Ocean's blue mantle streak'd with purple, and green.</l>
            <l>Now 'tis I see a canvass'd ship, and now</l>
            <l>Mark the bright silver curling round her prow.</l>
            <l>I see the lark down-dropping to his nest,</l>
            <l>And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;</l>
            <l>For when no more he spreads his feathers free,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="60"/>
            <l>His breast is dancing on the restless sea.</l>
            <l>Now I direct my eyes into the west,</l>
            <l>Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest</l>
            <l>Why westward turn?  'twas but to say adieu!</l>
            <l>'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you!</l>

            <head> To Charles Cowden Clarke</head>
            <l>Oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning,</l>
            <l>He slants his neck beneath the waters bright</l>
            <l>So silently, it seems a beam of light</l>
            <l>Come from the Galaxy   anon he sports, —</l>
            <l>With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts,</l>
            <l>Or ruffles all the surface of the lake</l>
            <l>In striving from its crystal face to take</l>
            <l>Some diamond water drops, and them to treasure</l>
            <l>In milky nest, and sip them off at leisure.</l>
            <l>But not a moment can he there insure them,</l>
            <l>Nor to such downy rest can he allure them;</l>
            <l>For down they rush as though they would be free,</l>
            <l>And drop like hours into eternity.</l>
            <l>Just like that bird am I in loss of time,</l>
            <l>Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme;</l>
            <l>With shatter'd boat, oar snapt, and canvass rent,</l>
            <l>I slowly sail, scarce knowing my intent;</l>
            <l>Still scooping up the water with my fingers,</l>
            <l>In which a trembling diamond never lingers.</l>
            <l>By this, friend Charles, you may full plainly see</l>
            <l>Why I have never penn'd a line to thee</l>
            <l>Because my thoughts were never free, and clear,</l>
            <l>And little fit to please a classic ear;</l>
            <l>Because my wine was of too poor a savour</l>
            <l>For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour</l>
            <l>Of sparkling Helicon   — small good it were</l>
            <l>To take him to a desert rude, and bare,</l>
            <l>Who had on Baiae's shore reclin'd at ease,</l>
            <l>While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze</l>
            <l>That gave soft music from Armida's bowers,</l>
            <l>Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers</l>
            <l>Small good to one who had by Mulla's stream</l>
            <l>Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream;</l>
            <l>Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook,</l>
            <l>And lovely Una in a leafy nook,</l>
            <l>And Archimago leaning o'er his book</l>
            <l>Who had of all that's sweet tasted, and seen,</l>
            <l>From silv'ry ripple, up to beauty's queen;</l>
            <l>From the sequester'd haunts of gay Titania,</l>
            <l>To the blue dwelling of divine Urania</l>
            <l>One, who, of late, had ta'en sweet forest walks</l>
            <l>With him who elegantly chats, and talks —</l>
            <l>The wrong'd Libertas, — who has told you stories</l>
            <l>Of troops chivalrous prancing through a city,</l>
            <l>And tearful ladies made for love, and pity</l>
            <l>With many else which I have never known.</l>
            <l>Thus have I thought; and days on days have flown</l>
            <l>Slowly, or rapidly — unwilling still</l>
            <l>For you to try my dull, unlearned quill.</l>
            <l>Nor should I now, but that I've known you long;</l>
            <l>That you first taught me all the sweets of song</l>
            <l>The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine;</l>
            <l>What swell'd with pathos, and what right divine</l>
            <l>Spenserian vowels that elope with ease,</l>
            <l>And float along like birds o'er summer seas;</l>
            <l>Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness;</l>
            <l>Michael in arms, and more, meek Eve's fair slenderness.</l>
            <l>Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly</l>
            <l>Up to its climax and then dying proudly?</l>
            <l>Who found for me the grandeur of the ode,</l>
            <l>Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load?</l>
            <l>Who let me taste that more than cordial dram,</l>
            <l>The sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram?</l>
            <l>Shew'd me that epic was of all the king,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="62"/>
            <l>Round, vast, and spanning all like Saturn's ring?</l>
            <l>You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty,</l>
            <l>And pointed out the patriot's stern duty;</l>
            <l>The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell;</l>
            <l>The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell</l>
            <l>Upon a tyrant's head. Ah!  had I never seen,</l>
            <l>Or known your kindness, what might I have been?</l>
            <l>What my enjoyments in my youthful years,</l>
            <l>Bereft of all that now my life endears?</l>
            <l>And can I e'er these benefits forget?</l>
            <l>And can I e'er repay the friendly debt?</l>
            <l>No, doubly no; — yet should these rhymings please,</l>
            <l>I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease</l>
            <l>For I have long time been my fancy feeding</l>
            <l>With hopes that you would one day think the reading</l>

            <l>Should it e'er be so, what a rich content!</l>
            <l>Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires</l>
            <l>In lucent Thames reflected   — warm desires</l>
            <l>And morning shadows streaking into slimness</l>
            <l>Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water;</l>
            <l>To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter;</l>
            <l>To feel the air that plays about the hills,</l>
            <l>And sips its freshness from the little rills;</l>
            <l>To see high, golden corn wave in the light</l>
            <l>When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night,</l>
            <l>And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white,</l>

            <l>Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed —</l>
            <l>No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures</l>
            <l>Than I began to think of rhymes and measures</l>

            <l>Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter.</l>

            <l>Good Kosciusko, thy great name alone</l>
            <l>It comes upon us like the glorious pealing</l>
            <l>Of the wide spheres — an everlasting tone.</l>
            <l>And now it tells me, that in worlds unknown,</l>
            <l>The names of heroes, burst from clouds concealing,</l>
            <l>Are changed to harmonies, for ever stealing</l>
            <l>Through cloudless blue, and round each silver throne.</l>
            <l>It tells me too, that on a happy day,</l>
            <l>When some good spirit walks upon the earth,</l>
            <l>Thy name with Alfred's, and the great of yore</l>
            <l>Gently commingling, gives tremendous birth</l>
            <l>To a loud hymn, that sounds far, far away</l>
            <l>To where the great God lives for evermore.</l>

            <l>What is more gentle than a wind in summer?</l>
            <l>What is more soothing than the pretty hummer</l>
            <l>That stays one moment in an open flower,</l>
            <l>And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower?</l>
            <l>What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing</l>
            <l>In a green island, far from all men's knowing?</l>
            <l>More healthful than the leafiness of dales?</l>
            <l>More secret than a nest of nightingales?</l>
            <l>More serene than Cordelia's countenance?</l>
            <l>More full of visions than a high romance?</l>
            <l>What, but thee, Sleep?  Soft closer of our eyes!</l>
            <l>Low murmurer of tender lullabies!</l>
            <l>Light hoverer around our happy pillows!</l>
            <l>Wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows!</l>
            <l>Silent entangler of a beauty's tresses!</l>
            <l>Most happy listener!  when the morning blesses</l>
            <l>Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes</l>
            <l>That glance so brightly at the new sun-rise.</l>
            <l>But what is higher beyond thought than thee?</l>
            <l>Fresher than berries of a mountain tree?</l>
            <l>More strange, more beautiful, more smooth, more regal,</l>
            <l>Than wings of swans, than doves, than dim-seen eagle?</l>
            <l>What is it?  And to what shall I compare it?</l>
            <l>It has a glory, and nought else can share it</l>
            <l>The thought thereof is awful, sweet, and holy,</l>
            <l>Chacing away all worldliness and folly;</l>
            <l>Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder,</l>
            <l>Or the low rumblings earth's regions under;</l>

            <l>That breathes about us in the vacant air;</l>

            <l>Perhaps to see shapes of light, aerial lymning,</l>

            <l>To see the laurel wreath, on high suspended,</l>
            <l>That is to crown our name when life is ended.</l>
            <l>Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice,</l>
            <l>And from the heart up-springs " rejoice!  rejoice!"</l>
            <l>Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things,</l>
            <l>And die away in ardent mutterings.</l>
            <l>No one who once the glorious sun has seen,</l>
            <l>And all the clouds, and felt his bosom clean</l>
            <l>For his great Maker's presence, but must know</l>
            <l>What 'tis I mean, and feel his being glow</l>
            <l>Therefore no insult will I give his spirit,</l>
            <l>By telling what he sees from native merit.</l>
            <l>O Poesy!  for thee I hold my pen</l>
            <l>That am not yet a glorious denizen</l>
            <l>Of thy wide heaven — Should I rather kneel</l>
            <l>Upon some mountain-top until I feel</l>
            <l>A glowing splendour round about me hung,</l>
            <l>And echo back the voice of thine own tongue?</l>
            <l>O Poesy!  for thee I grasp my pen</l>
            <l>That am not yet a glorious denizen</l>
            <l>Of thy wide heaven; yet, to my ardent prayer,</l>
            <l>Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air,</l>
            <l>Smoothed for intoxication by the breath</l>
            <l>Of flowering bays, that I may die a death</l>
            <l>Of luxury, and my young spirit follow</l>
            <l>The morning sun-beams to the great Apollo</l>

            <l>And many a verse from so strange influence</l>
            <l>That we must ever wonder how, and whence</l>
            <l>It came. Also imaginings will hover</l>

            <l>All that was for our human senses fitted.</l>
            <l>Then the events of this wide world I'd seize</l>
            <l>Like a strong giant, and my spirit teaze</l>
            <l>Till at its shoulders it should proudly see</l>
            <l>Wings to find out an immortality.</l>
            <l>Stop and consider!  life is but a day;</l>
            <l>A fragile dew-drop on its perilous way</l>
            <l>From a tree's summit; a poor Indian's sleep</l>
            <l>While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep</l>
            <l>Of Montmorenci. Why so sad a moan?</l>
            <l>Life is the rose's hope while yet unblown;</l>
            <l>The reading of an ever-changing tale;</l>
            <l>The light uplifting of a maiden's veil;</l>
            <l>A pigeon tumbling in clear summer air;</l>
            <l>A laughing school-boy, without grief or care,</l>
            <l>Riding the springy branches of an elm.</l>
            <l>O for ten years, that I may overwhelm</l>
            <l>Myself in poesy; so I may do the deed</l>
            <l>That my own soul has to itself decreed.</l>
            <l>Then will I pass the countries that I see</l>
            <l>In long perspective, and continually</l>
            <l>Taste their pure fountains. First the realm I'll pass</l>
            <l>Of Flora, and old Pan   sleep in the grass,</l>
            <l>Feed upon apples red, and strawberries,</l>
            <l>And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees;</l>
            <l>Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places,</l>
            <l>To woo sweet kisses from averted faces, —</l>
            <l>Play with their fingers, touch their shoulders white</l>
            <l>Into a pretty shrinking with a bite</l>
            <l>As hard as lips can make it   till agreed,</l>
            <l>A lovely tale of human life we'll read.</l>
            <l>And one will teach a tame dove how it best</l>

            <l>Another, bending o'er her nimble tread,</l>

            <l>Smiling upon the flowers and the trees</l>
            <l>Another will entice me on, and on</l>
            <l>Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon;</l>
            <l>Till in the bosom of a leafy world</l>
            <l>We rest in silence, like two gems upcurl'd</l>
            <l>In the recesses of a pearly shell.</l>
            <l>And can I ever bid these joys farewell?</l>
            <l>Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,</l>
            <l>Where I may find the agonies, the strife</l>
            <l>Of human hearts   for lo!  I see afar,</l>
            <l>O'er-sailing the blue cragginess, a car</l>
            <l>And steeds with streamy manes — the charioteer</l>
            <l>Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear</l>
            <l>And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly</l>
            <l>Along a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly</l>
            <l>Wheel downward come they into fresher skies,</l>
            <l>Tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes.</l>
            <l>Still downward with capacious whirl they glide;</l>
            <l>And now I see them on a green-hill's side</l>
            <l>In breezy rest among the nodding stalks.</l>
            <l>The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks</l>
            <l>To the trees and mountains; and there soon appear</l>
            <l>Shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,</l>
            <l>Passing along before a dusky space</l>
            <l>Made by some mighty oaks   as they would chase</l>
            <l>Some ever-fleeting music on they sweep.</l>
            <l>Lo!  how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep</l>
            <l>Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;</l>
            <l>Some with their faces muffled to the ear</l>
            <l>Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,</l>
            <l>Go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom;</l>
            <l>Some looking back, and some with upward gaze;</l>
            <l>Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways</l>
            <l>Flit onward — now a lovely wreath of girls</l>
            <l>Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;</l>
            <l>And now broad wings. Most awfully intent</l>
            <l>The driver of those steeds is forward bent,</l>
            <l>And seems to listen:  O that I might know</l>
            <l>All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.</l>
            <l>The visions all are fled — the car is fled</l>
            <l>Into the light of heaven, and in their stead</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="73"/>
            <l>A sense of real things comes doubly strong,</l>
            <l>My soul to nothingness   but I will strive</l>
            <l>Against all doubtings, and will keep alive</l>
            <l>The thought of that same chariot, and the strange</l>
            <l>Journey it went. Is there so small a range</l>
            <l>In the present strength of manhood, that the high</l>
            <l>Imagination cannot freely fly</l>
            <l>As she was wont of old?  prepare her steeds,</l>
            <l>Paw up against the light, and do strange deeds</l>
            <l>Upon the clouds?  Has she not shewn us all?</l>
            <l>From the clear space of ether, to the small</l>
            <l>Breath of new buds unfolding?  From the meaning</l>
            <l>Of Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening</l>
            <l>Of April meadows?  Here her altar shone,</l>
            <l>E'en in this isle; and who could paragon</l>
            <l>The fervid choir that lifted up a noise</l>
            <l>Of harmony, to where it aye will poise</l>
            <l>Its mighty self of convoluting sound,</l>
            <l>Huge as a planet, and like that roll round,</l>
            <l>Eternally around a dizzy void?</l>
            <l>Ay, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd</l>
            <l>With honors; nor had any other care</l>
            <l>Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair.</l>
            <l>Could all this be forgotten?  yes, a schism</l>
            <l>Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,</l>
            <l>Made great Apollo blush for this his land.</l>
            <l>Men were thought wise who could not understand</l>
            <l>His glories   with a puling infant's force</l>
            <l>They sway'd about upon a rocking horse,</l>
            <l>And thought it Pegasus. Ah dismal soul'd!</l>
            <l>The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd</l>

            <l>Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew</l>

            <l>The morning precious   beauty was awake!</l>
            <l>Why were ye not awake?  But ye were dead</l>

            <l>That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,</l>
            <l>And did not know it, — no, they went about,</l>

            <l>Delight you?  Did ye never cluster round</l>
            <l>Delicious Avon, with a mournful sound,</l>
            <l>And weep?  Or did ye wholly bid adieu</l>
            <l>To regions where no more the laurel grew?</l>
            <l>Or did ye stay to give a welcoming</l>
            <l>To some lone spirits who could proudly sing</l>
            <l>Their youth away, and die?  'Twas even so</l>
            <l>But let me think away those times of woe</l>

            <l>'Twere better far to hide my foolish face?</l>
            <l>That whining boyhood should with reverence bow</l>
            <l>Ere the dread thunderbolt could reach?  How!</l>
            <l>If I do hide myself, it sure shall be</l>
            <l>In the very fane, the light of Poesy</l>
            <l>If I do fall, at least I will be laid</l>

            <l>They should not know thee, who athirst to gain</l>

            <l>Therefrom my liberty; thence too I've seen</l>
            <l>The end and aim of poesy. 'Tis clear</l>
            <l>As any thing most true; as that the year</l>
            <l>Is made of the four seasons — manifest</l>
            <l>As a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,</l>
            <l>Lifted to the white clouds. Therefore should I</l>

            <l>A coward, did my very eye-lids wink</l>

            <l>Ah!  rather let me like a madman run</l>
            <l>Over some precipice; let the hot sun</l>
            <l>Melt my Dedalian wings, and drive me down</l>
            <l>Convuls'd and headlong!  Stay!  an inward frown</l>
            <l>Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile.</l>
            <l>An ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,</l>
            <l>Spreads awfully before me. How much toil!</l>
            <l>How many days!  what desperate turmoil!</l>
            <l>Ere I can have explored its widenesses.</l>
            <l>Ah, what a task!  upon my bended knees,</l>
            <l>I could unsay those — no, impossible!</l>
            <l>Impossible!  for sweet relief I'll dwell</l>
            <l>On humbler thoughts, and let this strange assay</l>

            <l>The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet</l>
            <l>Into the brain ere one can think upon it;</l>
            <l>The silence when some rhymes are coming out;</l>
            <l>And when they're come, the very pleasant rout</l>

            <l>The message certain to be done to-morrow —</l>
            <l>'Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow</l>
            <l>Some precious book from out its snug retreat,</l>
            <l>To cluster round it when we next shall meet.</l>
            <l>Scarce can I scribble on; for lovely airs</l>
            <l>Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs;</l>
            <l>Many delights of that glad day recalling,</l>
            <l>And with these airs come forms of elegance</l>
            <l>Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance,</l>
            <l>Careless, and grand — fingers soft and round</l>
            <l>Parting luxuriant curls; — and the swift bound</l>
            <l>Of Bacchus from his chariot, when his eye</l>
            <l>Made Ariadne's cheek look blushingly.</l>
            <l>Thus I remember all the pleasant flow</l>
            <l>Of words at opening a portfolio.</l>
            <l>Things such as these are ever harbingers</l>
            <l>To trains of peaceful images   the stirs</l>
            <l>Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes</l>
            <l>A linnet starting all about the bushes</l>
            <l>A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted,</l>
            <l>Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted</l>
            <l>With over pleasure — many, many more,</l>
            <l>Might I indulge at large in all my store</l>
            <l>Of luxuries   yet I must not forget</l>
            <l>Sleep, quiet with his poppy coronet</l>
            <l>For what there may be worthy in these rhymes</l>
            <l>I partly owe to him — and thus   the chimes</l>
            <l>Of friendly voices had just given place</l>
            <l>To as sweet a silence, when I 'gan retrace</l>
            <l>The pleasant day, upon a couch at ease.</l>
            <l>It was a poet's house who keeps the keys</l>
            <l>Of pleasure's temple. Round about were hung</l>
            <l>The glorious features of the bards who sung</l>
            <l>In other ages — cold and sacred busts</l>
            <l>Smiled at each other. Happy he who trusts</l>
            <l>To clear futurity his darling fame!</l>
            <l>Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim</l>
            <l>At swelling apples with a frisky leap</l>
            <l>And reaching fingers, 'mid a luscious heap</l>
            <l>Of vine leaves. Then there rose to view a fane</l>
            <l>Of liny marble, and thereto a train</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="78"/>
            <l>Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward</l>
            <l>One, loveliest, holding her white hand toward</l>
            <l>The dazzling sun-rise   two sisters sweet</l>
            <l>Bending their graceful figures till they meet</l>
            <l>Over the trippings of a little child</l>
            <l>And some are hearing, eagerly, the wild</l>
            <l>Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping.</l>
            <l>See, in another picture, nymphs are wiping</l>
            <l>Cherishingly Diana's timorous limbs; —</l>
            <l>At the bath's edge, and keeps a gentle motion</l>
            <l>With the subsiding crystal   as when ocean</l>
            <l>Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothness o'er</l>
            <l>Its rocky marge, and balances once more</l>
            <l>The patient weeds; that now unshent by foam</l>
            <l>Feel all about their undulating home.</l>
            <l>Sappho's meek head was there half smiling down</l>
            <l>At nothing; just as though the earnest frown</l>
            <l>Of over thinking had that moment gone</l>
            <l>From off her brow, and left her all alone.</l>
            <l>Great Alfred's too, with anxious, pitying eyes,</l>
            <l>As if he always listened to the sighs</l>
            <l>Of the goaded world; and Kosciusko's worn</l>
            <l>By horrid suffrance — mightily forlorn.</l>
            <l>Petrarch, outstepping from the shady green,</l>
            <l>Starts at the sight of Laura; nor can wean</l>
            <l>His eyes from her sweet face. Most happy they!</l>
            <l>For over them was seen a free display</l>
            <l>Of out-spread wings, and from between them shone</l>
            <l>The face of Poesy   from off her throne</l>
            <l>She overlook'd things that I scarce could tell.</l>
            <l>The very sense of where I was might well</l>
            <l>Keep Sleep aloof   but more than that there came</l>
            <l>Thought after thought to nourish up the flame</l>
            <l>Within my breast; so that the morning light</l>
            <l>Surprised me even from a sleepless night;</l>
            <l>And up I rose refresh'd, and glad, and gay,</l>
            <l>Resolving to begin that very day</l>
            <l>These lines; and howsoever they be done,</l>
            <l>I leave them as a father does his son.</l>

            <head>I stood tip-toe upon a little hill</head>
            <l>I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,</l>
            <l>The air was cooling, and so very still,</l>
            <l>That the sweet buds which with a modest pride</l>
            <l>Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,</l>
            <l>Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,</l>
            <l>Had not yet lost those starry diadems</l>
            <l>Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.</l>
            <l>The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,</l>
            <l>And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept</l>
            <l>On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept</l>
            <l>Born of the very sigh that silence heaves</l>
            <l>For not the faintest motion could be seen</l>
            <l>Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green.</l>
            <l>There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye,</l>
            <l>To peer about upon variety;</l>
            <l>Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim,</l>
            <l>And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;</l>
            <l>To picture out the quaint, and curious bending</l>

            <l>Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending;</l>
            <l>Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,</l>
            <l>Guess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves.</l>
            <l>I gazed awile, and felt as light, and free</l>
            <l>As though the fanning wings of Mercury</l>
            <l>Had played upon my heels   I was light-hearted,</l>
            <l>And many pleasures to my vision started;</l>
            <l>So I straightway began to pluck a posey</l>
            <l>Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy.</l>
            <l>A bush of May flowers with the bees about them;</l>
            <l>Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;</l>
            <l>And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,</l>
            <l>And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them</l>
            <l>Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,</l>
            <l>That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.</l>
            <l>A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined,</l>
            <l>And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind</l>
            <l>Upon their summer thrones; there too should be</l>
            <l>The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,</l>
            <l>That with a score of light green brethren shoots</l>
            <l>From the quaint mossiness of aged roots</l>
            <l>Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters</l>
            <l>Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters</l>
            <l>The spreading blue bells   it may haply mourn</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="82"/>
            <l>That such fair clusters should be rudely torn</l>
            <l>From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly</l>
            <l>By infant hands, left on the path to die.</l>
            <l>Open afresh your round of starry folds,</l>
            <l>Ye ardent marigolds!</l>

            <l>Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight</l>

            <l>Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach</l>

            <l>A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds;</l>
            <l>Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,</l>
            <l>Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the streams,</l>
            <l>To taste the luxury of sunny beams</l>
            <l>Temper'd with coolness. How they ever wrestle</l>
            <l>With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle</l>

            <l>But turn your eye, and they are there again.</l>
            <l>The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,</l>
            <l>And cool themselves among the em'rald tresses;</l>
            <l>The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,</l>
            <l>And moisture, that the bowery green may live</l>

            <l>Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop</l>

            <l>Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,</l>
            <l>To bow for gratitude before Jove's throne.</l>
            <l>So did he feel, who pull'd the boughs aside,</l>
            <l>That we might look into a forest wide,</l>
            <l>To catch a glimpse of Fauns, and Dryades</l>
            <l>Coming with softest rustle through the trees;</l>
            <l>And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="85"/>
            <l>Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet</l>
            <l>Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled</l>
            <l>Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.</l>
            <l>Poor nymph, — poor Pan, — how he did weep to find,</l>
            <l>Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind</l>
            <l>Along the reedy stream; a half heard strain,</l>
            <l>Full of sweet desolation — balmy pain.</l>
            <l>What first inspired a bard of old to sing</l>
            <l>Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring?</l>
            <l>In some delicious ramble, he had found</l>
            <l>A little space, with boughs all woven round;</l>
            <l>And in the midst of all, a clearer pool</l>
            <l>Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool</l>
            <l>The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping</l>
            <l>Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.</l>
            <l>And on the bank a lonely flower he spied,</l>
            <l>A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,</l>
            <l>Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness,</l>
            <l>To woo its own sad image into nearness</l>
            <l>Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;</l>
            <l>But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love</l>
            <l>So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,</l>
            <l>Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot;</l>
            <l>Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo's bale.</l>
            <l>Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew</l>
            <l>That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="86"/>
            <l>That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,</l>
            <l>Coming ever to bless</l>
            <l>The wanderer by moonlight?  to him bringing</l>
            <l>Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing</l>
            <l>From out the middle air, from flowery nests,</l>
            <l>And from the pillowy silkiness that rests</l>
            <l>Full in the speculation of the stars.</l>
            <l>Ah!  surely he had burst our mortal bars;</l>
            <l>Into some wond'rous region he had gone,</l>
            <l>To search for thee, divine Endymion!</l>
            <l>He was a Poet, sure a lover too,</l>
            <l>Who stood on Latmus' top, what time there blew</l>
            <l>Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;</l>
            <l>And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow</l>
            <l>A hymn from Dian's temple; while upswelling,</l>
            <l>The incense went to her own starry dwelling.</l>
            <l>But though her face was clear as infant's eyes,</l>
            <l>Though she stood smiling o'er the sacrifice,</l>
            <l>The Poet wept at her so piteous fate,</l>
            <l>Wept that such beauty should be desolate</l>
            <l>So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,</l>
            <l>And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.</l>
            <l>Queen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen</l>
            <l>Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!</l>

            <l>O for three words of honey, that I might</l>
            <l>Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!</l>
            <l>Where distant ships do seem to show their keels,</l>
            <l>Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,</l>
            <l>And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,</l>
            <l>Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize.</l>
            <l>The evening weather was so bright, and clear,</l>
            <l>That men of health were of unusual cheer;</l>
            <l>Stepping like Homer at the trumpet's call,</l>
            <l>Or young Apollo on the pedestal</l>
            <l>And lovely women were as fair and warm,</l>
            <l>As Venus looking sideways in alarm.</l>
            <l>The breezes were ethereal, and pure,</l>
            <l>The languid sick; it cool'd their fever'd sleep,</l>
            <l>And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.</l>
            <l>Soon they awoke clear eyed   nor burnt with thirsting,</l>
            <l>Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting</l>
            <l>And springing up, they met the wond'ring sight</l>
            <l>Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;</l>
            <l>Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,</l>
            <l>And on their placid foreheads part the hair.</l>
            <l>Young men, and maidens at each other gaz'd</l>
            <l>With hands held back, and motionless, amaz'd</l>
            <l>To see the brightness in each other's eyes;</l>
            <l>And so they stood, fill'd with a sweet surprise,</l>
            <l>Until their tongues were loos'd in poesy.</l>
            <l>Therefore no lover did of anguish die</l>
            <l>But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,</l>
            <l>Made silken ties, that never may be broken.</l>

            <l>Earnestly round as wishing to espy</l>
            <l>Some folk of holiday   nor had they waited</l>
            <l>For many moments, ere their ears were sated</l>
            <l>With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then</l>
            <l>Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.</l>
            <l>Within a little space again it gave</l>
            <l>Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,</l>
            <l>To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking</l>
            <l>Through copse-clad vallies, — ere their death, o'ertaking</l>
            <l>The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.</l>
            <l>And now, as deep into the wood as we</l>

            <l>Fair faces and a rush of garments white,</l>
            <l>Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last</l>
            <l>Making directly for the woodland altar.</l>

            <l>From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,</l>
            <l>Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;</l>
            <l>And in his left he held a basket full</l>

            <l>Of idleness in groves Elysian</l>
            <l>But there were some who feelingly could scan</l>
            <l>A lurking trouble in his nether lip,</l>
            <l>And see that oftentimes the reins would slip</l>
            <l>Through his forgotten hands   then would they sigh,</l>

            <l>Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,</l>
            <l>Who whispers him so pantingly and close?</l>
            <l>Peona, his sweet sister   of all those,</l>
            <l>His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,</l>
            <l>And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade</l>
            <l>A yielding up, a cradling on her care.</l>
            <l>Her eloquence did breathe away the curse</l>
            <l>She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse</l>
            <l>Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,</l>
            <l>Along a path between two little streams, —</l>
            <l>Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,</l>
            <l>From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow</l>
            <l>From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;</l>
            <l>Until they came to where these streamlets fall,</l>
            <l>With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,</l>
            <l>Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush</l>
            <l>With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.</l>
            <l>A little shallop, floating there hard by,</l>
            <l>Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;</l>
            <l>And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,</l>
            <l>And dipt again, with the young couple's weight, —</l>
            <l>Peona guiding, through the water straight,</l>
            <l>Towards a bowery island opposite;</l>
            <l>Which gaining presently, she steered light</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="115"/>
            <l>Where nested was an arbour, overwove</l>
            <l>By many a summer's silent fingering;</l>
            <l>To whose cool bosom she was used to bring</l>
            <l>Her playmates, with their needle broidery,</l>
            <l>And minstrel memories of times gone by.</l>
            <l>So she was gently glad to see him laid</l>
            <l>Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,</l>
            <l>On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,</l>
            <l>Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves</l>
            <l>When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,</l>
            <l>And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.</l>
            <l>Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest</l>
            <l>But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest</l>
            <l>Peona's busy hand against his lips,</l>
            <l>And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips</l>
            <l>In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps</l>
            <l>A patient watch over the stream that creeps</l>
            <l>Windingly by it, so the quiet maid</l>
            <l>Held her in peace   so that a whispering blade</l>
            <l>Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling</l>
            <l>Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling</l>
            <l>Among sere leaves and twigs, might all be heard.</l>
            <l>That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind</l>

            <l>Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,</l>
            <l>Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves</l>
            <l>And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world</l>
            <l>Of silvery enchantment!  — who, upfurl'd</l>
            <l>Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,</l>

            <l>Endymion was calm'd to life again.</l>
            <l>Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,</l>
            <l>He said   " I feel this thine endearing love</l>

            <l>From those kind eyes, — the very home and haunt</l>

            <l>Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?</l>
            <l>Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears</l>
            <l>Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise</l>
            <l>My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more</l>
            <l>Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar</l>
            <l>Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll</l>
            <l>Around the breathed boar:   again I'll poll</l>
            <l>The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow</l>
            <l>And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,</l>
            <l>Again I'll linger in a sloping mead</l>
            <l>To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed</l>
            <l>Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered, sweet,</l>
            <l>And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat</l>

            <l>Hereat Peona, in their silver source,</l>
            <l>Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,</l>
            <l>And took a lute, from which there pulsing came</l>
            <l>A lively prelude, fashioning the way</l>
            <l>In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay</l>
            <l>More subtle cadenced, more forest wild</l>
            <l>Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;</l>
            <l>And nothing since has floated in the air</l>
            <l>So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare</l>
            <l>Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;</l>
            <l>The quick invisible strings, even though she saw</l>

            <l>Before the deep intoxication.</l>
            <l>But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon</l>
            <l>Her self-possession — swung the lute aside,</l>
            <l>And earnestly said   " Brother, 'tis vain to hide</l>
            <l>That thou dost know of things mysterious,</l>
            <l>Immortal, starry; such alone could thus</l>
            <l>Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught</l>
            <l>Offensive to the heavenly powers?  caught</l>
            <l>A Paphian dove upon a message sent?</l>
            <l>Thy deathful bow against some dear-head bent,</l>
            <l>Sacred to Dian?  Haply, thou hast seen</l>
            <l>Her naked limbs among the alders green;</l>
            <l>And that, alas!  is death. No, I can trace</l>
            <l>Something more high-perplexing in thy face!"</l>
            <l>Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,</l>
            <l>And said, " Art thou so pale, who wast so bland</l>

            <l>Ah!  thou has been unhappy at the change</l>

            <l>No man e'er panted for a mortal love.</l>
            <l>So all have set my heavier grief above</l>
            <l>These things which happen. Rightly have they done</l>

            <l>So dear a picture of his sovereign power,</l>
            <l>And I could witness his most kingly hour,</l>
            <l>When he doth tighten up the golden reins,</l>
            <l>And paces leisurely down amber plains</l>
            <l>His snorting four. Now when his chariot last</l>
            <l>Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,</l>
            <l>There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed</l>
            <l>Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red</l>
            <l>At which I wondered greatly, knowing well</l>
            <l>That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;</l>
            <l>And, sitting down close by, began to muse</l>
            <l>What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,</l>
            <l>In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;</l>
            <l>Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook</l>
            <l>Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,</l>
            <l>Had dipt his rod in it   such garland wealth</l>
            <l>Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,</l>
            <l>Until my head was dizzy and distraught.</l>
            <l>Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole</l>
            <l>A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;</l>
            <l>And shaping visions all about my sight</l>
            <l>The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,</l>
            <l>And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim</l>
            <l>And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell</l>
            <l>The enchantment that afterwards befel?</l>
            <l>Yet it was but a dream   yet such a dream</l>

            <l>With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,</l>

            <l>All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay</l>
            <l>Watching the zenith, where the milky way</l>
            <l>Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;</l>
            <l>And travelling my eye, until the doors</l>
            <l>Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,</l>
            <l>I became loth and fearful to alight</l>
            <l>From such high soaring by a downward glance</l>
            <l>So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,</l>
            <l>Spreading imaginary pinions wide.</l>
            <l>When, presently, the stars began to glide,</l>
            <l>And faint away, before my eager view</l>
            <l>At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,</l>
            <l>And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;</l>
            <l>And lo!  from the opening clouds, I saw emerge</l>

            <l>So passionately bright, my dazzled soul</l>
            <l>Commingling with her argent spheres did roll</l>
            <l>Through clear and cloudy, even when she went</l>

            <l>Whence that completed form of all completeness?</l>

            <l>The wooing arms which held me, and did give</l>
            <l>My eyes at once to death   but 'twas to live,</l>
            <l>To take in draughts of life from the gold fount</l>

            <l>Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store</l>

            <l>I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed</l>

            <l>Bear up against it   so farewel, sad sigh;</l>
            <l>And come instead demurest meditation,</l>
            <l>To occupy me wholly, and to fashion</l>
            <l>My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.</l>
            <l>No more will I count over, link by link,</l>
            <l>My chain of grief   no longer strive to find</l>
            <l>A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind</l>
            <l>Blustering about my ears   aye, thou shalt see,</l>
            <l>Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;</l>
            <l>What a calm round of hours shall make my days.</l>

            <l>There is a paly flame of hope that plays</l>
            <l>Where'er I look   but yet, I'll say 'tis naught —</l>
            <l>And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,</l>
            <l>Already, a more healthy countenance?</l>
            <l>Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car."</l>
            <l>This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star</l>
            <l>Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand</l>
            <l>They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.</l>

            <l>All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,</l>
            <l>And shadowy, through the mist of passed years</l>
            <l>For others, good or bad, hatred and tears</l>
            <l>Have become indolent; but touching thine,</l>
            <l>One sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,</l>
            <l>One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.</l>
            <l>The woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,</l>
            <l>Stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,</l>
            <l>Struggling, and blood, and shrieks — all dimly fades</l>
            <l>Into some backward corner of the brain;</l>
            <l>Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain</l>
            <l>The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.</l>
            <l>Hence, pageant history!  hence, gilded cheat!</l>
            <l>Swart planet in the universe of deeds!</l>
            <l>Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds</l>
            <l>Along the pebbled shore of memory!</l>
            <l>Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified</l>
            <l>To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,</l>
            <l>And golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="133"/>
            <l>But wherefore this?  what care, though owl did fly</l>
            <l>About the great Athenian admiral's mast?</l>
            <l>What care, though striding Alexander past</l>
            <l>The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?</l>
            <l>Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers</l>
            <l>The glutted Cyclops, what care?  — Juliet leaning</l>

            <l>Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,</l>
            <l>Doth more avail than these   the silver flow</l>
            <l>Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,</l>
            <l>Fair Pastorella in the bandit's den,</l>
            <l>Are things to brood on with more ardency</l>
            <l>Than the death-day of empires. Fearfully</l>
            <l>Must such conviction come upon his head,</l>
            <l>Who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,</l>
            <l>Without one muse's smile, or kind behest,</l>

            <l>In chafing restlessness, is yet more drear</l>
            <l>Than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear</l>
            <l>So once more days and nights aid me along,</l>
            <l>Like legion'd soldiers. Brain-sick shepherd-prince,</l>
            <l>What promise hast thou faithful guarded since</l>

            <l>Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;</l>
            <l>Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes</l>
            <l>Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,</l>

            <l>Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.</l>

            <l>And elbow-deep with feverous fingering</l>
            <l>Stems the upbursting cold   a wild rose tree</l>
            <l>Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see</l>
            <l>A bud which snares his fancy   lo!  but now</l>
            <l>He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water   how!</l>
            <l>It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;</l>
            <l>And, in the middle, there is softly pight</l>
            <l>A golden butterfly; upon whose wings</l>
            <l>There must be surely character'd strange things,</l>
            <l>For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.</l>
            <l>Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands</l>
            <l>Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands</l>
            <l>His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies</l>
            <l>Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.</l>
            <l>It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;</l>
            <l>And like a new-born spirit did he pass</l>
            <l>Through the green evening quiet in the sun,</l>
            <l>O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,</l>
            <l>Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams</l>
            <l>The summer time away. One track unseams</l>
            <l>A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue</l>
            <l>Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,</l>
            <l>He sinks adown a solitary glen,</l>
            <l>Where there was never sound of mortal men,</l>
            <l>Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences</l>
            <l>Melting to silence, when upon the breeze</l>
            <l>Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,</l>
            <l>To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet</l>
            <l>Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="135"/>
            <l>Until it reached a splashing fountain's side</l>
            <l>That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd</l>
            <l>Unto the temperate air   then high it soar'd,</l>
            <l>As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip</l>
            <l>The crystal spout-head   so it did, with touch</l>
            <l>Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch</l>
            <l>Even with mealy gold the waters clear.</l>
            <l>But, at that very touch, to disappear</l>
            <l>So fairy-quick, was strange!  Bewildered,</l>
            <l>Endymion sought around, and shook each bed</l>
            <l>Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung</l>
            <l>Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,</l>
            <l>What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?</l>
            <l>It was a nymph uprisen to the breast</l>
            <l>In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood</l>
            <l>'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.</l>
            <l>To him her dripping hand she softly kist,</l>
            <l>And anxiously began to plait and twist</l>
            <l>Her ringlets round her fingers, saying   " Youth!</l>
            <l>Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,</l>
            <l>The bitterness of love   too long indeed,</l>

            <l>Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer</l>
            <l>All the bright riches of my crystal coffer</l>

            <l>Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands</l>
            <l>By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,</l>

            <l>Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup</l>
            <l>Meander gave me, — for I bubbled up</l>

            <l>The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool</l>
            <l>Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,</l>
            <l>And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill</l>
            <l>Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,</l>
            <l>Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr</l>
            <l>Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;</l>
            <l>And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown</l>
            <l>Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,</l>

            <l>O what a wretch is he!  and when 'tis his,</l>
            <l>After long toil and travelling, to miss</l>
            <l>The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile</l>
            <l>Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;</l>

            <l>When mad Eurydice is listening to 't;</l>

            <l>Endymion feels it, and no more controls</l>
            <l>The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,</l>
            <l>He had begun a plaining of his woe.</l>

            <l>With love — he — but alas!  too well I see</l>

            <l>Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,</l>

            <l>Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;</l>
            <l>Those same full fringed lids a constant blind</l>
            <l>Over his sullen eyes   I saw him throw</l>
            <l>Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though</l>
            <l>Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,</l>
            <l>Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd</l>
            <l>Some fair immortal, and that his embrace</l>
            <l>Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace</l>
            <l>Of this in heaven   I have mark'd each cheek,</l>
            <l>And find it is the vainest thing to seek;</l>

            <l>And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.</l>
            <l>Endymion!  one day thou wilt be blest</l>
            <l>So still obey the guiding hand that fends</l>
            <l>Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.</l>
            <l>And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam</l>
            <l>Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!</l>
            <l>Here must we leave thee. "  — At these words up flew</l>
            <l>The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,</l>
            <l>Up went the hum celestial. High afar</l>
            <l>The Latmian saw them minish into nought;</l>
            <l>And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught</l>
            <l>A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.</l>
            <l>When all was darkened, with Etnean throe</l>
            <l>The earth clos'd — gave a solitary moan —</l>
            <l>And left him once again in twilight lone.</l>

            <l>Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells</l>

            <l>So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd</l>
            <l>Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd</l>
            <l>With airs delicious. In the greenest nook</l>
            <l>It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown</l>

            <l>Silence was music from the holy spheres;</l>
            <l>A dewy luxury was in his eyes;</l>
            <l>The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs</l>

            <milestone unit="page" n="158"/>
            <l>By a cavern wind unto a forest old;</l>
            <l>To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam</l>
            <l>A poet caught as he was journeying</l>
            <l>To Phoebus' shrine; and in it he did fling</l>
            <l>His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,</l>
            <l>And, after straight, in that inspired place</l>
            <l>He sang the story up into the air,</l>
            <l>Giving it universal freedom. There</l>
            <l>Has it been ever sounding for those ears</l>
            <l>Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers</l>
            <l>Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it</l>
            <l>Must surely be self-doom'd or he will rue it</l>
            <l>For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,</l>
            <l>Made fiercer by a fear lest any part</l>
            <l>Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.</l>
            <l>As much as here is penn'd doth always find</l>

            <l>And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,</l>
            <l>That the fair visitant at last unwound</l>
            <l>Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep. —</l>

            <l>Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love</l>
            <l>Henceforth was dove-like. — Loth was he to move</l>
            <l>From the imprinted couch, and when he did,</l>
            <l>'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid</l>
            <l>In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd</l>
            <l>Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd</l>
            <l>Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen</l>
            <l>Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean</l>
            <l>Over eclipsing eyes   and at the last</l>
            <l>It was a sounding grotto, vaulted vast,</l>
            <l>And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,</l>
            <l>Of every shape and size, even to the bulk</l>
            <l>In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk</l>
            <l>Against an endless storm. Moreover too,</l>
            <l>Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,</l>
            <l>Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder</l>
            <l>Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder</l>
            <l>On all his life   his youth, up to the day</l>
            <l>When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,</l>
            <l>He stept upon his shepherd throne   the look</l>
            <l>Of his white palace in wild forest nook,</l>
            <l>And all the revels he had lorded there</l>
            <l>Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,</l>
            <l>With every friend and fellow-woodlander —</l>

            <l>He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone</l>
            <l>Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,</l>
            <l>On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,</l>
            <l>A copious spring; and both together dash'd</l>
            <l>Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd</l>
            <l>Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,</l>
            <l>Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot</l>
            <l>Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise</l>
            <l>As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize</l>

            <l>Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude</l>

            <l>Quicksand, and whirlpool, and deserted shore</l>

            <l>One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff</l>

            <l>Forgetful utterly of self-intent;</l>
            <l>Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.</l>
            <l>Then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew</l>
            <l>His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,</l>
            <l>I tried in fear the pinions of my will.</l>

            <l>She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,</l>
            <l>Round every isle, and point, and promontory,</l>
            <l>From where large Hercules wound up his story</l>
            <l>Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew</l>

            <l>And in that agony, across my grief</l>
            <l>It flash'd, that Circe might find some relief —</l>
            <l>Cruel enchantress!  So above the water</l>
            <l>I rear'd my head, and look'd for Phoebus' daughter.</l>
            <l>Aeaea's isle was wondering at the moon   —</l>

            <l>With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove</l>
            <l>A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all</l>
            <l>The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall</l>
            <l>The dew of her rich speech   " Ah!  Art awake?</l>

            <l>The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls</l>
            <l>I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.</l>

            <l>Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit</l>
            <l>Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,</l>
            <l>By one and one, to pale oblivion;</l>
            <l>And I was gazing on the surges prone,</l>
            <l>With many a scalding tear and many a groan,</l>
            <l>When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,</l>

            <l>To usher back his spirit into life</l>
            <l>But still he slept. At last they interwove</l>
            <l>Their cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey</l>

            <l>Thee to thy native hopes. O thou hast won</l>
            <l>A full accomplishment!  The thing is done,</l>

            <l>Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.</l>
            <l>Long have I said, how happy he who shrives</l>

            <l>Cold as my fears.</l>
            <l>"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,</l>
            <l>I sat aweeping   what enamour'd bride,</l>
            <l>Cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds,</l>
            <l>But hides and shrouds</l>
            <l>Beneath dark palm trees by a river side?</l>
            <l>"And as I sat, over the light blue hills</l>
            <l>There came a noise of revellers   the rills</l>

            <l>The earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills</l>
            <l>'Twas Bacchus and his kin!</l>
            <l>Like to a moving vintage down they came,</l>
            <l>Crown'd with green leaves, and faces all on flame;</l>
            <l>All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,</l>
            <l>To scare thee, Melancholy!</l>
            <l>O then, o then, thou wast a simple name!</l>
            <l>And I forgot thee, as the berried holly</l>

            <l>Tall chesnuts keep away the sun and moon   —</l>

            <l>For Venus' pearly bite</l>
            <l>And near him rode Silenus on his ass,</l>

            <l>Like one repenting in his latest moan;</l>
            <l>And while it died away a shade pass'd by,</l>

            <l>One moment from his home   only the sward</l>

            <l>Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,</l>
            <l>But at the setting I must bid adieu</l>
            <l>To her for the last time. Night will strew</l>

            <l>To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.</l>

            <l>Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display</l>
            <l>Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day</l>
            <l>Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld</l>

            <l>Her lucid bow, continuing thus; " Drear, drear</l>

            <l>Thy latent talons in me — and upraise</l>
            <l>Thy gentle mew — and tell me all thy frays</l>
            <l>Of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick.</l>
            <l>Nay look not down, nor lick thy dainty wrists —</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="223"/>
            <l>Thy tail's tip is nicked off — and though the fists</l>
            <l>Of many a maid have given thee many a maul,</l>
            <l>Still is that fur as soft as when the lists</l>
            <l>In youth thou enter'dst on glass-bottled wall.</l>

            <l>Part of the building was a chosen see</l>
            <l>Built by a banish'd santon of Chaldee</l>
            <l>The other part two thousand years from him</l>
            <l>Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim;</l>
            <l>Then there's a little wing, far from the sun,</l>
            <l>Built by a Lapland witch turn'd maudlin nun —</l>
            <l>And many other juts of aged stone</l>
            <l>Founded with many a mason-devil's groan.</l>

            <l>The windows as if latch'd by fays and elves —</l>

            <milestone unit="page" n="243"/>
            <l>As from the westward of a summer's night;</l>
            <l>Or like a beauteous woman's large blue eyes</l>
            <l>Gone mad through olden songs and poesies —</l>
            <l>See what is coming from the distance dim!</l>
            <l>A golden galley all in silken trim!</l>
            <l>Three rows of oars are lightening moment-whiles</l>
            <l>Into the verdurous bosoms of those isles.</l>
            <l>Towards the shade under the castle wall</l>
            <l>It comes in silence — now tis hidden all.</l>
            <l>The clarion sounds; and from a postern grate</l>
            <l>An echo of sweet music doth create</l>
            <l>A fear in the poor herdsman who doth bring</l>
            <l>His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring</l>
            <l>He tells of the sweet music and the spot</l>
            <l>To all his friends, and they believe him not.</l>
            <l>O that our dreamings all of sleep or wake</l>

            <l>From something of material sublime,</l>
            <l>Rather than shadow our own soul's daytime</l>
            <l>In the dark void of night. For in the world</l>
            <l>We jostle — but my flag is not unfurl'd</l>
            <l>On the admiral staff — and to philosophize</l>
            <l>I dare not yet!  — Oh never will the prize,</l>
            <l>High reason, and the lore of good and ill</l>
            <l>Be my award. Things cannot to the will</l>
            <l>Be settled, but they tease us out of thought.</l>
            <l>Or is it that imagination brought</l>
            <l>Beyond its proper bound, yet still confined, —</l>
            <l>Lost in a sort of purgatory blind,</l>
            <l>Cannot refer to any standard law</l>
            <l>Of either earth or heaven?   — It is a flaw</l>
            <l>In happiness to see beyond our bourn —</l>
            <l>It spoils the singing of the nightingale.</l>
            <l>Dear Reynolds, I have a mysterious tale</l>
            <l>And cannot speak it. The first page I read</l>
            <l>Upon a lampit rock of green sea weed</l>
            <l>Among the breakers — 'Twas a quiet eve;</l>
            <l>The rocks were silent — the wide sea did weave</l>
            <l>An untumultuous fringe of silver foam</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="244"/>
            <l>Along the flat brown sand. I was at home,</l>
            <l>And should have been most happy — but I saw</l>
            <l>Too far into the sea; where every maw</l>
            <l>The greater on the less feeds evermore   —</l>
            <l>But I saw too distinct into the core</l>
            <l>Of an eternal fierce destruction,</l>
            <l>And so from happiness I far was gone.</l>
            <l>Still am I sick of it   and though to-day</l>
            <l>I've gathered young spring-leaves, and flowers gay</l>
            <l>Of periwinkle and wild strawberry,</l>
            <l>Still do I that most fierce destruction see,</l>
            <l>The shark at savage prey — the hawk at pounce,</l>
            <l>The gentle robin, like a pard or ounce,</l>
            <l>Ravening a worm — Away ye horrid moods,</l>
            <l>Moods of one's mind!  you know I hate them well,</l>
            <l>You know I'd sooner be a clapping bell</l>
            <l>To some Kamschatkan missionary church,</l>
            <l>Than with these horrid moods be left in lurch —</l>
            <l>Do you get health — and Tom the same — I'll dance,</l>
            <l>And from detested moods in new romance</l>
            <l>Take refuge — Of bad lines a centaine dose</l>

            <head>Isabella; or, The Pot of Basil</head>
            <l>Fair Isabel, poor simple Isabel!</l>
            <l>Lorenzo, a young palmer in Love's eye!</l>
            <l>They could not in the self-same mansion dwell</l>
            <l>Without some stir of heart, some malady;</l>
            <l>They could not sit at meals but feel how well</l>
            <l>It soothed each to be the other by;</l>
            <l>They could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep</l>
            <l>But to each other dream, and nightly weep.</l>
            <l>With every morn their love grew tenderer,</l>
            <l>With every eve deeper and tenderer still;</l>
            <l>He might not in house, field, or garden stir,</l>
            <l>But her full shape would all his seeing fill;</l>
            <l>And his continual voice was pleasanter</l>
            <l>To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;</l>
            <l>Her lute-string gave an echo of his name,</l>
            <l>She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.</l>
            <l>He knew whose gentle hand was at the latch,</l>
            <l>Before the door had given her to his eyes;</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="246"/>
            <l>And from her chamber-window he would catch</l>
            <l>Her beauty farther than the falcon spies;</l>
            <l>And constant as her vespers would he watch,</l>
            <l>Because her face was turn'd to the same skies;</l>
            <l>And with sick longing all the night outwear,</l>
            <l>To hear her morning-step upon the stair.</l>
            <l>A whole long month of May in this sad plight</l>
            <l>Made their cheeks paler by the break of June</l>
            <l>"To-morrow will I bow to my delight,</l>
            <l>To-morrow will I ask my lady's boon. " —</l>
            <l>"O may I never see another night,</l>
            <l>Lorenzo, if thy lips breathe not love's tune. "  —</l>
            <l>So spake they to their pillows; but, alas,</l>
            <l>Honeyless days and days did he let pass;</l>
            <l>Until sweet Isabella's untouch'd cheek</l>
            <l>Fell sick within the rose's just domain,</l>
            <l>Fell thin as a young mother's, who doth seek</l>
            <l>By every lull to cool her infant's pain</l>
            <l>"How ill she is, " said he, " I may not speak,</l>

            <l>If looks speak love-laws, I will drink her tears,</l>
            <l>And at the least 'twill startle off her cares."</l>
            <l>His heart beat awfully against his side;</l>
            <l>And to his heart he inwardly did pray</l>
            <l>For power to speak; but still the ruddy tide</l>
            <l>Stifled his voice, and puls'd resolve away —</l>
            <l>Fever'd his high conceit of such a bride,</l>

            <l>Yet brought him to the meekness of a child</l>
            <l>Alas!  when passion is both meek and wild!</l>
            <l>So once more he had wak'd and anguished</l>
            <l>A dreary night of love and misery,</l>
            <l>If Isabel's quick eye had not been wed</l>
            <l>To every symbol on his forehead high;</l>
            <l>She saw it waxing very pale and dead,</l>
            <l>And straight all flush'd; so, lisped tenderly,</l>
            <l>"Lorenzo! "  — here she ceas'd her timid quest,</l>
            <l>But in her tone and look he read the rest.</l>
            <l>"O Isabella, I can half perceive</l>
            <l>That I may speak my grief into thine ear;</l>
            <l>If thou didst ever any thing believe,</l>
            <l>Believe how I love thee, believe how near</l>
            <l>My soul is to its doom   I would not grieve</l>
            <l>Thy hand by unwelcome pressing, would not fear</l>
            <l>Thine eyes by gazing; but I cannot live</l>
            <l>Another night, and not my passion shrive.</l>
            <l>Love!  thou art leading me from wintry cold,</l>
            <l>Lady!  thou leadest me to summer clime,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="248"/>
            <l>And I must taste the blossoms that unfold</l>
            <l>In its ripe warmth this gracious morning time."</l>
            <l>So said, his erewhile timid lips grew bold,</l>
            <l>And poesied with hers in dewy rhyme</l>
            <l>Great bliss was with them, and great happiness</l>
            <l>Grew, like a lusty flower in June's caress.</l>
            <l>Parting they seem'd to tread upon the air,</l>
            <l>Twin roses by the zephyr blown apart</l>
            <l>Only to meet again more close, and share</l>
            <l>The inward fragrance of each other's heart.</l>
            <l>She, to her chamber gone, a ditty fair</l>
            <l>Sang, of delicious love and honey'd dart;</l>
            <l>He with light steps went up a western hill,</l>
            <l>And bade the sun farewell, and joy'd his fill.</l>
            <l>All close they met again, before the dusk</l>
            <l>Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil,</l>
            <l>All close they met, all eves, before the dusk</l>
            <l>Close in a bower of hyacinth and musk,</l>
            <l>Unknown of any, free from whispering tale.</l>
            <l>Ah!  better had it been for ever so,</l>
            <l>Than idle ears should pleasure in their woe.</l>
            <l>Were they unhappy then?  — it cannot be —</l>
            <l>Too many tears for lovers have been shed,</l>
            <l>Too many sighs give we to them in fee,</l>
            <l>Too much of pity after they are dead,</l>
            <l>Too many doleful stories do we see,</l>
            <l>Whose matter in bright gold were best be read;</l>
            <l>Except in such a page where Theseus' spouse</l>

            <l>But, for the general award of love,</l>
            <l>The little sweet doth kill much bitterness;</l>
            <l>Though Dido silent is in under-grove,</l>
            <l>And Isabella's was a great distress,</l>
            <l>Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove</l>
            <l>Was not embalm'd, this truth is not the less</l>
            <l>Even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers,</l>
            <l>Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers.</l>
            <l>With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt,</l>
            <l>Enriched from ancestral merchandize,</l>
            <l>And for them many a weary hand did swelt</l>
            <l>In torched mines and noisy factories,</l>
            <l>And many once proud-quiver'd loins did melt</l>
            <l>In blood from stinging whip; — with hollow eyes</l>
            <l>Many all day in dazzling river stood,</l>
            <l>To take the rich-ored driftings of the flood.</l>
            <l>For them the Ceylon diver held his breath,</l>

            <l>For them his ears gush'd blood; for them in death</l>
            <l>The seal on the cold ice with piteous bark</l>

            <l>A thousand men in troubles wide and dark</l>
            <l>Half-ignorant, they turn'd an easy wheel,</l>

            <l>Why were they proud?  Because their marble founts</l>

            <l>And went in haste, to get in readiness,</l>
            <l>With belt, and spur, and bracing huntsman's dress.</l>
            <l>And as he to the court-yard pass'd along,</l>
            <l>Each third step did he pause, and listen'd oft</l>
            <l>If he could hear his lady's matin-song,</l>
            <l>Or the light whisper of her footstep soft;</l>
            <l>And as he thus over his passion hung,</l>
            <l>He heard a laugh full musical aloft;</l>
            <l>When, looking up, he saw her features bright</l>
            <l>Smile through an in-door lattice, all delight.</l>
            <l>"Love, Isabel! "  said he, " I was in pain</l>
            <l>Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow</l>
            <l>Ah!  what if I should lose thee, when so fain</l>
            <l>I am to stifle all the heavy sorrow</l>
            <l>Of a poor three hours' absence?  but we'll gain</l>
            <l>Out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow.</l>
            <l>Good bye!  I'll soon be back. "  — " Good bye! "  said she   —</l>
            <l>And as he went she chanted merrily.</l>
            <l>So the two brothers and their murder'd man</l>
            <l>Rode past fair Florence, to where Arno's stream</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="253"/>
            <l>Itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream</l>
            <l>Keeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan</l>
            <l>The brothers' faces in the ford did seem,</l>
            <l>Lorenzo's flush with love. — They pass'd the water</l>
            <l>Into a forest quiet for the slaughter.</l>
            <l>There was Lorenzo slain and buried in,</l>
            <l>There in that forest did his great love cease;</l>
            <l>Ah!  when a soul doth thus its freedom win,</l>
            <l>It aches in loneliness — is ill at peace</l>
            <l>As the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin</l>
            <l>They dipp'd their swords in the water, and did tease</l>
            <l>Their horses homeward, with convulsed spur,</l>
            <l>Each richer by his being a murderer.</l>
            <l>They told their sister how, with sudden speed,</l>
            <l>Lorenzo had ta'en ship for foreign lands,</l>
            <l>Because of some great urgency and need</l>
            <l>In their affairs, requiring trusty hands.</l>
            <l>Poor Girl!  put on thy stifling widow's weed,</l>
            <l>And 'scape at once from Hope's accursed bands;</l>
            <l>To-day thou wilt not see him, nor to-morrow,</l>
            <l>And the next day will be a day of sorrow.</l>
            <l>She weeps alone for pleasures not to be;</l>
            <l>Sorely she wept until the night came on,</l>
            <l>And then, instead of love, O misery!</l>
            <l>She brooded o'er the luxury alone</l>
            <l>His image in the dusk she seem'd to see,</l>
            <l>And to the silence made a gentle moan,</l>
            <l>Spreading her perfect arms upon the air,</l>
            <l>And on her couch low murmuring " Where?  O where?"</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="254"/>
            <l>But Selfishness, Love's cousin, held not long</l>
            <l>Its fiery vigil in her single breast;</l>
            <l>She fretted for the golden hour, and hung</l>
            <l>Upon the time with feverish unrest —</l>
            <l>Not long — for soon into her heart a throng</l>
            <l>Of higher occupants, a richer zest,</l>
            <l>Came tragic; passion not to be subdued,</l>
            <l>And sorrow for her love in travels rude.</l>
            <l>In the mid days of autumn, on their eves,</l>
            <l>The breath of Winter comes from far away,</l>
            <l>And the sick west continually bereaves</l>
            <l>Of some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay</l>
            <l>Of death among the bushes and the leaves</l>
            <l>From his north cavern. So sweet Isabel</l>
            <l>By gradual decay from beauty fell,</l>
            <l>Because Lorenzo came not. Oftentimes</l>
            <l>She ask'd her brothers, with an eye all pale,</l>
            <l>Striving to be itself, what dungeon climes</l>
            <l>Could keep him off so long?  They spake a tale</l>
            <l>Time after time, to quiet her. Their crimes</l>
            <l>Came on them, like a smoke from Hinnom's vale;</l>
            <l>And every night in dreams they groan'd aloud,</l>
            <l>To see their sister in her snowy shroud.</l>
            <l>And she had died in drowsy ignorance,</l>
            <l>But for a thing more deadly dark than all;</l>
            <l>It came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="255"/>
            <l>Which saves a sick man from the feather'd pall</l>
            <l>For some few gasping moments; like a lance,</l>
            <l>Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall</l>
            <l>With cruel pierce, and bringing him again</l>
            <l>Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.</l>
            <l>It was a vision. — In the drowsy gloom,</l>
            <l>The dull of midnight, at her couch's foot</l>
            <l>Lorenzo stood, and wept   the forest tomb</l>
            <l>Had marr'd his glossy hair which once could shoot</l>
            <l>Lustre into the sun, and put cold doom</l>
            <l>Upon his lips, and taken the soft lute</l>
            <l>From his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears</l>
            <l>Had made a miry channel for his tears.</l>
            <l>Strange sound it was, when the pale shadow spake;</l>
            <l>For there was striving, in its piteous tongue,</l>
            <l>To speak as when on earth it was awake,</l>
            <l>And Isabella on its music hung</l>
            <l>Languor there was in it, and tremulous shake,</l>
            <l>As in a palsied Druid's harp unstrung;</l>
            <l>And through it moan'd a ghostly under-song,</l>
            <l>Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.</l>
            <l>Its eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright</l>
            <l>With love, and kept all phantom fear aloof</l>
            <l>From the poor girl by magic of their light,</l>
            <l>The while it did unthread the horrid woof</l>
            <l>Of the late darken'd time, — the murderous spite</l>
            <l>Of pride and avarice, — the dark pine roof</l>

            <l>In the forest, — and the sodden turfed dell,</l>

            <l>The Spirit mourn'd " Adieu! "  — dissolv'd, and left</l>
            <l>The atom darkness in a slow turmoil;</l>
            <l>As when of healthful midnight sleep bereft,</l>
            <l>Thinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil,</l>
            <l>We put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,</l>

            <l>Resolv'd, she took with her an aged nurse,</l>

            <milestone unit="page" n="258"/>
            <l>And they had found Lorenzo's earthy bed;</l>
            <l>The flint was there, the berries at his head.</l>
            <l>Who hath not loiter'd in a green church-yard,</l>
            <l>And let his spirit, like a demon-mole,</l>
            <l>Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,</l>
            <l>To see scull, coffin'd bones, and funeral stole;</l>
            <l>Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marr'd,</l>
            <l>And filling it once more with human soul?</l>
            <l>Ah!  this is holiday to what was felt</l>
            <l>When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt.</l>
            <l>She gaz'd into the fresh-thrown mould, as though</l>
            <l>One glance did fully all its secrets tell;</l>
            <l>Clearly she saw, as other eyes would know</l>
            <l>Pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well;</l>
            <l>Upon the murderous spot she seem'd to grow,</l>
            <l>Like to a native lily of the dell</l>
            <l>Then with her knife, all sudden, she began</l>
            <l>To dig more fervently than misers can.</l>
            <l>Soon she turn'd up a soiled glove, whereon</l>
            <l>Her silk had play'd in purple phantasies,</l>
            <l>She kiss'd it with a lip more chill than stone,</l>
            <l>And put it in her bosom, where it dries</l>
            <l>And freezes utterly unto the bone</l>
            <l>Those dainties made to still an infant's cries</l>
            <l>Then 'gan she work again; nor stay'd her care,</l>
            <l>But to throw back at times her veiling hair.</l>
            <l>That old nurse stood beside her wondering,</l>
            <l>Until her heart felt pity to the core</l>
            <l>At sight of such a dismal labouring,</l>
            <l>And so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar,</l>
            <l>And put her lean hands to the horrid thing</l>
            <l>Three hours they labour'd at this travail sore;</l>
            <l>At last they felt the kernel of the grave,</l>
            <l>And Isabella did not stamp and rave.</l>
            <l>Ah!  wherefore all this wormy circumstance?</l>
            <l>Why linger at the yawning tomb so long?</l>
            <l>O for the gentleness of old Romance,</l>
            <l>The simple plaining of a minstrel's song!</l>
            <l>Fair reader, at the old tale take a glance,</l>
            <l>For here, in truth, it doth not well belong</l>
            <l>To speak   — O turn thee to the very tale,</l>
            <l>And taste the music of that vision pale.</l>
            <l>With duller steel than the Persean sword</l>
            <l>They cut away no formless monster's head,</l>
            <l>But one, whose gentleness did well accord</l>
            <l>With death, as life. The ancient harps have said,</l>
            <l>Love never dies, but lives, immortal Lord</l>
            <l>If Love impersonate was ever dead,</l>
            <l>Pale Isabella kiss'd it, and low moan'd.</l>
            <l>'Twas love; cold, — dead indeed, but not dethroned.</l>
            <l>In anxious secrecy they took it home,</l>
            <l>And then the prize was all for Isabel</l>
            <l>She calm'd its wild hair with a golden comb,</l>
            <l>And all around each eye's sepulchral cell</l>
            <l>Pointed each fringed lash; the smeared loam</l>
            <l>With tears, as chilly as a dripping well,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="260"/>
            <l>She drench'd away   — and still she comb'd, and kept</l>
            <l>Sighing all day — and still she kiss'd, and wept.</l>
            <l>Then in a silken scarf, — sweet with the dews</l>
            <l>Of precious flowers pluck'd in Araby,</l>
            <l>And divine liquids come with odorous ooze</l>
            <l>Through the cold serpent-pipe refreshfully, —</l>
            <l>She wrapp'd it up; and for its tomb did choose</l>
            <l>A garden-pot, wherein she laid it by,</l>
            <l>And cover'd it with mould, and o'er it set</l>
            <l>Sweet basil, which her tears kept ever wet.</l>
            <l>And she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun,</l>
            <l>And she forgot the blue above the trees,</l>
            <l>And she forgot the dells where waters run,</l>
            <l>And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;</l>
            <l>She had no knowledge when the day was done,</l>
            <l>Hung over her sweet basil evermore,</l>
            <l>And moisten'd it with tears unto the core.</l>
            <l>And so she ever fed it with thin tears,</l>
            <l>Whence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew,</l>
            <l>So that it smelt more balmy than its peers</l>
            <l>Of basil-tufts in Florence; for it drew</l>
            <l>Nurture besides, and life, from human fears,</l>
            <l>From the fast mouldering head there shut from view</l>
            <l>So that the jewel, safely casketed,</l>
            <l>Came forth, and in perfumed leafits spread.</l>
            <l>O Melancholy, linger here awhile!</l>

            <l>And, patient as a hen-bird, sat her there</l>
            <l>Beside her basil, weeping through her hair.</l>
            <l>Yet they contriv'd to steal the basil-pot,</l>

            <l>The thing was vile with green and livid spot,</l>
            <l>And yet they knew it was Lorenzo's face</l>
            <l>The guerdon of their murder they had got,</l>
            <l>And so left Florence in a moment's space,</l>
            <l>Never to turn again. — Away they went,</l>
            <l>With blood upon their heads, to banishment.</l>

            <l>Piteous she look'd on dead and senseless things,</l>
            <l>Asking for her lost basil amorously;</l>
            <l>And with melodious chuckle in the strings</l>
            <l>Of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry</l>
            <l>After the pilgrim in his wanderings,</l>
            <l>To ask him where her basil was; and why</l>
            <l>Twas hid from her   " For cruel 'tis, " said she,</l>
            <l>"To steal my basil-pot away from me."</l>
            <l>And so she pined, and so she died forlorn,</l>
            <l>Imploring for her basil to the last.</l>
            <l>No heart was there in Florence but did mourn</l>
            <l>In pity of her love, so overcast.</l>
            <l>And a sad ditty of this story born</l>
            <l>From mouth to mouth through all the country pass'd</l>
            <l>Still is the burthen sung — " O cruelty,</l>
            <l>"To steal my basil-pot away from me!"</l>

            <l>Sleep in the lap of thunder or sunbeams,</l>
            <l>Or when grey clouds are thy cold coverlid?</l>
            <l>Thou answer'st not; for thou art dead asleep;</l>
            <l>Thy life is but two dead eternities —</l>
            <l>The last in air, the former in the deep;</l>

            <l>Nev. A vein of sulphur — go dear Red-Crag-, go —</l>
            <l>Nev. And rub your flinty back against it — budge!</l>
            <l>Nev. Dear madam, I must kiss you, faith I must!</l>

            <l>Nev. Block-head, d'ye hear — Block-head, I'll make her feel —</l>
            <l>Nev. There lies beneath my east leg's northern heel</l>
            <l>Nev. A cave of young earth-dragons — well, my boy,</l>
            <l>Nev. Go thither quick and so complete my joy</l>
            <l>Nev. Take you a bundle of the largest pines</l>
            <l>Nev. And where the sun on fiercest phosphor shines</l>
            <l>Nev. Fire them and ram them in the dragons' nest,</l>
            <l>Nev. Then will the dragons fry and fizz their best</l>
            <l>Nev. Until ten thousand now no bigger than</l>
            <l>Nev. Poor alligators — poor things of one span —</l>
            <l>Nev. Will each one swell to twice ten times the size</l>
            <l>Nev. Of northern whale — then for the tender prize —</l>
            <l>Nev. The moment then — for then will Red-Crag- rob</l>
            <l>Nev. His flinty back — and I shall kiss and snub</l>
            <l>Nev. And press my dainty morsel to my breast.</l>
            <l>Nev. Block-head, make haste!  O Muses weep the rest —</l>
            <l>Nev. The lady fainted and he thought her dead</l>
            <l>Nev. So pulled the clouds again about his head</l>
            <l>Nev. And went to sleep again — soon she was rous'd</l>
            <l>Nev. By her affrighted servants — next day hous'd</l>
            <l>Nev. That fainting fit was not delayed too late.</l>

            <l>Nature withheld cassandra in the skies,</l>
            <l>For more adornment, a full thousand years;</l>
            <l>She took their cream of beauty's fairest dyes,</l>
            <l>And shap'd and tinted her above all peers</l>
            <l>Meanwhile love kept her dearly with his wings,</l>
            <l>And underneath their shadow fill'd her eyes</l>
            <l>With such a richness that the cloudy kings</l>
            <l>Of high olympus utter'd slavish sighs.</l>
            <l>When from the heavens I saw her first descend,</l>
            <l>My heart took fire, and only burning pains,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="286"/>
            <l>They were my pleasures — they my life's sad end;</l>
            <l>Love pour'd her beauty into my warm veins . . .</l>
            <l>Cb. In short, Convince you that however wise</l>
            <l>Cb. You may have grown from convent libraries,</l>
            <l>Cb. I have, by many yards at least, been carding</l>
            <l>A longer skein of wit in Convent Garden.</l>
            <l>Ber. A very Eden that same place must be!</l>

            <l>Ber. What, have you convents in that Gothic isle?</l>
            <l>Ber. Pray pardon me, I cannot help but smile.</l>
            <l>Cb. Sir, Convent Garden is a monstrous beast</l>
            <l>Cb. From morning, four o'clock, to twelve at noon,</l>
            <l>Cb. It swallows cabbages without a spoon,</l>
            <l>Cb. And then, from 12 till two, this Eden made is</l>
            <l>Cb. A promenade for cooks and ancient ladies;</l>
            <l>Cb. It swallows chairmen, damns, and hackney coaches.</l>
            <l>Cb. In short, sir, 'tis a very place for monks,</l>
            <l>Cb. For it containeth twenty thousand punks,</l>
            <l>Cb. Which any man may number for his sport,</l>
            <l>Cb. By following fat elbows up a court.</l>
            <l>Cb. In such like nonsense would I pass an hour</l>
            <l>Cb. With random friar, or rake upon his tour,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="287"/>
            <l>Cb. Or one of few of that imperial host</l>
            <l>Cb. Who came unmaimed from the Russian frost.</l>
            <l>Cb. To-night I'll have my friar — let me think</l>
            <l>Cb. About my room, — I'll have it in the pink;</l>
            <l>Cb. It should be rich and sombre, and the moon,</l>
            <l>Cb. Just in its mid-life in the midst of June,</l>
            <l>Cb. Should look thro' four large windows and display</l>
            <l>Cb. Clear, but for golden vases in the way,</l>
            <l>Cb. Their glassy diamonding on Turkish floor;</l>
            <l>Cb. The tapers keep aside, an hour and more,</l>
            <l>Cb. To see what else the moon alone can show;</l>
            <l>Cb. While the night-breeze doth softly let us know</l>
            <l>Cb. My terrace is well bower'd with oranges.</l>
            <l>Cb. Upon the floor the dullest spirit sees</l>
            <l>Cb. A guitar-ribband and a lady's glove</l>
            <l>Cb. Beside a crumple-leaved tale of love;</l>
            <l>Cb. A tambour-frame, with Venus sleeping there,</l>
            <l>Cb. All finish'd but some ringlets of her hair;</l>
            <l>Cb. A viol, bowstrings torn, cross-wise upon</l>
            <l>Cb. A glorious folio of Anacreon;</l>
            <l>Cb. A skull upon a mat of roses lying,</l>
            <l>Cb. Ink'd purple with a song concerning dying;</l>
            <l>Cb. An hour-glass on the turn, amid the trails</l>
            <l>Cb. Of passion-flower; — just in time there sails</l>
            <l>Cb. A cloud across the moon, — the lights bring in!</l>
            <l>Cb. And see what more my phantasy can win.</l>
            <l>Cb. It is a gorgeous room, but somewhat sad;</l>
            <l>Cb. The draperies are so as tho' they had</l>
            <l>Cb. Been made for Cleopatra's winding-sheet;</l>

            <l>Numb were the Beadsman's fingers, while he told</l>
            <l>His rosary, and while his frosted breath,</l>
            <l>Like pious incense from a censer old,</l>
            <l>Seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death,</l>
            <l>Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith.</l>
            <l>His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man;</l>
            <l>Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,</l>

            <l>"O mighty Princess, did you ne'er hear tell</l>
            <l>What your poor servants know but too too well?</l>
            <l>Know you the three great crimes in faery land?</l>
            <l>The first, alas!  poor Dwarf, I understand —</l>
            <l>I made a whipstock of a faery's wand —</l>
            <l>The next is snoring in their company —</l>
            <l>The next, the last, the direst of the three</l>
            <l>Is making free when they are not at home.</l>
            <l>I was a Prince — a baby Prince — my doom</l>
            <l>You see, I made a whipstock of a wand —</l>
            <l>My top has henceforth slept in faery land.</l>
            <l>He was a Prince, the Fool, a grown up prince,</l>
            <l>But he has never been a king's son since</l>
            <l>He fell a-snoring at a faery ball —</l>
            <l>Your poor Ape was a prince, and he, poor thing,</l>
            <l>Picklock'd a faery's boudoir — now no king,</l>
            <l>But Ape — so pray your highness stay awhile;</l>
            <l>'Tis sooth indeed, we know it to our sorrow —</l>
            <l>Persist and you) may be an Ape tomorrow " —</l>
            <l>While the Dwarf spake the princess all for spite</l>
            <l>Peel'd the brown hazel twig to lilly white,</l>
            <l>Clench'd her small teeth, and held her lips apart,</l>
            <l>Try'd to look unconcern'd with beating heart.</l>
            <l>They saw her highness had made up her mind</l>
            <l>Quavering like the reeds before the wind,</l>
            <l>And they had had it, but, O happy chance!</l>
            <l>The Ape for very fear began to dance</l>
            <l>And grin'd as all his ugliness did ache —</l>
            <l>She staid her vixen fingers for his sake,</l>
            <l>He was so very ugly   then she took</l>
            <l>Her pocket mirror and began to look</l>
            <l>First at herself and then at him and then</l>
            <l>She smil'd at her own beauteous face again.</l>
            <l>Yet for all this — for all her pretty face</l>
            <l>She took it in her head to see the place.</l>

            <l>So each Fair reasons, tho' it oft miscarries.</l>
            <l>She thought her pretty face would please the faeries,</l>
            <l>"My darling Ape I won't whip you today —</l>
            <l>Give me the picklock, sirrah, and go play."</l>
            <l>They all three wept — but counsel was as vain</l>
            <l>As crying " c'up, biddy " to drops of rain.</l>
            <l>Yet lingeringly did the sad Ape forth draw</l>
            <l>The picklock from the pocket in his jaw.</l>

            <l>And touch'd the wards, the door full courteously</l>
            <l>Opened — she enter'd with her servants three.</l>
            <l>Again it clos'd and there was nothing seen</l>
            <l>But the Mule grazing on the herbage green.</l>
            <l>The Mule no sooner saw himself alone</l>
            <l>Than he prick'd up his ears — and said " well done!</l>
            <l>At least, unhappy prince, I may be free —</l>
            <l>No more a princess shall side-saddle me.</l>

            <l>Aye every inch a king " — tho' " Fortune's fool " —</l>
            <l>Well done — for by what Mr. Dwarfy said</l>
            <l>I would not give a sixpence for her head."</l>

            <head>Hyperion: A Fragment. Book I</head>
            <l>Deep in the shady sadness of a vale</l>
            <l>Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,</l>
            <l>Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,</l>
            <l>Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,</l>
            <l>Still as the silence round about his lair;</l>
            <l>Forest on forest hung above his head</l>
            <l>Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,</l>
            <l>Not so much life as on a summer's day</l>
            <l>Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,</l>
            <l>But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.</l>
            <l>A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more</l>
            <l>By reason of his fallen divinity</l>
            <l>Spreading a shade   the Naiad 'mid her reeds</l>
            <l>Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.</l>
            <l>Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,</l>
            <l>No further than to where his feet had stray'd,</l>
            <l>And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground</l>
            <l>His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,</l>
            <l>Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;</l>
            <l>While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,</l>
            <l>His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="330"/>
            <l>It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;</l>
            <l>But there came one, who with a kindred hand</l>
            <l>Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low</l>
            <l>She was a Goddess of the infant world;</l>
            <l>By her in stature the tall Amazon</l>
            <l>Had stood a pigmy's height   she would have ta'en</l>
            <l>Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;</l>
            <l>Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.</l>
            <l>Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,</l>
            <l>Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,</l>
            <l>When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.</l>
            <l>But oh!  how unlike marble was that face</l>
            <l>How Beautiful, if sorrow had not made</l>
            <l>Sorrow more beautiful than beauty's self.</l>
            <l>There was a listening fear in her regard,</l>
            <l>As if calamity had but begun;</l>
            <l>As if the vanward clouds of evil days</l>
            <l>Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear</l>
            <l>Was with its stored thunder labouring up.</l>
            <l>One hand she press'd upon that aching spot</l>
            <l>Where beats the human heart, as if just there,</l>
            <l>Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain</l>
            <l>The other upon Saturn's bended neck</l>
            <l>She laid, and to the level of his ear</l>
            <l>Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake</l>
            <l>In solemn tenour and deep organ tone</l>
            <l>Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue</l>
            <l>Would come in these like accents; O how frail</l>
            <l>To that large utterance of the early Gods!</l>
            <l>"Saturn, look up!  — though wherefore, poor old King?</l>
            <l>I have no comfort for thee, no not one</l>
            <l>I cannot say, " O wherefore sleepest thou?"</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="331"/>
            <l>For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth</l>
            <l>Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;</l>
            <l>And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,</l>
            <l>Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air</l>
            <l>Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.</l>
            <l>Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,</l>
            <l>Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;</l>
            <l>And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands</l>
            <l>Scorches and burns our once serene domain.</l>
            <l>O aching time!  O moments big as years!</l>
            <l>All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,</l>
            <l>And press it so upon our weary griefs</l>
            <l>That unbelief has not a space to breathe.</l>
            <l>Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?</l>
            <l>Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?</l>
            <l>Saturn, sleep on!  while at thy feet I weep."</l>
            <l>As when, upon a tranced summer-night,</l>
            <l>Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,</l>
            <l>Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,</l>
            <l>Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,</l>
            <l>Save from one gradual solitary gust</l>
            <l>Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,</l>
            <l>As if the ebbing air had but one wave;</l>
            <l>So came these words and went; the while in tears</l>
            <l>She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,</l>
            <l>Just where her falling hair might be outspread,</l>
            <l>A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.</l>
            <l>One moon, with alteration slow, had shed</l>
            <l>Her silver seasons four upon the night,</l>
            <l>And still these two were postured motionless,</l>
            <l>Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="332"/>
            <l>The frozen God still couchant on the earth,</l>
            <l>And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:</l>
            <l>Until at length old Saturn lifted up</l>
            <l>His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,</l>
            <l>And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,</l>
            <l>And that fair kneeling Goddess: and then spake,</l>
            <l>As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard</l>
            <l>Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:</l>
            <l>"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,</l>
            <l>Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;</l>
            <l>Look up, and let me see our doom in it;</l>
            <l>Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape,</l>
            <l>Is  Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice</l>
            <l>Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,</l>
            <l>Naked and bare of its great diadem,</l>
            <l>Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power</l>
            <l>To make me desolate? whence came the strength?</l>
            <l>How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,</l>
            <l>While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?</l>
            <l>But it is so; and I am smother'd up,</l>
            <l>And buried from all godlike exercise</l>
            <l>Of influence benign on planets pale,</l>
            <l>Of admonitions to the winds and seas,</l>
            <l>Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,</l>
            <l>Doth ease its heart of love in. — I am gone</l>
            <l>Away from my own bosom: I have left</l>
            <l>My strong identity, my real self,</l>
            <l>Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit</l>
            <l>Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!</l>
            <l>Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="333"/>
            <l>Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;</l>
            <l>Space region'd with life-air; and barren void;</l>
            <l>Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.—</l>
            <l>Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest</l>
            <l>A certain shape or shadow, making way</l>
            <l>With wings or chariot fierce to repossess</l>
            <l>A heaven he lost erewhile: it must — it must</l>
            <l>Be of ripe progress — Saturn must be King.</l>
            <l>Yes, there must be a golden victory;</l>
            <l>There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown</l>
            <l>Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival</l>
            <l>Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,</l>
            <l>Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir</l>
            <l>Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be</l>
            <l>Beautiful things made new, for the surprise</l>
            <l>Of the sky-children; I will give command:</l>
            <l>Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"</l>
            <l>This passion lifted him upon his feet,</l>
            <l>And made his hands to struggle in the air,</l>
            <l>His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,</l>
            <l>His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.</l>
            <l>He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;</l>
            <l>A little time, and then again he snatch'd</l>
            <l>Utterance thus. — "But cannot I create?</l>
            <l>Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth</l>
            <l>Another world, another universe,</l>
            <l>To overbear and crumble this to nought?</l>
            <l>Where is another Chaos? Where?" — That word</l>
            <l>Found way unto Olympus, and made quake</l>
            <l>The rebel three.—Thea was startled up,</l>
            <l>And in her bearing was a sort of hope,</l>
            <l>As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.</l>
            <l>"This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,</l>
            <l>O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;</l>
            <l>I know the covert, for thence came I hither."</l>

            <l>With backward footing through the shade a space:</l>
            <l>He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way</l>
            <l>Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist</l>
            <l>Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.</l>
            <l>.</l>
            <l>Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,</l>
            <l>More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,</l>
            <l>Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:</l>
            <l>The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,</l>
            <l>Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,</l>
            <l>And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.</l>
            <l>But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept</l>
            <l>His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;—</l>
            <l>Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire</l>
            <l>Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up</l>
            <l>From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure:</l>
            <l>For as among us mortals omens drear</l>
            <l>Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he—</l>
            <l>Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,</l>
            <l>Or the familiar visiting of one</l>
            <l>Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,</l>
            <l>Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;</l>
            <l>But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,</l>
            <l>Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright,</l>
            <l>Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,</l>
            <l>And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,</l>
            <l>Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,</l>
            <l>Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;</l>
            <l>And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds</l>
            <l>Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings,</l>
            <l>Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,</l>
            <l>Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="335"/>
            <l>Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.</l>
            <l>Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths</l>
            <l>Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,</l>
            <l>Instead of sweets, his ample palate took</l>
            <l>Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick:</l>
            <l>And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west,</l>
            <l>After the full completion of fair day,—</l>
            <l>For rest divine upon exalted couch</l>
            <l>And slumber in the arms of melody,</l>
            <l>He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease</l>
            <l>While far within each aisle and deep recess,</l>
            <l>His winged minions in close clusters stood,</l>
            <l>Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men</l>
            <l>Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,</l>
            <l>When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.</l>
            <l>Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,</l>
            <l>Went step for step with Thea through the woods,</l>
            <l>Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,</l>
            <l>Came slope upon the threshold of the west;</l>
            <l>Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope</l>
            <l>In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,</l>
            <l>Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet</l>
            <l>And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;</l>
            <l>And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,</l>
            <l>In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="336"/>
            <l>That inlet to severe magnificence</l>
            <l>Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.</l>
            <l>.</l>
            <l>He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;</l>
            <l>His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,</l>
            <l>And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,</l>
            <l>That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours</l>
            <l>And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,</l>
            <l>From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,</l>
            <l>Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,</l>
            <l>And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,</l>
            <l>Until he reach'd the great main cupola;</l>
            <l>There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,</l>
            <l>And from the basements deep to the high towers</l>
            <l>Jarr'd his own golden region; and before</l>
            <l>The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,</l>
            <l>His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,</l>
            <l>To this result: "O dreams of day and night!</l>
            <l>O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!</l>

            <l>Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;</l>

            <l>Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.</l>

            <l>Up to the zenith,— hieroglyphics old,</l>
            <l>Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers</l>
            <l>Won from the gaze of many centuries:</l>
            <l>Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge</l>
            <l>Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone,</l>
            <l>Their wisdom long since fled.— Two wings this orb</l>

            <l>Awaiting for Hyperion's command.</l>
            <l>Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne</l>
            <l>And bid the day begin, if but for change.</l>
            <l>He might not:— No, though a primeval God:</l>

            <l>Therefore the operations of the dawn</l>

            <l>Those silver wings expanded sisterly,</l>

            <l>And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,</l>

            <l>His spirit to the sorrow of the time;</l>
            <l>And all along a dismal rack of clouds,</l>
            <l>Upon the boundaries of day and night,</l>
            <l>He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.</l>
            <l>There as he lay, the heaven with its stars</l>
            <l>Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice</l>
            <l>Of Coelus, from the universal space,</l>

            <l>"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born</l>

            <l>Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,</l>
            <l>Manifestations of that beauteous life</l>

            <l>Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,</l>
            <l>As thou canst move about, an evident God;</l>
            <l>And canst oppose to each malignant hour</l>
            <l>Ethereal presence:—I am but a voice;</l>
            <l>My life is but the life of winds and tides,</l>
            <l>No more than winds and tides can I avail:—</l>
            <l>But thou canst.— Be thou therefore in the van</l>

            <l>Ere half this region-whisper had come down,</l>
            <l>Hyperion arose, and on the stars</l>
            <l>Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide</l>
            <l>Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:</l>
            <l>And still they were the same bright, patient stars.</l>
            <l>Then with a slow incline of his broad breast.</l>
            <l>Like to a diver in the pearly seas,</l>
            <l>Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,</l>
            <l>And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.</l>
            <l>Just at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings</l>
            <l>Hyperion slid into the rustled air,</l>
            <l>And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place</l>
            <l>Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="341"/>
            <l>It was a den where no insulting light</l>
            <l>They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar</l>
            <l>Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,</l>
            <l>Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.</l>
            <l>Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd</l>
            <l>Ever as if just rising from a sleep,</l>
            <l>Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;</l>
            <l>And thus in thousand hugest phantasies</l>
            <l>Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.</l>
            <l>Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,</l>
            <l>Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge</l>
            <l>Stubborn'd with iron. All were not assembled:</l>
            <l>Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.</l>
            <l>Coeus, and Gyges, and Briareus,</l>

            <l>Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs</l>
            <l>Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;</l>
            <l>Without a motion, save of their big hearts</l>
            <l>Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd</l>
            <l>With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.</l>
            <l>Mnemosyne was straying in the world;</l>
            <l>Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered;</l>
            <l>And many else were free to roam abroad,</l>
            <l>But for the main, here found they covert drear.</l>
            <l>Scarce images of life, one here, one there,</l>
            <l>Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="342"/>
            <l>Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,</l>
            <l>When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,</l>
            <l>In dull November, and their chancel vault,</l>
            <l>The heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.</l>
            <l>Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave</l>
            <l>Or word, or look, or action of despair.</l>
            <l>Creu's was one; his ponderous iron mace</l>
            <l>Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock</l>
            <l>Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.</l>
            <l>Iapetus another; in his grasp,</l>
            <l>A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue</l>
            <l>Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length</l>
            <l>Dead; and because the creature could not spit</l>
            <l>Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.</l>
            <l>As though in pain; for still upon the flint</l>
            <l>He ground severe his skull, with open mouth</l>
            <l>And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him</l>
            <l>Asia, born of most enormous Caf,</l>
            <l>Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,</l>
            <l>Though feminine, than any of her sons:</l>
            <l>More thought than woe was in her dusky face,</l>
            <l>For she was prophesying of her glory;</l>
            <l>And in her wide imagination stood</l>
            <l>Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,</l>
            <l>By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.</l>
            <l>Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,</l>
            <l>So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk</l>
            <l>Shed from the broadest of her elephants.</l>
            <l>Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,</l>
            <l>Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,</l>
            <l>Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild</l>

            <l>Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,</l>
            <l>He meditated, plotted, and even now</l>

            <l>Not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods</l>
            <l>To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.</l>
            <l>Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone</l>
            <l>Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour'd close</l>
            <l>Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap</l>
            <l>Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.</l>
            <l>In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet</l>
            <l>Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;</l>
            <l>No shape distinguishable, more than when</l>
            <l>Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:</l>
            <l>And many else whose names may not be told.</l>
            <l>For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,</l>
            <l>Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt</l>
            <l>Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd</l>
            <l>With damp and slippery footing from a depth</l>
            <l>More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff</l>
            <l>Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew</l>
            <l>Till on the level height their steps found ease:</l>
            <l>Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms</l>
            <l>Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,</l>
            <l>And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:</l>
            <l>At war with all the frailty of grief,</l>
            <l>Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,</l>
            <l>Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.</l>
            <l>Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate</l>
            <l>Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,</l>
            <l>A disanointing poison: so that Thea,</l>
            <l>Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass</l>
            <l>First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.</l>
            <l>.</l>
            <l>As with us mortal men, the laden heart</l>
            <l>Is persecuted more, and fever'd more,</l>
            <l>When it is nighing to the mournful house</l>

            <l>So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,</l>
            <l>Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,</l>
            <l>But that he met Enceladus's eye,</l>
            <l>Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once</l>
            <l>Came like an inspiration: and he shouted,</l>
            <l>"Titans, behold your God!" at which some groan'd;</l>
            <l>Some started on their feet; some also shouted;</l>
            <l>Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;</l>
            <l>And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,</l>
            <l>Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,</l>
            <l>Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.</l>
            <l>There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines</l>
            <l>When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise</l>
            <l>Among immortals when a God gives sign,</l>
            <l>With hushing finger, how he means to load</l>
            <l>His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,</l>
            <l>With Thunder, and with music, and with pomp:</l>
            <l>Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;</l>
            <l>Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,</l>
            <l>No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,</l>
            <l>Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom</l>
            <l>Grew up like organ, that begins anew</l>
            <l>Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,</l>
            <l>Leave the dimn'd air vibrating silverly.</l>

            <l>O Titans, shall I say ""Arise!""— Ye groan:</l>
            <l>Shall I say ""Crouch!""— Ye groan. What can I then?"—</l>

            <l>And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,</l>

            <l>Upon that very hour, our parentage,</l>

            <l>Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;</l>
            <l>O folly! for to bear all naked truths,</l>

            <l>That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!</l>
            <l>As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far</l>
            <l>Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;</l>
            <l>And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth</l>
            <l>In form and shape compact and beautiful,</l>

            <l>So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,</l>
            <l>A power more strong in beauty, born of us</l>
            <l>And fated to excel us, as we pass</l>
            <l>In glory that old Darkness: nor are we</l>
            <l>Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule</l>
            <l>Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil</l>

            <l>Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings</l>
            <l>To wander wherewithal and find its joys?</l>
            <l>We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs</l>
            <l>Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,</l>
            <l>But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower</l>
            <l>Above us in their beauty, and must reign</l>
            <l>In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law</l>
            <l>That first in beauty should be first in might:</l>
            <l>Yea, by that law, another race may drive</l>
            <l>Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.</l>

            <l>Whether through poz'd conviction, or disdain,</l>
            <l>They guarded silence, when Oceanus</l>
            <l>Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?</l>
            <l>But so it was, none answer'd for a space,</l>
            <l>Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;</l>
            <l>And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,</l>
            <l>With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,</l>

            <l>There to remain for ever, as I fear:</l>
            <l>I would not bode of evil, if I thought</l>
            <l>So weak a creature could turn off the help</l>
            <l>Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;</l>
            <l>Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell</l>
            <l>Of what I heard, and how it made we weep,</l>
            <l>And know that we had parted from all hope.</l>
            <l>I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,</l>
            <l>Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.</l>
            <l>Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;</l>
            <l>Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;</l>
            <l>So that I felt a movement in my heart</l>

            <l>With songs of misery, music of our woes;</l>
            <l>And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell</l>
            <l>And murmur'd into it , and made melody—</l>
            <l>O melody no more! for while I sang,</l>

            <l>The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand</l>
            <l>Just opposite, an island of the sea,</l>
            <l>There came enchantment with the shifting wind,</l>
            <l>That did both drown and keep alive my ears.</l>
            <l>I threw my shell away upon the sand,</l>

            <l>With that new blissful golden melody.</l>
            <l>A living death was in each gush of sounds,</l>
            <l>Each family of rapturous hurried notes,</l>
            <l>That fell, one after one, yet all at once,</l>
            <l>Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:</l>
            <l>And then another, then another strain,</l>
            <l>Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,</l>
            <l>With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,</l>
            <l>To hover round my head, and make me sick</l>
            <l>Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,</l>
            <l>And I was stopping up my frantic ears,</l>
            <l>When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,</l>
            <l>A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,</l>
            <l>And still it cried, ""Apollo! young Apollo!</l>
            <l>The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!""</l>
            <l>I fled, it follow'd me, and cried ""Apollo!""</l>

            <l>O let him feel the evil he hath done;</l>
            <l>For though I scorn Oceanus's lore,</l>
            <l>Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:</l>
            <l>The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled;</l>
            <l>Those days, all innocent of scathing war,</l>
            <l>When all the fair Existences of heaven</l>

            <l>That was before our brows were taught to frown,</l>
            <l>Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;</l>

            <l>Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel</l>
            <l>When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.</l>

            <l>His bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view</l>

            <l>Hyperion from the peak loud answered, "Saturn!"</l>
            <l>Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,</l>

            <l>Feel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air</l>

            <l>Goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:</l>
            <l>Are there not other regions than this isle?</l>
            <l>What are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!</l>
            <l>And the most patient brilliance of the moon!</l>
            <l>And stars by thousands! Point me out the way</l>
            <l>To any one particular beauteous star,</l>
            <l>And I will flit into it with my lyre,</l>
            <l>And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss.</l>
            <l>I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?</l>
            <l>Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity</l>
            <l>Makes this alarum in the elements,</l>
            <l>While I here idle listen on the shores</l>
            <l>In fearless yet in aching ignorance?</l>
            <l>O tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,</l>
            <l>That waileth every morn and eventide,</l>
            <l>Tell me why thus I rave, about these groves!</l>
            <l>Mute thou remainest—mute! yet I can read</l>
            <l>A wondrous lesson in thy silent face:</l>
            <l>Knowledge enormous makes a God of me.</l>
            <l>Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,</l>
            <l>Majesties, sovran voices, agonies,</l>
            <l>Creations and destroyings, all at once</l>
            <l>Pour into the wide hollows of my brain,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="356"/>
            <l>And deify me, as if some blithe wine</l>
            <l>Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk,</l>
            <l>And so become immortal."—Thus the God,</l>
            <l>While his enkindled eyes, with level glance</l>
            <l>Beneath his white soft temples, stedfast kept</l>
            <l>Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.</l>
            <l>Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush</l>
            <l>All the immortal fairness of his limbs;</l>
            <l>Most like the struggle at the gate of death;</l>
            <l>Or liker still to one who should take leave</l>
            <l>Of pale immortal death, and with a pang</l>

            <l>His very hair, his golden tresses famed,</l>
            <l>Kept undulation round his eager neck.</l>
            <l>During the pain Mnemosyne upheld</l>
            <l>Her arms as one who prophesied.—At length</l>

            <l>O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,</l>
            <l>Alone and palely loitering?</l>
            <l>The sedge has wither'd from the lake,</l>

            <l>O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,</l>
            <l>So haggard and so woe-begone?</l>
            <l>The squirrel's granary is full,</l>
            <l>And the harvest's done.</l>
            <l>I see a lilly on thy brow,</l>
            <l>With anguish moist and fever dew,</l>
            <l>And on thy cheeks a fading rose</l>
            <l>Fast withereth too.</l>
            <l>I met a lady in the meads,</l>
            <l>Full beautiful — a faery's child,</l>
            <l>Her hair was long, her foot was light,</l>
            <l>And her eyes were wild.</l>
            <l>I made a garland for her head,</l>
            <l>And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;</l>
            <l>She look'd at me as she did love,</l>
            <l>And made sweet moan.</l>

            <l>I set her on my pacing steed,</l>
            <l>And nothing else saw all day long,</l>
            <l>For sidelong would she bend, and sing</l>
            <l>A faery's song.</l>
            <l>She found me roots of relish sweet,</l>
            <l>And honey wild, and manna dew,</l>
            <l>And sure in language strange she said —</l>
            <l>"I love thee true " .</l>
            <l>She took me to her elfin grot,</l>
            <l>And there she wept, and sigh'd full sore,</l>
            <l>And there I shut her wild wild eyes</l>
            <l>With kisses four.</l>
            <l>And there she lulled me asleep,</l>
            <l>And there I dream'd — Ah!  woe betide!</l>
            <l>The latest dream I ever dream'd</l>
            <l>On the cold hill side.</l>
            <l>I saw pale kings and princes too,</l>
            <l>Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;</l>
            <l>They cried — " La belle dame sans merci</l>
            <l>Hath thee in thrall!"</l>
            <l>I saw their starved lips in the gloam,</l>
            <l>With horrid warning gaped wide,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="359"/>
            <l>And I awoke and found me here,</l>
            <l>On the cold hill's side.</l>
            <l>And this is why I sojourn here,</l>
            <l>Though the sedge has wither'd from the lake,</l>
            <l>And no birds sing.</l>

            <l>Upon a time, before the faery broods</l>
            <l>Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods,</l>
            <l>Before King Oberon's bright diadem,</l>
            <l>Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,</l>
            <l>Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns</l>
            <l>From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,</l>
            <l>The ever-smitten Hermes empty left</l>
            <l>His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft</l>
            <l>From high Olympus had he stolen light,</l>
            <l>On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight</l>
            <l>Of his great summoner, and made retreat</l>
            <l>Into a forest on the shores of Crete.</l>
            <l>For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt</l>
            <l>A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt;</l>
            <l>At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured</l>
            <l>Pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored.</l>
            <l>Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,</l>
            <l>And in those meads where sometime she might haunt,</l>
            <l>Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,</l>
            <l>Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose.</l>
            <l>Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!</l>
            <l>So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat</l>
            <l>That from a whiteness, as the lily clear,</l>
            <l>Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair,</l>
            <l>Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.</l>

            <l>From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,</l>
            <l>Breathing upon the flowers his passion new,</l>
            <l>And wound with many a river to its head,</l>
            <l>To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed</l>
            <l>In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,</l>
            <l>And so he rested, on the lonely ground,</l>
            <l>Pensive, and full of painful jealousies</l>
            <l>Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.</l>
            <l>There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,</l>
            <l>Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys</l>
            <l>All pain but pity   thus the lone voice spake</l>

            <l>When move in a sweet body fit for life,</l>
            <l>And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife</l>
            <l>Of hearts and lips!  Ah, miserable me!"</l>
            <l>The God, dove-footed, glided silently</l>
            <l>Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed,</l>
            <l>The taller grasses and full-flowering weed,</l>
            <l>Until he found a palpitating snake,</l>
            <l>She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,</l>
            <l>Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;</l>
            <l>Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,</l>
            <l>Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;</l>
            <l>And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,</l>
            <l>Dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed</l>
            <l>Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries —</l>
            <l>So rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries,</l>
            <l>She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf,</l>
            <l>Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self.</l>
            <l>Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire</l>
            <l>Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar</l>
            <l>Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!</l>
            <l>She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete</l>
            <l>And for her eyes   what could such eyes do there</l>
            <l>But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?</l>
            <l>As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air.</l>
            <l>Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake</l>
            <l>Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love's sake,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="454"/>
            <l>And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay,</l>
            <l>Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey.</l>
            <l>"Fair Hermes, crown'd with feathers, fluttering light,</l>
            <l>I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,</l>
            <l>Among the Gods, upon Olympus old,</l>
            <l>The only sad one; for thou didst not hear</l>
            <l>The soft, lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear,</l>
            <l>Nor even Apollo when he sang alone,</l>
            <l>Deaf to his throbbing throat's long, long melodious moan.</l>
            <l>I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes,</l>
            <l>Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks,</l>
            <l>And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart,</l>
            <l>Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art!</l>
            <l>Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?"</l>
            <l>Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd</l>
            <l>His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired</l>
            <l>"Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent, surely high inspired!</l>
            <l>Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes,</l>
            <l>Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,</l>
            <l>Telling me only where my nymph is fled, —</l>
            <l>Where she doth breathe! "  " Bright planet, thou hast said,"</l>
            <l>Return'd the snake, " but seal with oaths, fair God!"</l>
            <l>"I swear, " said Hermes, " by my serpent rod,</l>
            <l>And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!"</l>
            <l>Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown.</l>
            <l>Then thus again the brilliance feminine</l>
            <l>"Free as the air, invisibly, she strays</l>
            <l>About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days</l>
            <l>She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet</l>
            <l>Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet;</l>
            <l>From weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green,</l>
            <l>She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen</l>
            <l>And by my power is her beauty veil'd</l>
            <l>To keep it unaffronted, unassail'd</l>
            <l>By the love-glances of unlovely eyes,</l>
            <l>OF Satyrs, fauns, and blear'd Silenus' sighs.</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="455"/>
            <l>Pale grew her immortality, for woe</l>
            <l>Of all these lovers, and she grieved so</l>
            <l>I took compassion on her, bade her steep</l>
            <l>Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep</l>
            <l>Her loveliness invisible, yet free</l>
            <l>To wander as she loves, in liberty.</l>
            <l>Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone,</l>
            <l>If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!"</l>
            <l>Then, once again, the charmed God began</l>
            <l>An oath, and through the serpent's ears it ran</l>
            <l>Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian.</l>
            <l>Ravish'd, she lifted her Circean head,</l>
            <l>"I was a woman, let me have once more</l>
            <l>A woman's shape, and charming as before.</l>
            <l>I love a youth of Corinth — O the bliss!</l>
            <l>Give me my woman's form, and place me where he is.</l>
            <l>Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,</l>
            <l>And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now."</l>
            <l>The God on half-shut feathers sank serene,</l>
            <l>She breath'd upon his eyes, and swift was seen</l>
            <l>Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.</l>
            <l>It was no dream; or say a dream it was,</l>
            <l>Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass</l>
            <l>Their pleasures in a long immortal dream.</l>
            <l>One warm, flush'd moment, hovering, it might seem</l>
            <l>Dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty, so he burn'd;</l>
            <l>Then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn'd</l>
            <l>To the swoon'd serpent, and with languid arm,</l>
            <l>Delicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm.</l>
            <l>So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent</l>
            <l>Full of adoring tears and blandishment,</l>
            <l>And towards her stept   she, like a moon in wane,</l>
            <l>Faded before him, cower'd, nor could restrain</l>
            <l>Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower</l>
            <l>That faints into itself at evening hour</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="456"/>
            <l>But the god fostering her chilled hand,</l>
            <l>She felt the warmth, her eyelids open'd bland,</l>
            <l>And, like new flowers at morning song of bees,</l>
            <l>Bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees.</l>
            <l>Into the green-recessed woods they flew;</l>
            <l>Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do.</l>
            <l>Left to herself, the serpent now began</l>
            <l>To change; her elfin blood in madness ran,</l>
            <l>Her mouth foam'd, and the grass, therewith besprent,</l>
            <l>Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent;</l>
            <l>Her eyes in torture fix'd, and anguish drear,</l>
            <l>Hot, glaz'd, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear,</l>
            <l>Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear.</l>
            <l>The colours all inflam'd throughout her train,</l>
            <l>She writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain</l>
            <l>A deep volcanian yellow took the place</l>
            <l>Of all her milder-mooned body's grace;</l>
            <l>And, as the lava ravishes the mead,</l>
            <l>Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede,</l>
            <l>Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,</l>
            <l>Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars</l>
            <l>So that, in moments few, she was undrest</l>
            <l>Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,</l>
            <l>Nothing but pain and ugliness were left.</l>
            <l>Still shone her crown; that vanish'd, also she</l>
            <l>Melted and disappear'd as suddenly;</l>
            <l>And in the air, her new voice luting soft,</l>

            <l>A full-born beauty new and exquisite?</l>
            <l>She fled into that valley they pass o'er</l>

            <milestone unit="page" n="457"/>
            <l>And rested at the foot of those wild hills,</l>
            <l>The rugged founts of the Peraean rills,</l>
            <l>And of that other ridge whose barren back</l>
            <l>Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack,</l>
            <l>South-westward to Cleone. There she stood</l>
            <l>About a young bird's flutter from a wood,</l>
            <l>Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread,</l>
            <l>By a clear pool, wherein she passioned</l>
            <l>To see herself escap'd from so sore ills,</l>
            <l>While her robes flaunted with the daffodils.</l>
            <l>Ah, happy Lycius!  — for she was a maid</l>
            <l>Or sigh'd, or blush'd, or on spring-flowered lea</l>
            <l>Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy</l>
            <l>A virgin purest lipp'd, yet in the lore</l>
            <l>Of love deep learned to the red heart's core</l>
            <l>Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain</l>

            <l>Define their pettish limits, and estrange</l>
            <l>Their points of contact, and swift counterchange;</l>
            <l>Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart</l>
            <l>Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art;</l>

            <l>Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,</l>
            <l>And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment.</l>
            <l>Why this fair creature chose so fairily</l>
            <l>By the wayside to linger, we shall see;</l>
            <l>But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse</l>
            <l>And dream, when in the serpent prison-house,</l>
            <l>Of all she list, strange or magnificent</l>
            <l>How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went;</l>

            <l>Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair</l>

            <l>Stretch'd out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine;</l>

            <l>Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line.</l>
            <l>And sometimes into cities she would send</l>
            <l>Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend;</l>
            <l>And once, while among mortals dreaming thus,</l>
            <l>She saw the young Corinthian Lycius</l>
            <l>Charioting foremost in the envious race,</l>
            <l>Like a young Jove with calm uneager face,</l>
            <l>And fell into a swooning love of him.</l>
            <l>Now on the moth-time of that evening dim</l>
            <l>He would return that way, as well she knew,</l>
            <l>To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew</l>
            <l>The eastern soft wind, and his galley now</l>
            <l>Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow</l>
            <l>In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle</l>
            <l>Fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile</l>
            <l>To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there</l>
            <l>Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare.</l>
            <l>Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire;</l>
            <l>For by some freakful chance he made retire</l>
            <l>From his companions, and set forth to walk,</l>
            <l>Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk</l>
            <l>Thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared</l>
            <l>His phantasy was lost, where reason fades,</l>
            <l>In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades.</l>
            <l>Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near —</l>
            <l>Close to her passing, in indifference drear,</l>
            <l>His silent sandals swept the mossy green;</l>
            <l>So neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen</l>
            <l>She stood   he pass'd, shut up in mysteries,</l>
            <l>His mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes</l>
            <l>Follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white</l>
            <l>Turn'd — syllabling thus, " Ah, Lycius bright,</l>
            <l>"And will you leave me on the hills alone?</l>

            <l>But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice;</l>
            <l>For so delicious were the words she sung,</l>
            <l>It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long</l>
            <l>And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,</l>
            <l>Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup,</l>
            <l>And still the cup was full, — while he, afraid</l>
            <l>Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid</l>
            <l>Due adoration, thus began to adore;</l>
            <l>"Leave thee alone!  Look back!  Ah, Goddess, see</l>

            <l>Tiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose</l>
            <l>The amorous promise of her lone complain,</l>
            <l>Swoon'd, murmuring of love, and pale with pain.</l>

            <l>Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe,</l>
            <l>But rather, if her eyes could brighter be,</l>
            <l>With brighter eyes and slow amenity,</l>
            <l>Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh</l>
            <l>The life she had so tangled in her mesh</l>
            <l>And as he from one trance was wakening</l>
            <l>Into another, she began to sing,</l>
            <l>Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,</l>

            <l>While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires.</l>
            <l>And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone,</l>
            <l>As those who, safe together met alone</l>
            <l>Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise</l>
            <l>His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,</l>
            <l>For that she was a woman, and without</l>
            <l>Any more subtle fluid in her veins</l>
            <l>Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains</l>
            <l>Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his.</l>
            <l>And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss</l>
            <l>Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said,</l>
            <l>She dwelt but half retir'd, and there had led</l>
            <l>Days happy as the gold coin could invent</l>
            <l>Without the aid of love; yet in content</l>
            <l>Till she saw him, as once she pass'd him by,</l>
            <l>Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully</l>
            <l>At Venus' temple porch, 'mid baskets heap'd</l>

            <l>But wept alone those days, for why should she adore?</l>

            <l>To see her still, and singing so sweet lays;</l>

            <l>To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known.</l>

            <l>Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,</l>
            <l>As a real woman, lineal indeed</l>
            <l>From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed.</l>
            <l>Thus gentle Lamia judg'd, and judg'd aright,</l>
            <l>That Lycius could not love in half a fright,</l>
            <l>So threw the goddess off, and won his heart</l>
            <l>More pleasantly by playing woman's part,</l>

            <l>Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh;</l>
            <l>And last, pointing to Corinth, ask'd her sweet,</l>

            <l>The way was short, for Lamia's eagerness</l>
            <l>Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease</l>
            <l>To a few paces; not at all surmised</l>
            <l>By blinded Lycius, so in her comprized.</l>
            <l>They pass'd the city gates, he knew not how,</l>
            <l>So noiseless, and he never thought to know.</l>
            <l>Throughout her palaces imperial,</l>
            <l>And all her populous streets and temples lewd,</l>
            <l>Mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd,</l>
            <l>To the wide-spreaded night above her towers.</l>
            <l>Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours,</l>
            <l>Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white,</l>
            <l>Companion'd or alone; while many a light</l>
            <l>Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals,</l>
            <l>And threw their moving shadows on the walls,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="462"/>
            <l>Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade</l>
            <l>Of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonnade.</l>
            <l>Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,</l>
            <l>Her fingers he press'd hard, as one came near</l>
            <l>With curl'd gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown,</l>
            <l>Slow-stepp'd, and robed in philosophic gown</l>
            <l>Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past,</l>
            <l>Into his mantle, adding wings to haste,</l>
            <l>While hurried Lamia trembled   " Ah, " said he,</l>
            <l>"Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully?</l>
            <l>Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew? "  —</l>
            <l>"I'm wearied, " said fair Lamia   " tell me who</l>
            <l>Is that old man?  I cannot bring to mind</l>
            <l>"Yourself from his quick eyes? "  Lycius replied,</l>
            <l>"'Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide</l>
            <l>And good instructor; but to-night he seems</l>
            <l>The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams."</l>
            <l>While yet he spake they had arrived before</l>
            <l>A pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door,</l>
            <l>Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow</l>
            <l>Reflected in the slabbed steps below,</l>
            <l>Mild as a star in water; for so new,</l>
            <l>And so unsullied was the marble hue,</l>
            <l>So through the crystal polish, liquid fine,</l>
            <l>Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine</l>
            <l>Could e'er have touch'd there. Sounds Aeolian</l>
            <l>Breath'd from the hinges, as the ample span</l>
            <l>Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown</l>
            <l>Some time to any, but those two alone,</l>
            <l>And a few Persian mutes, who that same year</l>

            <l>And but the flitter-winged verse must tell</l>
            <l>For truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel,</l>

            <head> Lamia  PART  II</head>
            <l>Love in a hut, with water and a crust,</l>
            <l>Is — Love, forgive us!  — cinders, ashes, dust;</l>
            <l>Love in a palace is perhaps at last</l>
            <l>More grievous torment than a hermit's fast   —</l>
            <l>That is a doubtful tale from faery land,</l>
            <l>Hard for the non-elect to understand.</l>
            <l>Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down,</l>
            <l>He might have given the moral a fresh frown,</l>
            <l>Or clench'd it quite   but too short was their bliss</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="464"/>
            <l>To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss.</l>
            <l>Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare,</l>
            <l>Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair,</l>
            <l>Hover'd and buzz'd his wings, with fearful roar,</l>
            <l>Above the lintel of their chamber door,</l>
            <l>And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.</l>
            <l>For all this came a ruin   side by side</l>
            <l>They were enthroned, in the even tide,</l>
            <l>Upon a couch, near to a curtaining</l>
            <l>Whose airy texture, from a golden string,</l>
            <l>Floated into the room, and let appear</l>
            <l>Betwixt two marble shafts   — there they reposed,</l>
            <l>Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,</l>
            <l>Saving a tythe which love still open kept,</l>
            <l>That they might see each other while they almost slept;</l>
            <l>When from the slope side of a suburb hill,</l>
            <l>Deafening the swallow's twitter, came a thrill</l>
            <l>Of trumpets — Lycius started — the sounds fled,</l>
            <l>But left a thought a-buzzing in his head.</l>
            <l>For the first time, since first he harbour'd in</l>
            <l>That purple-lined palace of sweet sin,</l>
            <l>His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn</l>
            <l>Into the noisy world almost forsworn.</l>
            <l>The lady, ever watchful, penetrant,</l>
            <l>Saw this with pain, so arguing a want</l>
            <l>Of something more, more than her empery</l>
            <l>Of joys; and she began to moan and sigh</l>
            <l>Because he mused beyond her, knowing well</l>
            <l>That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell.</l>
            <l>"Why do you sigh, fair creature? "  whisper'd he</l>
            <l>"Why do you think? "  return'd she tenderly</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="465"/>
            <l>"You have deserted me; — where am I now?</l>
            <l>Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow</l>
            <l>From your breast houseless   ay, it must be so."</l>
            <l>He answer'd, bending to her open eyes,</l>
            <l>Where he was mirror'd small in paradise,</l>
            <l>"My silver planet, both of eve and morn!</l>
            <l>Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,</l>
            <l>While I am striving how to fill my heart</l>
            <l>With deeper crimson, and a double smart?</l>
            <l>How to entangle, trammel up and snare</l>
            <l>Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there</l>
            <l>Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?</l>
            <l>Ay, a sweet kiss — you see your mighty woes.</l>
            <l>My thoughts!  shall I unveil them?  Listen then!</l>
            <l>What mortal hath a prize, that other men</l>
            <l>May be confounded and abash'd withal,</l>
            <l>But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,</l>
            <l>And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice</l>
            <l>Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice.</l>
            <l>Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,</l>
            <l>While through the thronged streets your bridal car</l>
            <l>Wheels round its dazzling spokes. "  — The lady's cheek</l>
            <l>Trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,</l>
            <l>Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain</l>
            <l>Of sorrows at his words; at last with pain</l>
            <l>Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,</l>
            <l>To change his purpose. He thereat was stung,</l>
            <l>Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim</l>
            <l>Her wild and timid nature to his aim</l>
            <l>Besides, for all his love, in self despite</l>
            <l>Against his better self, he took delight</l>
            <l>Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.</l>
            <l>His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue</l>
            <l>Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible</l>
            <l>In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.</l>
            <l>Fine was the mitigated fury, like</l>
            <l>Apollo's presence when in act to strike</l>
            <l>The serpent — Ha, the serpent!  certes, she</l>
            <l>Was none. She burnt, she lov'd the tyranny,</l>
            <l>And, all subdued, consented to the hour</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="467"/>
            <l>When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.</l>
            <l>Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,</l>
            <l>"Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,</l>
            <l>I have not ask'd it, ever thinking thee</l>
            <l>Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny,</l>
            <l>As still I do. Hast any mortal name,</l>
            <l>Fit appellation for this dazzling frame?</l>
            <l>To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?"</l>
            <l>"I have no friends, " said Lamia, " no, not one;</l>

            <l>Even as you list invite your many guests;</l>
            <l>But if, as now it seems, your vision rests</l>
            <l>With any pleasure on me, do not bid</l>
            <l>Old Apollonius — from him keep me hid."</l>
            <l>Lycius, perplex'd at words so blind and blank,</l>
            <l>Made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,</l>
            <l>Feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade</l>
            <l>Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd.</l>
            <l>It was the custom then to bring away</l>
            <l>The bride from home at blushing shut of day,</l>
            <l>Veil'd, in a chariot, heralded along</l>
            <l>By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,</l>
            <l>With other pageants   but this fair unknown</l>
            <l>Had not a friend. So being left alone,</l>
            <l>( Lycius was gone to summon all his kin )</l>
            <l>His foolish heart from its mad pompousness,</l>
            <l>She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress</l>
            <l>The misery in fit magnificence.</l>
            <l>She did so, but 'tis doubtful how and whence</l>
            <l>Came, and who were her subtle servitors.</l>
            <l>About the halls, and to and from the doors,</l>
            <l>There was a noise of wings, till in short space</l>
            <l>The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.</l>
            <l>A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone</l>
            <l>Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan</l>
            <l>Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.</l>
            <l>Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade</l>
            <l>Of palm and plantain, met from either side,</l>
            <l>High in the midst, in honour of the bride</l>
            <l>Two palms and then two plantains, and so on,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="469"/>
            <l>From either side their stems branch'd one to one</l>
            <l>All down the aisled place; and beneath all</l>
            <l>There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.</l>
            <l>So canopied, lay an untasted feast</l>
            <l>Teeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,</l>
            <l>Silently paced about, and as she went,</l>
            <l>In pale contented sort of discontent,</l>
            <l>The fretted splendour of each nook and niche.</l>
            <l>Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,</l>
            <l>Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst</l>
            <l>Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees,</l>
            <l>And with the larger wove in small intricacies.</l>
            <l>Approving all, she faded at self-will,</l>
            <l>And shut the chamber up, close, hush'd and still.</l>
            <l>Complete and ready for the revels rude,</l>

            <l>And show to common eyes these secret bowers?</l>

            <l>Without a gap, yet ne'er before had seen</l>
            <l>That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;</l>
            <l>So in they hurried all, maz'd, curious and keen</l>
            <l>Save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe,</l>
            <l>And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere;</l>
            <l>As though some knotty problem, that had daft</l>

            <l>He met within the murmurous vestibule</l>
            <l>His young disciple. " 'Tis no common rule,</l>
            <l>Lycius, " said he, " for uninvited guest</l>
            <l>To force himself upon you, and infest</l>
            <l>With an unbidden presence the bright throng</l>
            <l>Of younger friends; yet must I do this wrong,</l>
            <l>And you forgive me. " Lycius blush'd, and led</l>
            <l>The old man through the inner doors broad-spread;</l>
            <l>With reconciling words and courteous mien</l>
            <l>Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen.</l>

            <l>Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,</l>
            <l>Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume</l>
            <l>Before each lucid pannel fuming stood</l>
            <l>A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,</l>
            <l>Each by a sacred tripod held aloft,</l>
            <l>Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft</l>
            <l>Wool-woofed carpets   fifty wreaths of smoke</l>
            <l>From fifty censers their light voyage took</l>
            <l>To the high roof, still mimick'd as they rose</l>
            <l>Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,</l>
            <l>High as the level of a man's breast rear'd</l>
            <l>On libbard's paws, upheld the heavy gold</l>
            <l>Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told</l>
            <l>Of Ceres' horn, and, in huge vessels, wine</l>
            <l>Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine.</l>
            <l>Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood,</l>
            <l>Each shrining in the midst the image of a God.</l>
            <l>When in an antichamber every guest</l>
            <l>Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd,</l>
            <l>By minist'ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,</l>
            <l>And fragrant oils with ceremony meet</l>
            <l>Pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast</l>
            <l>In white robes, and themselves in order placed</l>
            <l>Around the silken couches, wondering</l>
            <l>Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.</l>
            <l>Soft went the music the soft air along,</l>
            <l>While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong</l>

            <l>Kept up among the guests, discoursing low</l>
            <l>At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow;</l>
            <l>But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains,</l>
            <l>Louder they talk, and louder come the strains</l>
            <l>The space, the splendour of the draperies,</l>
            <l>The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,</l>
            <l>Beautiful slaves, and Lamia's self, appear,</l>
            <l>Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed,</l>
            <l>And every soul from human trammels freed,</l>
            <l>No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,</l>
            <l>Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine.</l>
            <l>Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height;</l>
            <l>Flush'd were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright</l>
            <l>Garlands of every green, and every scent</l>

            <l>By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,</l>
            <l>Scarce saw in all the room another face,</l>
            <l>Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took</l>
            <l>Full brimm'd, and opposite sent forth a look</l>
            <l>'Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance</l>
            <l>From his old teacher's wrinkled countenance,</l>
            <l>And pledge him. The bald-head philosopher</l>
            <l>Had fix'd his eye, without a twinkle or stir</l>
            <l>Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride,</l>
            <l>Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.</l>

            <l>Know'st thou that man? "  Poor Lamia answer'd not.</l>
            <l>He gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot</l>
            <l>Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal</l>
            <l>More, more he gaz'd   his human senses reel</l>

            <l>There was no recognition in those orbs.</l>

            <l>What am I that another death come not</l>
            <l>To choak my utterance sacrilegious here?"</l>
            <l>Then said the veiled shadow — " Thou hast felt</l>

            <l>Thy fated hour. That thou hadst power to do so</l>
            <l>Is thy own safety; thou hast dated on</l>

            <l>Rot on the pavement where thou rotted'st half. —"</l>
            <l>"Are there not thousands in the world, " said I,</l>
            <l>Encourag'd by the sooth voice of the shade,</l>
            <l>"Who love their fellows even to the death;</l>
            <l>Who feel the giant agony of the world;</l>
            <l>And more, like slaves to poor humanity,</l>

            <l>Other men here   but I am here alone."</l>
            <l>"They whom thou spak'st of are no vision'ries,"</l>
            <l>Rejoin'd that voice — " They are no dreamers weak,</l>
            <l>They seek no wonder but the human face;</l>
            <l>No music but a happy-noted voice —</l>
            <l>They come not here, they have no thought to come —</l>
            <l>And thou art here, for thou art less than they —</l>
            <l>What benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,</l>
            <l>To the great world?  Thou art a dreaming thing;</l>
            <l>A fever of thyself — think of the earth;</l>
            <l>What bliss even in hope is there for thee?</l>
            <l>What haven?  Every creature hath its home;</l>
            <l>Every sole man hath days of joy and pain,</l>
            <l>The pain alone; the joy alone; distinct</l>
            <l>Only the dreamer venoms all his days,</l>
            <l>Bearing more woe than all his sins deserve.</l>
            <l>Therefore, that happiness be somewhat shar'd,</l>
            <l>Such things as thou art are admitted oft</l>
            <l>Into like gardens thou didst pass erewhile,</l>

            <l>Aye, and could weep for love of such award."</l>
            <l>So answer'd I, continuing, " if it please,</l>

            <l>What am I then?  Thou spakest of my tribe</l>
            <l>What tribe? "  — The tall shade veil'd in drooping white</l>
            <l>Then spake, so much more earnest, that the breath</l>

            <l>The poet and the dreamer are distinct,</l>
            <l>Diverse, sheer opposite, antipodes.</l>
            <l>The one pours out a balm upon the world,</l>
            <l>The other vexes it. " Then shouted I</l>
            <l>Spite of myself, and with a Pythia's spleen,</l>
            <l>"Apollo!  faded, farflown Apollo!</l>

            <l>Into the dwellings, thro' the door crannies,</l>

            <l>And careless hectorers in proud bad verse.</l>

            <l>For the broad marble knees; and who thou art,</l>
            <l>Of accent feminine, so courteous."</l>
            <l>Then the tall shade, in drooping linens veil'd,</l>
            <l>Spake out, so much more earnest, that her breath</l>

            <l>I had no words to answer; for my tongue,</l>
            <l>Useless, could find about its roofed home</l>
            <l>No syllable of a fit majesty</l>
            <l>To make rejoinder to Moneta's mourn.</l>
            <l>There was a silence while the altar's blaze</l>
            <l>Was fainting for sweet food   I look'd thereon,</l>
            <l>And on the paved floor, where nigh were pil'd</l>
            <l>Faggots of cinnamon, and many heaps</l>
            <l>Of other crisped spicewood — then again</l>
            <l>I look'd upon the altar and its horns</l>
            <l>Whiten'd with ashes, and its lang'rous flame,</l>
            <l>And then upon the offerings again;</l>
            <l>And so by turns — till sad Moneta cried,</l>
            <l>"The sacrifice is done, but not the less,</l>
            <l>Will I be kind to thee for thy goodwill.</l>
            <l>Shall be to thee a wonder; for the scenes</l>
            <l>Still swooning vivid through my globed brain</l>
            <l>With an electral changing misery</l>
            <l>Thou shalt with those dull mortal eyes behold,</l>
            <l>Free from all pain, if wonder pain thee not."</l>
            <l>As near as an immortal's sphered words</l>
            <l>Could to a mother's soften, were these last</l>
            <l>But yet I had a terror of her robes,</l>
            <l>And chiefly of the veils, that from her brow</l>
            <l>Hung pale, and curtain'd her in mysteries</l>
            <l>That made my heart too small to hold its blood.</l>
            <l>This saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand</l>
            <l>Parted the veils. Then saw I a wan face,</l>
            <l>Not pin'd by human sorrows, but bright blanch'd</l>
            <l>By an immortal sickness which kills not;</l>
            <l>It works a constant change, which happy death</l>
            <l>Can put no end to; deathwards progressing</l>
            <l>To no death was that visage; it had pass'd</l>
            <l>The lily and the snow; and beyond these</l>
            <l>I must not think now, though I saw that face —</l>
            <l>But for her eyes I should have fled away.</l>
            <l>They held me back, with a benignant light,</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="485"/>
            <l>Half closed, and visionless entire they seem'd</l>
            <l>Of all external things — they saw me not,</l>
            <l>But in blank splendor beam'd like the mild moon,</l>
            <l>Who comforts those she sees not, who knows not</l>
            <l>What eyes are upward cast. As I had found</l>
            <l>A grain of gold upon a mountain's side,</l>

            <l>So at the view of sad moneta's brow,</l>
            <l>I ached to see what things the hollow brain</l>

            <l>In the dark secret chambers of her skull</l>
            <l>Was acting, that could give so dread a stress</l>
            <l>To her cold lips, and fill with such a light</l>
            <l>Her planetary eyes; and touch her voice</l>
            <l>With such a sorrow — " Shade of Memory!"</l>
            <l>Cried I, with act adorant at her feet,</l>

            <l>Far from the fiery noon and eve's one star.</l>

            <l>Like to the image pedestal'd so high</l>
            <l>In Saturn's temple. Then Moneta's voice</l>
            <l>Came brief upon mine ear, — " So Saturn sat</l>
            <l>When he had lost his realms " — Whereon there grew</l>
            <l>A power within me of enormous ken,</l>
            <l>To see as a God sees, and take the depth</l>
            <l>Of things as nimbly as the outward eye</l>
            <l>Can size and shape pervade. The lofty theme</l>
            <milestone unit="page" n="486"/>
            <l>At those few words hung vast before my mind,</l>
            <l>With half unravel'd web. I set myself</l>
            <l>Upon an eagle's watch, that I might see,</l>
            <l>And seeing ne'er forget. No stir of life</l>
            <l>Was in this shrouded vale, not so much air</l>
            <l>As in the zoning of a summer's day</l>
            <l>But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest.</l>
            <l>A stream went voiceless by, still deaden'd more</l>
            <l>By reason of the fallen divinity</l>
            <l>Spreading more shade   the Naiad 'mid her reeds</l>
            <l>Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.</l>
            <l>Along the margin sand large footmarks went</l>
            <l>No farther than to where old Saturn's feet</l>
            <l>Had rested, and there slept, how long a sleep!</l>
            <l>Degraded, cold, upon the sodden ground</l>
            <l>His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,</l>
            <l>Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were clos'd,</l>
            <l>While his bow'd head seem'd listening to the Earth,</l>
            <l>His antient mother, for some comfort yet.</l>
            <l>It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;</l>
            <l>But there came one who with a kindred hand</l>
            <l>Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low</l>
            <l>With reverence, though to one who knew it not.</l>
            <l>Then came the griev'd voice of Mnemosyne,</l>
            <l>And griev'd I hearken'd. " That divinity</l>

            <l>With such a poor and sickly sounding pause,</l>

            <l>Still fix'd he sat beneath the sable trees,</l>

            <l>With leaves all hush'd   his awful presence there</l>
            <l>( Now all was silent ) gave a deadly lie</l>
            <l>To what I erewhile heard   only his lips</l>
            <l>Trembled amid the white curls of his beard.</l>
            <l>They told the truth, though, round, the snowy locks</l>
            <l>Hung nobly, as upon the face of heaven</l>
            <l>And stretch'd her white arm through the hollow dark,</l>
            <l>Pointing some whither   whereat he too rose</l>
            <l>Like a vast giant seen by men at sea</l>
            <l>To grow pale from the waves at dull midnight.</l>
            <l>They melted from my sight into the woods</l>
            <l>Ere I could turn, Moneta cried — " These twain</l>
            <l>Are speeding to the families of grief,</l>
            <l>Where roof'd in by black rocks they waste in pain</l>
            <l>And darkness for no hope. "  — And she spake on,</l>
            <l>As ye may read who can unwearied pass</l>
            <l>Onward from the antichamber of this dream,</l>
            <l>Where even at the open doors awhile</l>
            <l>I must delay, and glean my memory</l>
            <l>Of her high phrase   — perhaps no further dare.</l>

            <l>In melancholy realms big tears are shed,</l>
            <l>Too huge for mortal tongue, or pen of scribe.</l>
            <l>The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,</l>
            <l>Groan for the old allegiance once more,</l>
            <l>Listening in their doom for Saturn's voice.</l>
            <l>But one of our whole eagle-brood still keeps</l>
            <l>His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;</l>

            <l>From man to the Sun's God   yet unsecure,</l>

            <l>Upon the first toll of his passing bell</l>
            <l>But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,</l>

            <l>Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,</l>

            <l>Flush angerly   when he would taste the wreaths</l>
            <l>Of incense breath'd aloft from sacred hills,</l>
            <l>Savour of poisonous brass and metals sick.</l>

            <l>That, being fuddled, he went reeling through</l>
            <l>The stair-head; that being glutted as a leech,</l>

            <l>About this time, — a sad old figure of fun;</l>
            <l>Bad omen — this new match can't be a happy one.</l>
            <l>"From two till half-past, dusky way we made,</l>

            <l>Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak,</l>

            <l>She clapp'd her hands three times, and cried out " Whoop!"</l>
            <l>Some strange Imaian custom. A large bat</l>
