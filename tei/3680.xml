            <head>A Full and True
ACCOUNT
Of a Horrid and Barbarous
REVENGE by POISON, On the Body of Mr. <hi>Edm. Curll,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HISTORY furniſhes us with Examples of many Satyrical
Authors who have fallen Sacrifices to Revenge, but not
of any Bookſellers that I know of, except the unfortunate
Subject of the following Papers; I mean Mr. <hi>Edmund
Curll,</hi> at the <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>Dial</hi> in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> who was Yeſterday
poiſon'd by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> after having liv'd many Years an Inſtance of the
mild Temper of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>Every Body knows that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Edmund Curll,</hi> on Monday the
26th Inſtant, publiſh'd a Satyrical Piece, entituled <hi>Court Poems,</hi> in the
Preface whereof they were attributed to a <hi>Lady of Quality,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi>
or Mr. <hi>Gay</hi>; by which indiſcreet Method, though he had eſcaped one
Revenge, there were ſtill two behind in reſerve.</p>
            <p>Now on the Wedneſday enſuing, between the Hours of 10 and 11,
Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> a neighb'ring Bookſeller, deſir'd a Conference with Mr.
<hi>Curll</hi> about ſettling the <hi>Title Page</hi> of <hi>Wiquefort</hi>'s <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> inviting him
at the ſame Time to take a Whet together. Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> (who is not
the only Inſtance how Perſons of bright Parts may be carry'd away
by the Inſtigations of the Devil) found Means to convey himſelf into
the ſame Room, under pretence of Buſineſs with Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> who it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0859100300:3"/>
ſeems is the Printer of his <hi>Homer.</hi> This Gentleman with a ſeeming
Coolneſs, reprimanded Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> for wrongfully aſcribing to him the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
Poems: He excuſed himſelf, by declaring that one of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
(Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> by Name) gave the Copies to the Preſs, and
wrote the <hi>Preface.</hi> Upon this Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> (being to all appearance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd)
very civilly drank a Glaſs of Sack to Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> which he as
civilly pledged; and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Taſte differ'd not
from common Sack, yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer
felt ſoon after, that ſome poiſonous Drug had been ſecretly infuſed
therein.</p>
            <p>About Eleven a Clock he went home, where his Wife obſerving his
Colour chang'd, ſaid, <hi>Are you not Sick, my Dear?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>Bloody
Sick</hi>; and incontinently fell a vomiting and ſtraining in an uncommon
and unnatural Manner, the Contents of his vomiting being as Green as
Graſs. His Wife had been juſt reading a Book of her Husband's print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
concerning <hi>Jane Wenham,</hi> the famous Witch of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and her
Mind miſgave her that he was bewitch'd; but he ſoon let her know
that he ſuſpected <hi>Poiſon,</hi> and recounted to her, between the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of his Yawnings and Reachings, every Circumſtance of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
with Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> in the mean Time coming in, was extremely afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the ſudden Alteration he obſerved in him: <hi>Brother</hi> Curll, ſays he,
<hi>I fear you have got the vomiting Diſtemper, which (I have heard) kills
in half an Hour. This comes from your not following my Advice, to
drink old Hock as I do, and abſtain from Sack.</hi> Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> reply'd, in
a moving Tone, <hi>Your Author's Sack I fear has done my Buſineſs.
Z<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ds,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Lintott, My Author!—Why did not you drink
old Hock?</hi> Notwithſtanding which rough Remonſtrance, he did in the
moſt friendly Manner preſs him to take warm Water; but Mr.
<hi>Curll</hi> did with great Obſtinacy refuſe it; which made Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>
infer, that he choſe to die, as thinking to recover greater Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</p>
            <p>All this Time the Symptoms encreas'd violently, with acute Pains
in the lower Belly. <hi>Brother</hi> Lintott, ſays he, <hi>I perceive my laſt Hour
approaching, do me the friendly Office to call my Partner, Mr.</hi> Pember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<hi>that we may ſettle our Worldly Affairs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> like a kind
Neighbour, was haſtening out of the Room, while Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> rav'd
aloud in this Manner, <hi>If I ſurvive this, I will be revenged on</hi> Tonſon<hi>,
it was he firſt detected me as the Printer of theſe Poems, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
theſe very Poems in his Name.</hi> His Wife admoniſh'd him not to
think of Revenge, but to take care of his Stock and his Soul: And
in the ſame Inſtant, Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> (whoſe Goodneſs can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
applauded) return'd with Mr. <hi>Pemberton.</hi> After ſome Tears
jointly ſhed by theſe Humane Bookſellers, Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> being (as he
ſaid) in his perfect Senſes though in great bodily Pain, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
proceeded to make a verbal Will (Mrs. <hi>Curll</hi> having firſt
put on his Night Cap) in the following Manner.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0859100300:4"/>
               <p>GENTLEMEN, in the firſt Place, I do ſincerely pray Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for thoſe indirect Methods I have purſued in inventing
new Titles to old Books, putting Authors Names to Things they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw, publiſhing private Quarrels for publick Entertainment;
all which, I hope will be pardoned, as being done to get an honeſt
livelihood.</p>
               <p>I do alſo heartily beg Pardon of all Perſons of Honour, Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, Gentry, Burgeſſes, and Commonalty, to
whoſe Abuſe I have any, or every way, contributed by my Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Particularly, I hope it will be conſidered, that if I have vilify'd
his Grace the Duke of <hi>M<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

that Equality and Impartiality which becomes an honeſt Man
in Times of Faction and Diviſion.</p>
               <p>I call my Conſcience to Witneſs, that many of theſe Things which may
ſeem malicious, were done out of Charity; I having made it wholly my
Buſineſs to print for poor diſconſolate Authors, whom all other Bookſellers
refuſe: Only God bleſs Sir <hi>Richard Bl<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

as you are to have the Profit of it, Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> you are to run
the Riſque of the Reſentments of all that Noble Family. Indeed I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Author to aſſert ſeveral Things in it as Facts, which are only
idle Stories of the Town; becauſe I thought it would make the Book
ſell. Do you pay the Author for Copy Money, and the Printer and
Publiſher. I heartily beg God's, and my L<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

but all Trades muſt live.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Collection of Poems, which I groundleſly called Mr.
<hi>Prior</hi>'s, will ſell for Nothing, and hath not yet paid the Charge of the
Advertiſements, which I was obliged to publiſh againſt him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may as well ſuppreſs the Edition, and beg that Gentleman's
Pardon in the Name of a dying Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French Cato,</hi> with the Criticiſm, ſhowing how ſuperior it is to
Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s, (which I wickedly inſcribed to Madam <hi>Dacier</hi>) may be
ſuppreſs'd at a reaſonable Rate, being damnably tranſlated.</p>
               <p>I proteſt I have no Animoſity to Mr. <hi>Rowe,</hi> having printed Part of his
<hi>Callipaedia,</hi> and an incorrect Edition of his Poems without his Leave, in
Quarto. Mr. <hi>Gildon</hi>'s <hi>Rehearſal</hi>; or <hi>Bays the Younger,</hi> did more harm to
me than to Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi>; though upon the Faith of an honeſt Man, I paid
him double for abuſing both him and Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heaven pardon me for publiſhing the <hi>Trials of Sodomy</hi> in an <hi>Elzevir</hi>

my poor Widow have in Exchange the ſole Propriety of the Copy of
Madam <hi>Maſcranny.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi> interrupted, and would by no Means conſent to this
Article, about which ſome Diſpute might have ariſen, unbecoming a dying
Perſon, if Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> had not interpoſed, and Mr. <hi>Curll</hi> vomited.</p>
            <p>What this poor unfortunate Man ſpoke afterwards, was ſo indiſtinct, and in
ſuch broken Accents, (being perpetually interrupted by Vomitings) that the
Reader is intreated to excuſe the Confuſion and Imperfection of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dear Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> I beg you to beware of the Indictment at
<hi>Hicks's-Hall,</hi> for publiſhing <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s bawdy Poems; that Copy will,
otherwiſe be my beſt Legacy to my dear Wife, and helpleſs Child.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>The Caſe of Impotence</hi> was my beſt Support all the laſt long Vacation.</p>
            <p>In this laſt Paragraph Mr. <hi>Curll</hi>'s Voice grew more free, for his Vomitings
abated upon his Dejections, and he ſpoke what follows from his Cloſe-ſtole.</p>
            <q>
               <p>For the Copies of Noblemen's and Biſhop's <hi>Laſt Wills and Teſtaments,</hi>
I ſolemnly declare I printed them not with any Purpoſe of Defamation;
but meerly as I thought thoſe Copies lawfully purchaſed from <hi>Doctors
Commons,</hi> at <hi>One Shilling</hi> a Piece. Our Trade in Wills turning to ſmall
Account, we may divide them blindfold.</p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Manwaring</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> I ask Mrs. <hi>Old<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>_…</desc>
                     </gap>d</hi>'s Pardon: Neither
<hi>His,</hi> nor my Lord <hi>Halifax</hi>'s Lives, though they were of great Service
to their Country, were of any to me: But I was reſolved, ſince I could
not print their Works while they liv'd, to print their Lives after they
were dead.</p>
            </q>
            <p>While he was ſpeaking theſe Words, Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> enter'd. <hi>Ah!
Mr.</hi> Oldmixon (ſaid poor Mr. <hi>Curll</hi>) <hi>to what a Condition have your Works
reduced me! I die a Martyr to that unlucky Preface. However, in theſe my
laſt Moments, I will be juſt to all Men; you ſhall have your Third Share of
the</hi> Court Poems<hi>, as was ſtipulated. When I am dead, where will you find
another Bookſeller? Your</hi> Proteſtant Packet <hi>might have ſupported you, had
you writ a little leſs ſcurrilouſly, There is a mean in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then turning to Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> he told him, he had ſeveral <hi>Taking
Title Pages</hi> that only wanted Treatiſes to be wrote to them, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entreated, that when they were writ, his Heirs might have ſome
Share of the Profit of them.</p>
            <p>After he had ſaid this he fell into horrible Gripings, upon which Mr.
<hi>Lintott</hi> advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer. He deſir'd his Wife to
ſtep into the Shop for a Common-Prayer-Book, and read it by the Help
of a Candle, without Heſitation. He clos'd the Book, fetch'd a Groan,
and recommended to Mrs. <hi>Curll</hi> to give Forty Shillings to the Poor of
the Pariſh of St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s, and a Week's Wages Advance to each of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0859100300:6"/>
Gentlemen Authors, with ſome ſmall Gratuity in particular to Mrs.
<hi>Centlivre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poor Man continued for ſome Hours with all his diſconſolate
Family about him in Tears, expecting his final Diſſolution; when of
a ſudden he was ſurprizingly relieved by a plentiful foetid Stool, which
obliged them all to retire out of the Room. Notwithſtanding, it is
