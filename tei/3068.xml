            <p>As a new heaven is begun, and it is now thirty-three years since its 
advent: the Eternal Hell revives. And lo! Swedenborg is the Angel sitting 
at the tomb: his writings are the linen clothes folded up. Now is the dominion 
of Edom, &amp; the return of Adam into Paradise: see Isaiah XXXIV &amp; 
XXXV Chap: 
</p>
            <p>Without Contraries is no progression. Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and 
Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence. 
</p>
            <p>From these contraries spring what the religious call Good &amp; Evil. Good 
is the passive that obeys Reason. Evil is the active springing from Energy. 
Good is Heaven. Evil is Hell 
</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL </head>
            <p>All Bibles or sacred codes, have been the causes of the following Errors. 
</p>
            <p>1. That Man has two real existing principles Viz: a Body &amp; a Soul. 
</p>
            <p>2. That Energy, call'd Evil, is alone from the Body, &amp; that Reason, 
call'd Good, is alone from the Soul. 
</p>
            <p>3. That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies. 
</p>
            <p>But the following Contraries to these are True. 
</p>
            <p>1. Man has no Body distinct from his Soul; for that call'd Body is 
a portion of Soul discern'd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul 
in this age. 
</p>
            <p>2. Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound 
or outward circumference of Energy. 
</p>
            <p>3. Energy is Eternal Delight. 
</p>
            <p>Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be 
restrained; and the restrainer of reason usurps its place &amp; governs 
the unwilling. 
</p>
            <p>And being restrain'd it by degrees becomes passive till it is only the shadow 
of desire. 
</p>
            <p>The history of this written in Paradise Lost, &amp; the Governor of Reason 
is call'd Messiah. 
</p>
            <p>And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly host, 
is call'd the Devil or Satan and his children are call'd Sin &amp; Death. 
But in the Book of Job Miltons Messiah is call'd Satan. 
</p>
            <p>For this history has been adopted by both parties. 
</p>
            <p>It indeed appear'd to Reason as if Desire was cast out, but the Devils account 
is that the Messiah fell, &amp; formed 
a heaven of what he stole from the Abyss. 
</p>
            <p>This is shewn in the Gospel, where he prays to the Father to send the comforter 
or Desire that 
Reason may have Ideas to build on, the Jehovah of the Bible being no other 
than he who dwells in flaming fire. 
</p>
            <p>Know that after Christs death, he became Jehovah. 
</p>
            <p>But in Milton' the Father is Destiny, the Son, a Ratio of the five senses, 
&amp; the Holy-ghost, Vacuum! 
</p>
            <p>Note. The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels &amp; God, 
and at liberty when of Devils &amp; Hell, is because he was a true Poet 
and of the Devils party without knowing it.

            <head>A MEMORABLE FANCY</head>
            <p>As I was walking among the fires of hell, delighted with the enjoyments 
of Genius; which to Angels look like torment and insanity, I collected some 
of their Proverbs; thinking that as the sayings used in a nation, mark its 
character, so the Proverbs of Hell, shew the nature in Infernal wisdom better 
than any description of buildings or garments, 
</p>
            <p>When I came home: on the abyss of the five senses, where a flat sided steep 
frowns over the present world, I saw a mighty Devil folded in black clouds, 
hovering on the sides of the rock, with corroding fires 
he wrote the following sentence now percieved by the minds of men, 
&amp; read by them on earth. 
</p>
            <p>How do you know but ev'ry Bird that cuts the airy way, 
</p>
            <p>Is an immense world of delight, clos'd by your senses five?

            <head>PROVERBS OF HELL</head>
            <p>In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy. 
</p>
            <p>Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead. 
</p>
            <p>The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. 
</p>
            <p>Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity. 
</p>
            <p>He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence. 
</p>
            <p>The cut worm forgives the plow. 
</p>
            <p>Dip him in the river who loves water. 
</p>
            <p>A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. 
</p>
            <p>He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star. 
</p>
            <p>Eternity is in love with the productions of time. 
</p>
            <p>The busy bee has no time for sorrow. 
</p>
            <p>The hours of folly are measur'd by the clock, but of wisdom: no clock can 
measure. 
</p>
            <p>All wholsome food is caught without a net or a trap. 
</p>
            <p>Bring out number weight &amp; measure in a year of dearth. 
</p>
            <p>No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings. 
</p>
            <p>A dead body, revenges not injuries. 
</p>
            <p>The most sublime act is to set another before you. 
</p>
            <p>If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise. 
</p>
            <p>Folly is the cloke of knavery. 
</p>
            <p>Shame is Prides cloke. 
</p>
            <p>Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion. 
</p>
            <p>The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. 
</p>
            <p>The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. 
</p>
            <p>The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. 
</p>
            <p>The nakedness of woman is the work of God. 
</p>
            <p>Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps. 
</p>
            <p>The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, 
and the destructive sword, are portions of eternity too great for the eye 
of man. 
</p>
            <p>The fox condemns the trap, not himself. 
</p>
            <p>Joyes impregnate. Sorrows bring forth. 
</p>
            <p>Let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of the sheep. 
</p>
            <p>The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship. 
</p>
            <p>The selfish smiling fool, &amp; the sullen frowning fool, shall be both 
thought wise, that they may be a rod. 
</p>
            <p>What is now proved was once, only imagin'd. 
</p>
            <p>The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit: watch the roots; the lion, the 
tyger, the horse, the elephant, watch the fruits. 
</p>
            <p>The cistern contains; the fountain overflows. 
</p>
            <p>One thought, fills immensity. 
</p>
            <p>Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you. 
</p>
            <p>Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth. 
</p>
            <p>The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn of the 
crow. 
</p>
            <p>The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion. 
</p>
            <p>Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the 
night. 
</p>
            <p>He who has suffer'd you to impose on him knows you. 
</p>
            <p>As the plow follows words, so God rewards prayers. 
</p>
            <p>The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction. 
</p>
            <p>Expect poison from the standing water. 
</p>
            <p>You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough. 
</p>
            <p>Listen to the fools reproach! it is a kingly title! 
</p>
            <p>The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of 
earth. 
</p>
            <p>The weak in courage is strong in cunning. 
</p>
            <p>The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow, nor the lion, the 
horse, how he shall take his prey. 
</p>
            <p>The thankful reciever bears a plentiful harvest. 
</p>
            <p>If others had not been foolish, we should be so. 
</p>
            <p>The soul of sweet delight, can never be defil'd. 
</p>
            <p>When thou seest an Eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius, lift up thy head! 
</p>
            <p>As the catterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the 
priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. 
</p>
            <p>To create a little flower is the labour of ages. 
</p>
            <p>Damn, braces: Bless relaxes. 
</p>
            <p>The best wine is the oldest, the best water the newest. 
</p>
            <p>Prayers plow not! Praises reap not! 
</p>
            <p>Joys laugh not! Sorrows weep not! 
</p>
            <p>The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands 
&amp; feet Proportion. 
</p>
            <p>As the air to a bird of the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible. 
</p>
            <p>The crow wish'd every thing was black, the owl, that every thing was white. 
</p>
            <p>Exuberance is Beauty. 
</p>
            <p>If the lion was advised by the fox, he would be cunning. 
</p>
            <p>Improvement makes strait roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement, 
are roads of Genius. 
</p>
            <p>Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires. 
</p>
            <p>Where man is not nature is barren. 
</p>
            <p>Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd. 
</p>
            <p>Enough! or Too much! 
</p>
            <p>The ancient Poets animated all sensible objects with Gods of Geniuses, 
calling them by the names and adorning themwith the properties of woods, 
rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, nations, and whatever their enlarged &amp; 
numerous senses could percieve. 
</p>
            <p>And particularly they studied the genius of each city &amp; country, placing 
it under its mental deity. 
</p>
            <p>Till a system was formed, which some took advantage of &amp; enslav'd the 
vulgar by attempting to realize or abstract the mental deities from their 
objects; thus began Priesthood. 
</p>
            <p>Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales. 
</p>
            <p>And a length they pronounc'd that the Gods had order'd such things. 
</p>
            <p>Thus men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast. 
</p>

         <div type="part">
            <head>A MEMORABLE FANCY</head>
            <p>The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I asked them how they 
dared so roundly to assert, that God spoke to them; and whether they did 
not think at the time, that they would be misunderstood, &amp; so be the 
cause of imposition. 
</p>
            <p>Isaiah answer'd, I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical perception; 
but my senses discover'd the infinite in every thing, and as I was then 
perswaded, &amp; remain confirm'd; that the voice of honest indignation 
is the voice of God, I cared not for consequences but wrote. 
</p>
            <p>Then I aksed: does a firm perswasion that a thing is so, make it so? 
</p>
            <p>He replied, All poets that it does, &amp; in ages of imagination this firm 
perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm perswasion 
of any thing. 
</p>
            <p>Then Ezekiel said, The philosophy of the east taught the first principles 
of human perception: some nations held one principle for the origin &amp; 
some another; we of Israel taught that the Poetic Genius (as you now call 
it) was the first principle and all other others merely derivative, which 
was the cause of our despising the priests &amp; Philosophers of other countries, 
and prophecying that all Gods would at 
last be proved to originate in ours &amp; to be the tributaries of the Poetic 
Genius; it was this that our great poet King David desired so fervently 
&amp; invokes so patheticaly, saying by this he counquers enemies &amp; 
governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God, that we cursed in his name all 
deities of surrounding nations, and asserted that they had rebelled; from 
these opinions the vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be 
subject to the jews. 
</p>
            <p>This said he, like all firm perswasions, is come to pass, for all nations 
believe the jews code and worship the jews god, and what greater subjection 
can be? 
</p>
            <p>I heard this with some wonder, &amp; must confess my own conviction. After 
dinner I ask'd Isaiah to favour the world with his lost works, he said none 
of equal value was lost. Ezekiel said the same of his. 
</p>
            <p>I also asked Isaiah what made him go naked and barefoot three years? he 
answer'd, the same that made our friend Diogenes the Grecian. 
</p>
            <p>I then asked Ezekiel, why he eat dung, &amp; lay so long on his right &amp; 
left side? he answer'd, the desire of raising other men into a perception 
of the infinite; this the North American tribes practise, &amp; is he honest 
who resists his genius or conscience only for the sake of present ease or 
gratification? 
</p>
            <p>The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the 
end of six thousand years is true, as I have heard from Hell. 
</p>
            <p>For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard 
at tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed, 
and appear infinite, and holy whereas it now appears finite &amp; corrupt. 
</p>
            <p>This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment. 
</p>
            <p>But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul, is to be 
expunged: this I shall do, by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, 
which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, 
and displaying the infinite which was hid. 
</p>
            <p>If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man 
as it is, infinite. 
</p>
            <p>For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks 
of his cavern. 
</p>

            <p>I was in a Printing house in Hell &amp; saw the method in which knowledge 
is transmitted from generation to generation. 
</p>
            <p>In the first chamber was a Dragon-Man, clearing away the rubbish from a 
caves moth; within, a number of Dragons were hollowing the cave.

            <p>In the second chamber was a Viper folding round the rock &amp; the cave, 
and others adorning it with gold, silver and precious stones. 
</p>
            <p>In the third chamber was an Eagle with wings and feathers of air; he caused 
the inside of the cave to be infinite; around were numbers of Eagle like 
men, who built palaces in the immense cliffs. 
</p>
            <p>In the fourth chamber were Lions of flaming fire raging around &amp; melting 
the metals into living fluids. 
</p>
            <p>In the fifth chamber were Unnam'd forms, which cast the metals into the 
expanse. 
</p>
            <p>There they were reciev'd by Men who occupied the sixth chamber, and took 
the forms of books &amp; were arranged in libraries. 
</p>
            <p>The Giants who formed this world into its sensual existence and now seem 
to live in it in chains, are in truth, the causes of its life &amp; the 
souces of all activity; but the chains are, the cunning of weak and tame 
minds, which have power to resist energy, according to the proverb, the 
weak incourage is strong in cunning. 
</p>
            <p>Thus one portion of being, is the Prolific, the other, the Devouring: to 
the devourer it seems as if the producer was in his chains, but it is not 
so; he only takes portions of existence and fancies that the whole. 
</p>
            <p>But the Prolific would cease to be Prolific unless the Devourer as a sea 
recieved the excess of his delights. 
</p>
            <p>Some will say, Is not God alone the Prolific? I answer, God only Acts &amp; 
Is, in existing beings or Men. 
</p>
            <p>These two classes of men are always upon earth, &amp; they sould be enemies; 
whoever tries 
to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence. 
</p>
            <p>Religion is an endeavour to reconcile the two. 
</p>
            <p>Note. Jesus Christ did not wish to unite but to seperate them, as in the Parable 
of sheep and goats! &amp; he says I came not to send Peace but a Sword. 
</p>
            <p>Messiah or Satan or Tempter was formerly thought to be one of the Antediluvians 
who are our Energies.

            <head>A MEMORABLE FANCY</head>
            <p>An Angel came to me and said O pitiable foolish young man! O horrible! 
O dreadful state! consider the hot burning dungeon thou art preparing for 
thyself to all eternity, to which thou art going in such career. 
</p>
            <p>I said, perhaps you will be willing to shew me my eternal lot &amp; we will 
contemplate together upon it and see whether your lot or mine is most desirable. 
</p>
            <p>So he took me thro' a stable &amp; thro' a church &amp; down into the church 
vault at the end of which was a mill: thro' the mill we went, and came to 
a cave, down the winding cavern we groped our tedious way till a void boundless 
as a nether sky appear'd beneath us, &amp; we held by the roots of trees 
and hung over this immensity, but I said, if you please we will commit ourselves 
to this void, and see whether providence is here also, if you will not, 
I will? but he answer'd, do not presume O young-man but as we here remain 
behold thy lot which will soon appear when the darkness passes away. 
</p>
            <p>So I remain'd with him sitting in the twisted 
root of an oak; he was suspended in a fungus, which hung with the 
head downward into the deep. 
</p>
            <p>By degrees we beheld the infinite Abyss, fiery as the smoke of a burning 
city; beneath us at an immense distance was the sun, black but shining; 
round it were fiery tracks on which revolv'd vast spiders, crawling after 
their prey; which flew or rather swum in the infinite deep, in the most 
terrific shapes of animals sprung from corruption, &amp; the air was full 
of them, &amp; seem'd composed of them; these are Devils, and arc called 
Powers of the air. I now asked my companion which was my eternal lot? he 
said, between the black &amp; white spiders. 
</p>
            <p>But now, from between the black &amp; white spiders, a cloud and fire burst 
and rolled thro' the deep, black'ning all beneath, so that the nether deep 
grew black as a sea &amp; rolled with a terrible noise; beneath us was nothing 
now to be seen but a black tempest, till looking east between the clouds 
&amp; the waves, we saw a cataract of blood mixed with fire, and not many 
stones throw from us appear'd and sunk again the scaly fold of a monstrous 
serpent; at last to the east, distant about three degrees appear'd a fiery 
crest above the waves; slowly it reared like a ridge of golden rocks till 
we discover'd two globes of crimson fire, from which the sea fled away in 
clouds of smoke, and now we saw, it was the head of Leviathan; his forehead 
was divided into streaks of green &amp; purple like those on a tygers forehead: 
soon we saw his mouth &amp; red gills hang just above the raging foam tinging 
the black deep with beams of blood, advancing toward 
us with all the fury of a spiritual existence. 
</p>
            <p>My friend the Angel climb'd up from his station into the mill; I remain'd 
alone, &amp; then this appearance was no more, but I found myself sitting 
on a pleasant bank beside a river by moonlight hearing a harper who sung 
to the harp, &amp; his theme was, The man who never alters his opinion is 
like standing water, &amp; breeds reptiles of the mind. 
</p>
            <p>But I arose, and sought for the mill &amp; there I found my Angel, who surprised 
asked me how I escaped? 
</p>
            <p>I answer'd, All that we saw was owing to your metaphysics; for when you 
ran away, I found myself on a bank by moonlight hearing a harper. 
</p>
            <p>But now we have seen my eternal lot, shall I shew you yours? he laugh'd 
at my proposal; but I by force suddenly caught him in my arms, &amp; flew 
westerly thro' the night, till we were elevated above the earths shadow; 
then I flung myself with him directly into the body of the sun; here I clothed 
myself in white, &amp; taking in my hand Swedenborgs volumes, sunk from 
the glorious clime, and passed all the planets till we came to saturn; here 
I staid to rest, &amp; then leap'd into the void, between saturn &amp; the 
fixed stars. 
</p>
            <p>Here, said I! is your lot, in this space, if space it may be call'd. Soon 
we saw the stable and the church, &amp; I took him to the altar and open'd 
the Bible, and lo! it was a deep pit, into which I descended driving the 
Angel before me; soon we saw seven houses of brick; one we enter'd; in it 
were a number of monkeys, baboons, &amp; 
all of that species, chain'd by the middle, grinning and snatching at one 
another, but witheld by the shortness of their chains; however I saw that 
they sometimes grew numerous, and then the weak were caught by the strong, 
and with a grinning aspect, first coupled with &amp; then devour'd, by 
plucking off first one limb and then another till the body was left a helpless 
trunk; this after grinning &amp; kissing it with seeming fondness they devour'd 
too; and here &amp; there I saw one savourily picking the flesh off of his 
own tail; as the stench terribly annoy'd us both we went into the mill, 
&amp; I in my hand brought the skeleton of a body, which in the mill was 
Aristotles Analytics. 
</p>
            <p>So the Angel said: thy phantasy has imposed upon me &amp; thou oughtest 
to be ashamed. 
</p>
            <p>I answer'd: we impose on one another, &amp; it is but lost time to converse 
with you whose works are only Analytics. 
</p>
            <p>Opposition is true Friendship. 
</p>
            <p>I have always found that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves 
as the only wise; this they do with a confident insolence sprouting from 
systematic reasoning: 
</p>
            <p>Thus Swedenborg boasts that what he writes is new; tho' it is only the Contents 
or Index of already publish'd books. 
</p>
            <p>A man carried a monkey about for a shew, &amp; because he was a little wiser 
than the monkey, grew vain, and conciev'd himself as much wiser than seven 
men. It is so with Swedenborg; he shews the folly of churches &amp; exposes 
hypocrites, till he imagines that all are religious, &amp; himself the single 
one on earth that ever broke a net. 
</p>
            <p>Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new truth: Now hear 
another: he has written all the old falsehoods. 
</p>
            <p>And now hear the reason. He conversed with Angels who are all religious, 
&amp; conversed not with Devils who all hate religion, for he was incapable 
thro' his conceited notions. 
</p>
            <p>Thus Swedenborgs writings are a recapitulation of all superficial, opinions, 
and an analysis of the more sublime, but no further. 
</p>
            <p>Have now another plain fact: Any man of mechanical talents may from the 
writings of Paracelsus or Jacob Behmen, produce ten thousand volumes of 
equal value with Swedenborgs, and from those of Dante or Shakespear, an 
infinite number. 
</p>
            <p>But when he has done this, let him not say that he knows better than his 
master, for he only holds a candle in sunshine. 
</p>

         <div type="part">
            <head>A MEMORABLE FANCY </head>
            <p>Once I saw a Devil in a flame of fire, who arose before an Angel that 
sat on a cloud, and the Devil utter'd these words. 
</p>
            <p>The worship of God is, Honouring his gifts in other men each according to 
his genius, and loving the greatest men 
best; those who envy or calumniate great men hate God, for there is no other 
God. 
</p>
            <p>The Angel hearing this became almost blue, but mastering himself he grew 
yellow, &amp; at last white pink &amp; smiling, and then replied, 
</p>
            <p>Thou Idolater, is not God One? &amp; is not he visible in Jesus Christ? 
and has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to the law often commandments, 
and are not all other men fools, sinners, &amp; nothings? 
</p>
            <p>The Devil answer'd: bray a fool in a morter with wheat, yet shall not his 
folly be beaten out of him; if Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you ought 
to love him in the greatest degree; now hear how he has given his sanction 
to the law of ten commandments: did he not mock at the sabbath, and so mock 
the sabbaths God? murder those who were murder'd because of him? turn away 
the law from the woman taken in adultery? steal the labor of others to support 
him? bear false witness when he omitted making a defence before Pilate? 
covet when he pray'd for his disciples, and when he bid them shake off the 
dust of their feet against such as refused to lodge them? I tell you, no 
virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments; Jesus was all 
virtue, and acted from impulse, not from 
rules. 
</p>
            <p>When he had so spoken: I beheld the Angel who stretched out his arms embracing 
the flame of fire, &amp; he was consumed and arose as Elijah. 
</p>
            <p>Note. This Angel, who is now become a Devil, is my particular friend; we 
often read the Bible together in its infernal or diabolical sense which 
the world shall have if they behave well. 
</p>
            <p>I have also: The Bible of Hell: which the world shall have whether they 
will or no. 
</p>
            <p>One Law for the Lion &amp; Ox is Oppression.

            <head>A SONG OF LIBERTY </head>
            <p>1. The Eternal Female groan'd! it was heard over all the Earth: 
</p>
            <p>2. Albions coast is sick silent; the American meadows faint! 
</p>
            <p>3. Shadows of Prophecy shiver along by the lakes and the rivers and mutter 
across the ocean. France rend down thy dungeon; 
</p>
            <p>4. Golden Spain burst the barriers of old Rome; 
</p>
            <p>5. Cast thy keys O Rome into the deep down falling, even to eternity down 
falling, 
</p>
            <p>6. And weep. 
</p>
            <p>7. In her trembling hands she took the new born terror howling; 
</p>
            <p>8. On those infinite mountains of light, now barr'd out by the atlantic 
sea, the new born fire stood before the starry king! 
</p>
            <p>9. Flag'd with grey brow'd snows and thunderous visages the jealous wings 
wav'd over the deep. 
</p>
            <p>10. The speary hand burned aloft, unbuckled was the shield, forth went the 
hand of jealousy among the flaming hair, and 
hurl'd the new born wonder thro' the starry night. 
</p>
            <p>11. The fire, the fire, is falling! 
</p>
            <p>12. Look up! look up! O citizen of London, enlarge thy countenance; O Jew, 
leave counting gold! return to thy oil and wine; O African! black African! 
(go, winged thought, widen his forehead.) 
</p>
            <p>13. The fiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot like the sinking sun into the 
western sea. 
</p>
            <p>14 Wak'd from his eternal sleep, the hoary element roaring fled away; 
</p>
            <p>15. Down rush'd beating his wings in vain the jealous king; his grey brow'd 
councellors, thunderous warriors, curl'd veterans, among helms, and shields, 
and chariots, horses, elephants: banners, castles, slings, and rocks, 
</p>
            <p>16. Falling, rushing, ruining! buried in the ruins, on Urthona's dens; 
</p>
            <p>17. All night beneath the ruins, then their sullen flames faded emerge round 
the gloomy King. 
</p>
            <p>18. With thunder and fire: leading his starry hosts thro' the waste wilderness, 
he promulgates his ten commands, glancing: 
his beamy eyelids over the deep in dark dismay, 
</p>
            <p>19. Where the son of fire in his eastern cloud, while the morning plumes 
her Golden breast, 
</p>
            <p>20. Spurning the clouds written with curses, stamps the stony law to dust, 
loosing: the eternal horses from the dens of night, crying,
