            <p>THE ſubject of this poem is founded on a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that happened during the late war.— A young lady, not meeting with the concurrence of her relations in favour of an officer for whom ſhe expreſſed her regard, was prevailed upon, by his ſolicitations, to conſent to a clandeſtine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; which took place on the day he ſat out to join his regiment abroad, where he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately killed in an engagement.</p>
