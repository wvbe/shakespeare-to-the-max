               <head>Chapter 1</head>
               <p n="N1.1.1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of
Abraham:

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.2">Abraham begot Isaac.  And Isaac begot Jacob.  And Jacob begot Judas and his
brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.3">And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar.  And Phares begot Esron.  And
Esron begot Aram.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.4">And Aram begot Aminadab. And Aminadab begot Naasson. And Naasson begot
Salmon.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.5">And Salmon begot Booz of Rahab.  And Booz begot Obed of Ruth.  And Obed
begot Jesse.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.6">And Jesse begot David the king.  And David the king begot Solomon, of her
that had been the wife of Urias.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.7">And Solomon begot Roboam.  And Roboam begot Abia.  And Abia begot Asa.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.8">And Asa begot Josaphat.  And Josaphat begot Joram.  And Joram begot Ozias.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.9">And Ozias begot Joatham.  And Joatham begot Achaz.  And Achaz begot
Ezechias.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.10">And Ezechias begot Manasses.  And Manesses begot Amon.  And Amon begot
Josias.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.11">And Josias begot Jechonias and his brethren in the transmigration of
Babylon.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.12">And after the transmigration of Babylon, Jechonias begot Salathiel.  And
Salathiel begot Zorobabel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.13">And Zorobabel begot Abiud.  And Abiud begot Eliacim.  And Eliacim begot Azor.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.14">And Azor begot Sadoc.  And Sadoc begot Achim.  And Achim begot Eliud.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.15">And Eliud begot Eleazar.  And Eleazar begot Mathan.  And Mathan begot Jacob.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.16">And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who
is called Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.17">So all the generations, from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations.
And from David to the transmigration of Babylon, are fourteen generations:
and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.18">Now the generation of Christ was in this wise.  When as his mother Mary was
espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child, of
the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.19">Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly
to expose her, was minded to put her away privately.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.20">But while he thought on these things, behold the angel of the Lord
appeared to him in his sleep, saying:  Joseph, son of David, fear not to
take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the
Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.21">And she shall bring forth a son:  and thou shalt call his name JESUS.  For
he shall save his people from their sins.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.22">Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by
the prophet, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.23">Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.24">And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had
commanded him, and took unto him his wife.

</p>
               <p n="N1.1.25">And he knew her not till she brought forth her firstborn son:  and he called
his name JESUS.

               <head>Chapter 2</head>
               <p n="N1.2.1">When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king
Herod, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.2">Saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews?  For we have seen his
star in the east, and are come to adore him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.3">And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.4">And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the
people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.5">But they said to him:  In Bethlehem of Juda.  For so it is written by the
prophet:

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.6">And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes
of Juda:  for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my
people Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.7">Then Herod, privately calling the wise men, learned diligently of them the
time of the star which appeared to them;

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.8">And sending them into Bethlehem, said:  Go and diligently inquire after
the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may
come to adore him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.9">Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they
had seen in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the
child was.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.10">And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.11">And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother,
and falling down they adored him; and opening their treasures, they offered
him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.12">And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to
Herod, they went back another way into their country.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.13">And after they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in
sleep to Joseph, saying:  Arise, and take the child and his mother, and fly
into Egypt:  and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass
that Herod will seek the child to destroy him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.14">Who arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and retired into
Egypt:  and he was there until the death of Herod:

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.15">That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying:
Out of Egypt have I called my son.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.16">Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding
angry; and sending killed all the men children that were in Bethlehem, and in
all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time
which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.18">A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and great mourning; Rachel
bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.19">But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to
Joseph in Egypt,

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.20">Saying:  Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land
of Israel.  For they are dead that sought the life of the child.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.21">Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of
Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.22">But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod his
father, he was afraid to go thither:  and being warned in sleep retired into
the quarters of Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.2.23">And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth:  that it might be fulfilled
which was said by prophets:  That he shall be called a Nazarene.

               <head>Chapter 3</head>
               <p n="N1.3.1">And in those days cometh John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.2">And saying:  Do penance:  for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.3">For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias the prophet, saying:  A voice
of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his
paths.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.4">And the same John had his garment of camels' hair, and a leathern girdle
about his loins:  and his meat was locusts and wild honey.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.5">Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the country about
Jordan:

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.6">And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.7">And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he
said to them:  Ye brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the
wrath to come?

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.8">Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.9">And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father.
For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to
Abraham.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.10">For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees.  Every tree therefore
that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.11">I indeed baptize you in the water unto penance, but he that shall come
after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall
baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.12">Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and
gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable
fire.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.13">Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized
by him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.14">But John stayed him, saying:  I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest
thou to me?

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.15">And Jesus answering, said to him:  Suffer it to be so now.  For so it
becometh us to fulfill all justice.  Then he suffered him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.16">And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water:  and lo, the
heavens were opened to him:  and he saw the Spirit of God descending as
a dove, and coming upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.3.17">And behold a voice from heaven, saying:  This is my beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased.

               <head>Chapter 4</head>
               <p n="N1.4.1">Then Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the
devil.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.2">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was
hungry.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.3">And the tempter coming said to him:  If thou be the Son of God, command
that these stones be made bread.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.4">Who answered and said:  It is written, Not in bread alone doth man live,
but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.5">Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him upon the
pinnacle of the temple,

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.6">And said to him:  If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is
written:  That he hath given his angels charge over thee, and in their hands
shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.7">Jesus said to him:  It is written again:  Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
thy God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.8">Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain, and shewed him all
the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.9">And said to him:  All these will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt
adore me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.10">Then Jesus saith to him:  Begone, Satan:  for it is written, The Lord thy
God shalt thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.11">Then the devil left him; and behold angels came and ministered to him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.12">And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he retired into
Galilee:

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.13">And leaving the city Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capharnaum on the sea
coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.14">That it might be fulfilled which was said by Isaias the prophet:

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.15">Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond the
Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.16">The people that sat in darkness, hath seen great light:  and to them that
sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.17">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say:  Do penance, for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.18">And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is
called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they
were fishers).

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.19">And he saith to them:  Come ye after me, and I will make you to be
fishers of men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.20">And they immediately leaving their nets, followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.21">And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of
Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending
their nets:  and he called them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.22">And they forthwith left their nets and father, and followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.23">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and
preaching the gospel of the kingdom:  and healing all manner of sickness and
every infirmity, among the people.

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.24">And his fame went throughout all Syria, and they presented to him all
sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and such as
were possessed by devils, and lunatics, and those that had palsy, and he cured
them:

</p>
               <p n="N1.4.25">And much people followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from
Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.

set down, his disciples came unto him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.2">And opening his mouth, he taught them, saying:

               <p n="N1.5.5">Blessed are they that mourn:  for they shall be comforted.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.6">Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice:  for they shall
have their fill.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.7">Blessed are the merciful:  for they shall obtain mercy.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.8">Blessed are the clean of heart:  for they shall see God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.9">Blesses are the peacemakers:  for they shall be called children of God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.10">Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice' sake:  for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.11">Blessed are ye when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak
all that is evil against you, untruly, for my sake:

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.12">Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven. For so they
persecuted the prophets that were before you.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.13">You are the salt of the earth.  But if the salt lose its savour, wherewith
shall it be salted?  It is good for nothing any more but to be cast out, and to
be trodden on by men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.14">You are the light of the world.  A city seated on a mountain cannot be hid.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.15">Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a
candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the house.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.16">So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.17">Do not think that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets.  I am
not come to destroy, but to fulfill.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.18">For amen I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one
tittle shall not pass of the law, till all be fulfilled.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.19">He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments, and shall
so teach men, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But he that
shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.20">For I tell you, that unless your justice abound more than that of the
scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.21">You have heard that it was said to them of old:  Thou shalt not kill.  And
whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.22">But I say to you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in
danger of the judgment.  And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall
be in danger of the council.  And whosoever shall say, Thou Fool, shall be in
danger of hell fire.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.23">If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou remember
that thy brother hath any thing against thee;

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.24">Leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be reconciled
to thy brother:  and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.25">Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes, whilst thou art in the way
with him:  lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge
deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.26">Amen I say to thee, thou shalt not go out from thence till thou repay
last farthing.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.27">You have heard that it was said to them of old:  Thou shalt not commit
adultery.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.28">But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her,
hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.29">And if thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it from
thee.  For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish,
rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.30">And if thy right hand scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee:
for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather
than that thy whole body be cast into hell.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.31">And it hath been said, Whoseoever shall put away his wife, let him give
her a bill of divorce.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.32">But I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, excepting for
the cause of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery:  and he that shall
marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.33">Again you have heard that it was said to them of old, Thou shalt not
forswear thyself:  but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.34">But I say to you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the
throne of God:

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.35">Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool:  nor by Jerusalem, for it is
the city of the great king:

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.36">Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair
white or black.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.37">But let your speech be yea, yea:  no, no:  and that which is over and
above these, is of evil.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.38">You have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for
a tooth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.39">But I say to you not to resist evil:  but if one strike thee on thy right
cheek, turn to him also the other:

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.40">And if a man will contend with thee in judgment, and take away thy coat,
let go thy cloak also unto him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.41">And whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two,

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.42">Give to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow of thee
turn not away.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.43">You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and
hate thy enemy.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.44">But I say to you, Love your enemies:  do good to them that hate you:  and
pray for them that persecute and calumniate you:

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.45">That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who maketh
his sun to rise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon the just and
the unjust.

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.46">For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have?  do not
even the publicans this?

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.47">And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more?  do not also the
heathens this?

</p>
               <p n="N1.5.48">Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.

that in their much speaking they may be heard.

</p>
               <p n="N1.6.8">Be not you therefore like to them, for your Father knoweth what is needful
for you, before you ask him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.6.9">Thus therefore shall you pray:  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be

</p>
               <p n="N1.6.13">And lead us not into temptation.  But deliver us from evil.  Amen.

</p>
               <p n="N1.6.25">Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall
eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on.  Is not the life more than
the meat:  and the body more than the raiment?

</p>
               <p n="N1.6.26">Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor

how they grow:  they labour not, neither do they spin.

</p>
               <p n="N1.6.29">But I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as
one of these.

into the oven, God doth so clothe:  how much more you, O ye of little

               <p n="N1.8.21">And another of his disciples said to him:  Lord, suffer me first to go and
bury my father.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.22">But Jesus said to him:  Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.23">And when he entered into the boat, his disciples followed him:

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.24">And behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered
with waves, but he was asleep.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.25">And they came to him, and awaked him, saying:  Lord, save us, we perish.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.26">And Jesus saith to them:  Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith?  Then
rising up he commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.27">But the men wondered, saying:  What manner of man is this, for the winds
and the sea obey him?

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.28">And when he was come on the other side of the water, into the country of
the Gerasens, there met him two that were possessed with devils, coming out
of the sepulchres, exceeding fierce, so that none could pass by that way.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.29">And behold they cried out, saying:  What have we to do with thee, Jesus
Son of God?  art thou come hither to torment us before the time?

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.30">And there was, not far from them, an herd of many swine feeding.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.31">And the devils besought him, saying:  If thou cast us out hence, send us
into the herd of swine.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.32">And he said to them: Go. But they going out went into the swine, and
behold the whole herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea: and
they perished in the waters.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.33">And they that kept them fled:  and coming into the city, told every thing,
and concerning them that had been possessed by the devils.

</p>
               <p n="N1.8.34">And behold the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him,
they besought him that he would depart from their coasts.

               <p n="N1.9.1">And entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own
city.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.2">And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed.  And
Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man sick of the palsy:  Be of good
heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.3">And behold some of the scribes said within themselves:  He blasphemeth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.4">And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said:  Why do you think evil in your
hearts?

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.5">Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee:  or to say,
Arise, and walk?

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.6">But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive
sins, (then said he to the man sick of palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed,
and go into thy house.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.7">And he arose, and went into his house.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.8">And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glorified God that gave such
power to men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.9">And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom
house, named Matthew; and he saith to him:  Follow me. And he rose up and
followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.10">And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many
publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.11">And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples:  Why doth your master
eat with publicans and sinners?

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.12">But Jesus hearing it, said:  They that are in health need not a physician,
but they that are ill.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.13">Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice.
For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.14">Then came to him the disciples of John, saying:  Why do we and the
Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples do not fast?

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.15">And Jesus said to them:  Can the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long
as the bridegroom is with them?  But the days will come, when the
bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.16">And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth unto an old garment.  For it taketh
away the fullness thereof from the garment, and there is made a greater
rent.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.17">Neither do they put new wine into old bottles.  Otherwise the bottles break,
and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish.  But new wine they put
into new bottles:  and both are preserved.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.18">And he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came
up, and adored him, saying:  Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come,
lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.19">And Jesus rising up followed him, with his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.20">And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years,
came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.21">For she said within herself:  If I shall touch only his garment, I shall
be healed.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.22">But Jesus turning and seeing her, said:  Be of good heart, daughter, thy
faith hath made thee whole.  And the woman was made whole from that hour.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.23">And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels
and the multitude making a rout,

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.24">He said:  Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth.  And they
laughed him to scorn.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.25">And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the
hand.  And the maid arose.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.26">And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.27">And as Jesus passed from thence, there followed him two blind men crying
out and saying, Have mercy on us, O Son of David.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.28">And when he was come to the house, the blind men came to him.  And Jesus
saith to them, Do you believe, that I can do this unto you?  They say to
him, Yea, Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.29">Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it done
unto you.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.30">And their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See
that no man know this.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.31">But they going out, spread his fame abroad in all that country.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.32">And when they were gone out, behold they brought him a dumb man,
possessed with a devil.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.33">And after the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke, and the multitudes
wondered, saying, Never was the like seen in Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.34">But the Pharisees said, By the prince of devils he casteth out devils.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.35">And Jesus went about all the cities, and towns, teaching in their
synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every
disease, and every infirmity.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.36">And seeing the multitudes, he had compassion on them:  because they were
distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.37">Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is great, but the
labourers are few.

</p>
               <p n="N1.9.38">Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers
into his harvest.

               <p n="N1.10.1">And having called his twelve disciples together, he gave them power over
unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of diseases,
and all manner of infirmities.

</p>
               <p n="N1.10.2">And the names of the twelve apostles are these:  The first, Simon who is

               <p n="N1.10.5">These twelve Jesus sent:  commanding them, saying:  Go ye not into the way

as serpents and simple as doves.

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.2">Now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ:  sending two of his

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.4">And Jesus making answer said to them:  Go and relate to John what you have

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.5">The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.7">And when they went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes
concerning John:  What went you out into the desert to see?  a reed shaken
with the wind?

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.8">But what went you out to see?  a man clothed in soft garments?  Behold they
that are clothed in soft garments, are in the houses of kings.

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.9">But what went you out to see?  a prophet?  yea I tell you, and more than
a prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.10">For this is he of whom it is written:  Behold I send my angel before thy

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.11">Amen I say to you, there hath not risen among them that are born of women
a greater than John the Baptist:  yet he that is the lesser in the kingdom
of heaven is greater than he.

</p>
               <p n="N1.11.12">And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence, and the violent bear it away.

               <p n="N1.11.13">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John:

had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you, they had

and they that were with him:

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.4">How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the loaves of
proposition, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for them that
were with him, but for the priests only?

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.5">Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath days the priests in
the temple break the sabbath, and are without blame?

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.6">But I tell you that there is here a greater than the temple.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.7">And if you knew what this meaneth:  I will have mercy, and not sacrifice:
you would never have condemned the innocent.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.8">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.9">And when he has passed from thence, he came into their synagogues.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.10">And behold there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him,
saying:  Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?  that they might
accuse him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.11">But he said to them:  What man shall there be among you, that hath one
sheep:  and if the same fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not
take hold on it and lift it up?

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.12">How much better is a man than a sheep?  Therefore it it lawful to do a
good deed on the sabbath days.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.13">Then he saith to the man:  Stretch forth thy hand; and he stretched it
forth, and it was restored to health even as the other.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.14">And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him, how they
might destroy him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.15">But Jesus knowing it, retired from thence:  and many followed him, and he
healed them all.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.16">And he charged them that they should not make him known.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.17">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.18">Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul hath been
well pleased.  I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment
to the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.19">He shall not contend, nor cry out, neither shall any man hear his voice
in the streets.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.20">The bruised reed he shall not break:  and smoking flax he shall not
extinguish:  till he send forth judgment unto victory.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.21">And in his name the Gentiles shall hope.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.22">Then was offered to him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb:  and
he healed him, so that he spoke and saw.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.23">And all the multitudes were amazed, and said:  Is not this the son of David?

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.24">But the Pharisees hearing it, said:  This man casteth not out the devils
but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.25">And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said to them:  Every kingdom divided
against itself shall be made desolate:  and every city or house divided
against itself shall not stand.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.26">And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself:  how then
shall his kingdom stand?

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.27">And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them
out?  Therefore they shall be your judges.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.28">But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of God
come upon you.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.29">Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong, and rifle his
goods, unless he first bind the strong?  and then he will rifle his house.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.30">He that is not with me, is against me:  and he that gathereth not with me,
scattereth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.31">Therefore I say to you:  Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men,
but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.32">And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him:  but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not
be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.33">Either make the tree good and its fruit good:  or make the tree evil, and
its fruit evil.  For by the fruit the tree is known.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.34">O generation of vipers, how can you speak good things, whereas you are
evil?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.35">A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things:  and an evil
man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.36">But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall
render an account for it in the day of judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.37">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
condemned.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.38">Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying:  Master we
would see a sign from thee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.39">Who answering said to them:  An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a
sign:  and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.40">For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights:  so
shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three
nights.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.41">The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall
condemn it:  because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas.  And
behold a greater than Jonas here.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.42">The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and
shall condemn it:  because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the
wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon here.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.43">And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry
places seeking rest, and findeth none.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.44">Then he saith:  I will return into my house from whence I came out.  And
coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.45">Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than
himself, and they enter in and dwell there:  and the last state of that man
in made worse than the first.  So shall it be also to this wicked
generation.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.46">As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his
brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.47">And one said unto him:  Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without,
seeking thee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.48">But he answering him that told him, said:  Who is my mother, and who are
my brethren?

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.49">And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said:  Behold my
mother and my brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N1.12.50">For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is
my brother, and sister, and mother.

               <head>Chapter 13</head>
               <p n="N1.13.1">The same day Jesus going out of the house, sat by the sea side.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.2">And great multitudes were gathered unto him, so that he went up into a
boat and sat:  and all the multitude stood on the shore.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.3">And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying:  Behold the sower
went forth to sow.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.4">And whilst he soweth some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air
came and ate them up.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.5">And other some fell upon stony ground, where they had not much earth:
and they sprung up immediately, because they had no deepness of earth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.6">And when the sun was up they were scorched:  and because they had not root,
they withered away.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.7">And others fell among thorns:  and the thorns grew up and choked them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.8">And others fell upon good ground:  and they brought forth fruit, some an
hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.9">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.10">And his disciples came and said to him:  Why speakest thou to them in
parables?

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.11">Who answered and said to them:  Because to you it is given to know the
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven:  but to them it is not given.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.12">For he that hath, to him shall be given, and he shall abound:  but he that
hath not, from him shall be taken away that also which he hath.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.13">Therefore do I speak to them in parables:  because seeing they see not,
and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.14">And the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled in them, who saith:  By hearing
you shall hear, and shall not understand:  and seeing you shall see, and
shall not perceive.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.15">For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears they have
been dull of hearing, and their eyes they have shut:  lest at any time
they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.16">But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they
hear.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.17">For, amen, I say to you, many prophets and just men have desired to see
the things that you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things
that you hear and have not heard them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.18">Hear you therefore the parable of the sower.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.19">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not,
there cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his
heart:  this is he that received the seed by the way side.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.20">And he that received the seed upon stony ground, is he that heareth the
word, and immediately receiveth it with joy.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.21">Yet hath he not root in himself, but is only for a time:  and when there
ariseth tribulation and persecution because of the word, he is presently
scandalized.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.22">And he that received the seed among thorns, is he that heareth the word,
and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choketh up the
word, and he becometh fruitless.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.23">But he that received the seed upon good ground, is he that heareth the
word, and understandeth, and beareth fruit, and yieldeth the one an
hundredfold, and another sixty, and another thirty.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.24">Another parable he proposed to them, saying:  The kingdom of heaven is
likened to a man that sowed good seeds in his field.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.25">But while men were asleep, his enemy came and oversowed cockle among the
wheat and went his way.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.26">And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then
appeared also the cockle.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.27">And the servants of the goodman of the house coming said to him:  Sir,
didst thou not sow good seed in thy field?  whence then hath it cockle?

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.28">And he said to them:  An enemy hath done this.  And the servants said to
him:  Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.29">And he said:  No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the
wheat also together with it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.30">Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I
will say to the reapers:  Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into
bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.31">Another parable he proposed unto them, saying:  The kingdom of heaven is
like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.32">Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is
greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air
come, and dwell in the branches thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.33">Another parable he spoke to them:  The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven,
which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was
leavened.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.34">All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes:  and without
parables he did not speak to them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.35">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:  I
will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the
foundation of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.36">Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his
disciples came to him, saying:  Expound to us the parable of the cockle of
the field.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.37">Who made answer and said to them:  He that soweth the good seed, is the
Son of man.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.38">And the field, is the world.  And the good seed are the children of
the kingdom.  And the cockle, are the children of the wicked one.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.39">And the enemy that sowed them, is the devil.  But the harvest is the end of
the world.  And the reapers are the angels.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.40">Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire:  so shall it
be at the end of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.41">The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his
kingdom all scandals, and them that work iniquity.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.42">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:  there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.43">Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father.  He
that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.44">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field.  Which a
man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that
he hath, and buyeth that field.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.45">Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.46">Who when he had found one pearl of great price, went his way, and sold all
that he had, and bought it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.47">Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and
gathering together of all kind of fishes.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.48">Which, when it was filled, they drew out, and sitting by the shore, they
chose out the good into vessels, but the bad they cast forth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.49">So shall it be at the end of the world.  The angels shall go out, and shall
separate the wicked from among the just.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.50">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:  there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.51">Have ye understood all these things?  They say to him:  Yes.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.52">He said unto them:  Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of
heaven, is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of
his treasure new things and old.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.53">And it came to pass:  when Jesus had finished these parables, he passed
from thence.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.54">And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogues, so
that they wondered and said:  How came this man by this wisdom and
miracles?

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.55">Is not this the carpenter's son?  Is not his mother called Mary, and his
brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude:

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.56">And his sisters, are they not all with us?  Whence therefore hath he all
these things?

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.57">And they were scandalized in his regard.  But Jesus said to them:  A prophet
is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.

</p>
               <p n="N1.13.58">And he wrought not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.

               <p n="N1.14.1">At the time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.2">And he said to his servants:  This is John the Baptist:  he is risen from
the dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.3">For Herod had apprehended John and bound him, and put him into prison,
because of Herodias, his brother's wife.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.4">For John said to him:  It is not lawful for thee to have her.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.5">And having a mind to put him to death, he feared the people:  because they
esteemed him as a prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.6">But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them:  and
pleased Herod.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.7">Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask
of him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.8">But she being instructed before by her mother, said:  Give me here in a
dish the head of John the Baptist.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.9">And the king was struck sad:  yet because of his oath, and for them that
sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.10">And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.11">And his head was brought in a dish:  and it was given to the damsel, and
she brought it to her mother.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.12">And his disciples came and took the body, and buried it, and came and
told Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.13">Which when Jesus had heard, he retired from thence by boat, into a desert
place apart, and the multitudes having heard of it, followed him on foot
out of the cities.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.14">And he coming forth saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them,
and healed their sick.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.15">And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying:  This is a
desert place, and the hour is now past:  send away the multitudes, that
going into the towns, they may buy themselves victuals.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.16">But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go:  give you them to eat.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.17">They answered him:  We have not here, but five loaves, and two fishes.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.18">He said to them:  Bring them hither to me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.19">And when he had commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the grass, he
took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he
blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitudes.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.20">And they did all eat, and were filled.  And they took up what remained,
twelve full baskets of fragments.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.21">And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand men, besides women
and children.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.22">And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the boat, and to
go before him over the water, till he dismissed the people.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.23">And having dismissed the multitude, he went into a mountain alone to pray.
And when it was evening, he was there alone.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.24">But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves:  for the
wind was contrary.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.25">And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking upon the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.26">And they seeing him walk upon the sea, were troubled, saying:  It is an
apparition.  And they cried out for fear.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.27">And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying:  Be of good heart:  it is I,
fear ye not.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.28">And Peter making answer, said:  Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee
upon the waters.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.29">And he said:  Come.  And Peter going down out of the boat, walked upon the
water to come to Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.30">But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid:  and when he began to sink, he
cried out, saying:  Lord, save me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.31">And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and
said to him:  O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.32">And when they were come up into the boat, the wind ceased.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.33">And they that were in the boat came and adored him, saying:  Indeed thou
art the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.34">And having passed the water, they came into the country of Genesar.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.35">And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent into all
that country, and brought to him all that were diseased.

</p>
               <p n="N1.14.36">And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment.
And as many as touched, were made whole.

               <p n="N1.15.1">Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.2">Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients?  For they
wash not their hands when they eat bread.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.3">But he answering, said to them:  Why do you also transgress the commandment
of God for your tradition? For God said:

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.4">Honour thy father and mother:  And:  He that shall curse father or mother,
let him die the death.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.5">But you say:  Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever
proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.6">And he shall not honour his father or his mother:  and you have made void
the commandment of God for your tradition.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.7">Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.8">This people honoureth me with their lips:  but their heart is far from me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.9">And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.10">And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them:  Hear
ye and understand.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.11">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man:  but what cometh out of
the mouth, this defileth a man.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.12">Then came his disciples, and said to him:  Dost thou know that the
Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.13">But he answering them, said:  Every plant which my heavenly Father hath
not planted, shall be rooted up.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.14">Let them alone:  they are blind, and leaders of the blind.  And if the blind
lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.15">And Peter answering, said to him:  Expound to us this parable.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.16">But he said:  Are you also yet without understanding?

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.17">Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into
the belly, and is cast out into the privy?

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.18">But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart,
and those things defile a man.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.19">For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.20">These are the things that defile a man.  But to eat with unwashed hands
doth not defile a man.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.21">And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.22">And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out,
said to him:  Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David:  my daughter is
grieviously troubled by the devil.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.23">Who answered her not a word.  And his disciples came and besought him,
saying:  Send her away, for she crieth after us:

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.24">And he answering, said:  I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of
the house of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.25">But she came and adored him, saying:  Lord, help me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.26">Who answering, said:  It is not good to take the bread of the children,
and to cast it to the dogs.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.27">But she said:  Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall
from the table of their masters.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.28">Then Jesus answering, said to her:  O woman, great is thy faith:  be it done
to thee as thou wilt:  and her daughter was cured from that hour.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.29">And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of
Galilee.  And going up into a mountain, he sat there.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.30">And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the
blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others:  and they cast them down at
his feet, and he healed them:

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.31">So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk,
and the blind see:  and they glorified the God of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.32">And Jesus called together his disciples, and said:  I have compassion on
the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have
not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint
in the way.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.33">And the disciples say unto him:  Whence then should we have so many loaves
in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.34">And Jesus said to them:  How many loaves have you?  But they said:  Seven,
and a few little fishes.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.35">And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.36">And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake,
and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the people.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.37">And they did all eat, and had their fill.  And they took up seven baskets
full, of what remained of the fragments.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.38">And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women.

</p>
               <p n="N1.15.39">And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into
the coasts of Magedan.

asked him to shew them a sign from heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.2">But he answered and said to them:  When it is evening, you say, It will be
fair weather, for the sky is red.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.3">And in the morning:  To day there will be a storm, for the sky is red and

not know the signs of the times?

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.4">A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign:  and a sign shall

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.8">And Jesus knowing it, said:  Why do you think within yourselves, O ye of
little faith, for that you have no bread?

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.9">Do you not yet understand, neither do you remember the five loaves among
five thousand men, and how many baskets you took up?

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.11">Why do you not understand that it was not concerning the bread I said to
you:  Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.12">Then they understood that he said not that they should beware of the
leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.13">And Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi:  and he asked his
disciples, saying:  Whom do men say that the Son of man is?

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.14">But they said:  Some John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others
Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.17">And Jesus answering, said to him:  Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona:
because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who
is in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.18">And I say to thee:  That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will
build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against

               <p n="N1.16.19">And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.  And
whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in
heaven:  and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be
loosed also in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.20">Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no one that
he was Jesus the Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.21">From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must
go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the ancients and
scribes and chief priests, and be put to death, and the third day
rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.22">And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him, saying:  Lord, be it far

the things that are of men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.16.24">Then Jesus said to his disciples:  If any man will come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

</p>

his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.4">And Peter answering, said to Jesus:  Lord, it is good for us to be
here:  if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee,
and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.5">And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them.
And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying:  This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased:  hear ye him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.6">And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much
afraid.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.7">And Jesus came and touched them:  and said to them, Arise, and fear
not.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.8">And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.9">And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying:
Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.10">And his disciples asked him, saying:  Why then do the scribes say
that Elias must come first?

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.11">But he answering, said to them:  Elias indeed shall come, and restore
all things.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.12">But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not,
but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind.  So also the Son of
man shall suffer from them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.13">Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the
Baptist.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.14">And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling
down on his knees before him, saying:  Lord, have pity on my son, for
he is a lunatic, and suffereth much:  for he falleth often into the fire, and
often into the water.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.15">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.16">Then Jesus answered and said:  O unbelieving and perverse generation,
how long shall I be with you?  How long shall I suffer you?  bring him hither to
me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.17">And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the child
was cured from that hour.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.18">Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said:  Why could not
we cast him out?

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.19">Jesus said to them:  Because of your unbelief.  For, amen I say to you,
if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this
mountain, Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing
shall be impossible to you.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.20">But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.21">And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them:  The Son
of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.22">And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again.  And
they were troubled exceedingly.

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.24">He said:  Yes.  And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented
him, saying:  What is thy opinion, Simon?  The kings of the earth, of
whom do they receive tribute or custom?  of their own children, or of
strangers?

</p>
               <p n="N1.17.25">And he said:  Of strangers.  Jesus said to him:  Then the children are

him between thee and him alone.  If he shall hear thee, thou
shalt gain thy brother.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.16">And if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two
more:  that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
may stand.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.17">And if he will not hear them:  tell the church.  And if he
will not hear the church, let him be to thee as the heathen
and publican.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.18">Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth,
shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall
loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.19">Again I say to you, that if two of you shall consent upon
earth, concerning any thing whatsoever they shall ask, it
shall be done to them by my Father who is in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.20">For where there are two or three gathered together in my
name, there am I in the midst of them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.21">Then came Peter unto him and said:  Lord, how often shall my
brother offend against me, and I forgive him?  till seven times?

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.22">Jesus saith to him:  I say not to thee, till seven times; but
till seventy times seven times.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.23">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a king, who
would take an account of his servants.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.24">And when he had begun to take the account, one was brought
to him, that owed him ten thousand talents.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.25">And as he had not wherewith to pay it, his lord commanded that he
should be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment
to be made.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.26">But that servant falling down, besought him, saying:  Have
patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.27">And the lord of that servant being moved with pity, let him
go and forgave him the debt.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.28">But when that servant was gone out, he found one of his
fellow servants that owed him an hundred pence:  and laying
hold of him, throttled him, saying:  Pay what thou owest.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.29">And his fellow servant falling down, besought him, saying:
Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.30">And he would not:  but went and cast him into prison, till he
paid the debt.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.31">Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much
grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.32">Then his lord called him; and said to him:  Thou wicked
servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me:

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.33">Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy
fellow servant, even as I had compassion on thee?

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.34">And his lord being angry, delivered him to the torturers
until he paid all the debt.

</p>
               <p n="N1.18.35">So also shall my heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive
not every one his brother from your hearts.

               <p n="N1.19.1">And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these words, he
departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea,
beyond Jordan.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.2">And great multitudes followed him:  and he healed them
there.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.3">And there came to him the Pharisees tempting him, and
saying:  Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.4">Who answering, said to them:  Have ye not read, that he who
made man from the beginning, Made them male and female?  And
he said:

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.5">For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and
shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.6">Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh.  What
therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.7">They say to him:  Why then did Moses command to give a bill
of divorce, and to put away?

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.8">He saith to them:  Because Moses by reason of the hardness of
your heart permitted you to put away your wives:  but from
the beginning it was not so.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.9">And I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife,
except it be for fornication, and shall marry another,
committeth adultery:  and he that shall marry her that is put
away, committeth adultery.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.10">His disciples say unto him:  If the case of a man with his
wife be so, it is not expedient to marry.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.11">Who said to them:  All men take not this word, but they to
whom it is given.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.12">For there are eunuchs, who were born so from their mother's
womb:  and there are eunuchs, who were made so by men:  and
there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven.  He that can take, let him take it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.13">Then were little children presented to him, that he should
impose hands upon them and pray.  And the disciples rebuked them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.14">But Jesus said to them:  Suffer the little children, and
forbid them not to come to me:  for the kingdom of heaven is
for such.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.15">And when he had imposed hands upon them, he departed from
thence.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.16">And behold one came and said to him:  Good master, what good
shall I do that I may have life everlasting?

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.17">Who said to him:  Why asketh thou me concerning good?  One is
good, God.  But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.18">He said to him:  Which?  And Jesus said:  Thou shalt do no
murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not
steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.19">Honour thy father and thy mother:  and, Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.20">The young man saith to him:  All these I have kept from my
youth, what is yet wanting to me?

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.21">Jesus saith to him:  If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what
thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven:  and come follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.22">And when the young man had heard this word, he went away
sad:  for he had great possessions.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.23">Then Jesus said to his disciples:  Amen, I say to you, that a
rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.24">And again I say to you:  It is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter
into the kingdom of heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.25">And when they had heard this, the disciples wondered very
much, saying:  Who then can be saved?

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.26">And Jesus beholding, said to them:  With men this is
impossible:  but with God all things are possible.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.27">Then Peter answering, said to him:  Behold we have left all
things, and have followed thee:  what therefore shall we have?

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.28">And Jesus said to them:  Amen, I say to you, that you, who have
followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the
seat of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.29">And every one that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters,
or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my
name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall possess
life everlasting.

</p>
               <p n="N1.19.30">And many that are first, shall be last:  and the last shall be first.

               <p n="N1.20.1">The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went
out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.2">And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he
sent them into his vineyard.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.3">And going about the third hour, he saw others standing in
the market place idle.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.4">And he said to them:  Go you also into my vineyard, and I
will give you what shall be just.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.5">And they went their way.  And again he went out about the
sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.6">But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others
standing, and he saith to them:  Why stand you here all the
day idle?

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.7">They say to him:  Because no man hath hired us.  He saith to
them:  Go you also into my vineyard.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.8">And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to
his steward:  Call the labourers and pay them their hire,
beginning from the last even to the first.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.9">When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh
hour, they received every man a penny.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.10">But when the first also came, they thought that they should
receive more:  and they also received every man a penny.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.11">And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.12">Saying:  These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast
made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day
and the heats.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.13">But he answering said to one of them:  Friend, I do thee no
wrong:  didst thou not agree with me for a penny?

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.14">Take what is thine, and go thy way:  I will also give to this
last even as to thee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.15">Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will?  is thy eye
evil, because I am good?

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.16">So shall the last be first, and the first last.  For many are
called, but few chosen.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.17">And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples
apart, and said to them:

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.18">Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be
betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they
shall condemn him to death.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.19">And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and
scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.20">Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her
sons, adoring and asking something of him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.21">Who said to her:  What wilt thou?  She saith to him:  Say that
these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and
the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.22">And Jesus answering, said:  You know not what you ask.  Can
you drink the chalice that I shall drink?  They say to him:  We can.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.23">He saith to them:  My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to
sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you,
but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.24">And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against
the two brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.25">But Jesus called them to him, and said:  You know that the princes
of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are the greater, exercise
power upon them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.26">It shall not be so among you:  but whosoever will be the
greater among you, let him be your minister:

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.27">And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.28">Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto,
but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.29">And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude
followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.30">And behold two blind men sitting by the way side, heard that
Jesus passed by, and they cried out, saying:  O Lord, thou son of David,
have mercy on us.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.31">And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their
peace.  But they cried out the more, saying:  O Lord, thou son
of David, have mercy on us.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.32">And Jesus stood, and called them, and said:  What will ye
that I do to you?

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.33">They say to him:  Lord, that our eyes be opened.

</p>
               <p n="N1.20.34">And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes.  And
immediately they saw, and followed him.

               <p n="N1.21.1">And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and were come to
Bethphage, unto mount Olivet, then Jesus sent two disciples,

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.2">Saying to them:  Go ye into the village that is over against
you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt
with her:  loose them and bring them to me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.3">And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye, that the Lord hath
need of them:  and forthwith he will let them go.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.4">Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.5">Tell ye the daughter of Sion:  Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek,
and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to
the yoke.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.7">And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon
them, and made him sit thereon.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.8">And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way:  and
others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way:

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.9">And the multitudes that went before and that followed, cried, saying:
Hosanna to the son of David:  Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord:  Hosanna in the highest.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.10">And when he was come into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, saying:
Who is this?

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.11">And the people said:  This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.12">And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold
and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money
changers, and the chairs of them that sold doves:

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.13">And he saith to them:  It is written, My house shall be called the
house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.14">And there came to him the blind and the lame in the temple; and he
healed them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.15">And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things that he
did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying:  Hosanna to the
son of David; were moved with indignation.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.16">And said to him:  Hearest thou what these say?  And Jesus said to them:
Yea, have you never read:  Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings
thou hast perfected praise?

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.17">And leaving them, he went out of the city into Bethania, and remained
there.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.18">And in the morning, returning into the city, he was hungry.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.19">And seeing a certain fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and
found nothing on it but leaves only, and he saith to it:  May no fruit
grow on thee henceforward for ever.  And immediately the fig tree
withered away.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.20">And the disciples seeing it wondered, saying:  How is it presently
withered away?

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.21">And Jesus answering, said to them:  Amen, I say to you, if you shall
have faith, and stagger not, not only this of the fig tree shall you
do, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Take up and cast
thyself into the sea, it shall be done.

</p>

               <p n="N1.21.23">And when he was come into the temple, there came to him, as he was
teaching, the chief priests and ancients of the people, saying:  By what
authority dost thou these things?  and who hath given thee this authority?

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.24">Jesus answering, said to them:  I also will ask you one word, which if
you shall tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.25">The baptism of John, whence was it?  from heaven or from men?  But they
thought within themselves, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.26">If we shall say, from heaven, he will say to us:  Why then did you not
believe him?  But if we shall say, from men, we are afraid of the multitude:
for all held John as a prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.27">And answering Jesus, they said:  We know not.  He also said to them:
Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.28">But what think you?  A certain man had two sons; and coming to the
first, he said:  Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.29">And he answering, said:  I will not.  But afterwards, being moved with
repentance, he went.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.30">And coming to the other, he said in like manner.  And he answering,
said:  I go, Sir; and he went not.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.31">Which of the two did the father's will?  They say to him:  The first.
Jesus saith to them:  Amen I say to you, that the publicans and the
harlots shall go into the kingdom of God before you.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.32">For John came to you in the way of justice, and you did not believe
him.  But the publicans and the harlots believed him:  but you, seeing
it, did not even afterwards repent, that you might believe him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.33">Hear ye another parable.  There was a man an householder, who planted a
vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and dug in it a press, and
built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen; and went into a strange country.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.34">And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the
husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.35">And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed
another, and stoned another.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.36">Again he sent other servants more than the former; and they did to
them in like manner.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.37">And last of all he sent to them his son, saying:  They will reverence
my son.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.38">But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves:  This is the
heir:  come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.39">And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.40">When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to
those husbandmen?

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.41">They say to him:  He will bring those evil men to an evil end; and will
let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, that shall render him the fruit in
due season.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.42">Jesus saith to them:  Have you never read in the Scriptures:  The stone
which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?  By
the Lord this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.43">Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from
you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.44">And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken:  but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.45">And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they
knew that he spoke of them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.21.46">And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes:  because
they held him as a prophet.

               <head>Chapter 22</head>
               <p n="N1.22.1">And Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.2">The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for
his son.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.3">And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the
marriage; and they would not come.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.4">Again he sent other servants, saying:  Tell them that were invited,
Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed,
and all things are ready:  come ye to the marriage.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.5">But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and
another to his merchandise.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.6">And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them
contumeliously, put them to death.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.7">But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his
armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.8">Then he saith to his servants:  The marriage indeed is ready; but they
that were invited were not worthy.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.9">Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call
to the marriage.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.10">And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that
they found, both bad and good:  and the marriage was filled with guests.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.11">And the king went in to see the guests:  and he saw there a man who had
not on a wedding garment.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.12">And he saith to him:  Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a
wedding garment?  But he was silent.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.13">Then the king said to the waiters:  Bind his hands and feet, and cast
him into the exterior darkness:  there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.14">For many are called, but few are chosen.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.15">Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare
him in his speech.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.16">And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying:
Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of
God in truth, neither carest thou for any man:  for thou dost not
regard the person of men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.17">Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute
to Caesar, or not?

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.18">But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said:  Why do you tempt me, ye
hypocrites?

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.19">Shew me the coin of the tribute.  And they offered him a penny.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.20">And Jesus saith to them:  Whose image and inscription is this?

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.21">They say to him:  Caesar's.  Then he saith to them:  Render therefore to
Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God, the things that are God's.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.22">And hearing this they wondered, and leaving him, went their ways.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.23">That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no
resurrection; and asked him,

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.24">Saying:  Master, Moses said:  If a man die having no son, his brother
shall marry his wife, and raise up issue to his brother.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.25">Now there were with us seven brethren:  and the first having married a
wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.26">In like manner the second, and the third, and so on to the seventh.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.27">And last of all the woman died also.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.28">At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be?
for they all had her.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.29">And Jesus answering, said to them:  You err, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.30">For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married; but
shall be as the angels of God in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.31">And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that
which was spoken by God, saying to you:

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.33">And the multitudes hearing it, were in admiration at his doctrine.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.34">But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came
together:

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.35">And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him:

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.36">Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.37">Jesus said to him:  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole
heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.38">This is the greatest and the first commandment.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.39">And the second is like to this:  Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.40">On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.41">And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.42">Saying:  What think you of Christ?  whose son is he?  They say to him:
David's.

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.43">He saith to them:  How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.44">The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy
enemies thy footstool?

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.45">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

</p>
               <p n="N1.22.46">And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from
that day forth ask him any more questions.

               <head>Chapter 23</head>
               <p n="N1.23.1">Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.2">Saying:  The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of
Moses.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.3">All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do:
but according to their works do ye not; for they say, and do not.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.4">For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens, and lay them on men's
shoulders; but with a finger of their own they will not move them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.5">And all their works they do for to be seen of men.  For they make their
phylacteries broad, and enlarge their fringes.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.6">And they love the first places at feasts, and the first chairs in the
synagogues,

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.7">And salutations in the market place, and to be called by men, Rabbi.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.8">But be not you called Rabbi.  For one is your master; and all you are
brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.9">And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is
in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.10">Neither be ye called masters; for one is you master, Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.11">He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.12">And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled:  and he that shall
humble himself shall be exalted.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.13">But woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you shut the
kingdom of heaven against men, for you yourselves do not enter in; and
those that are going in, you suffer not to enter.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.14">Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites:  because you devour the
houses of widows, praying long prayers.  For this you shall receive the
greater judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.15">Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you go round
about the sea and the land to make one proselyte; and when he is made,
you make him the child of hell twofold more than yourselves.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.16">Woe to you blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the
temple, it is nothing; but he that shall swear by the gold of the temple, is
a debtor.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.17">Ye foolish and blind; for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple
that sanctifieth the gold?

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.18">And whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever

sanctifieth the gift?

</p>

things that are upon it:

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.21">And whosoever shall swear by temple, sweareth by it, and by him that

him that sitteth thereon.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.23">Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you tithe mint,

the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within you are full of

               <p n="N1.23.26">Thou blind Pharisee, first make clean the inside of the cup and of the
dish, that the outside may become clean.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.27">Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you are like to
whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear to men beautiful, but within
are full of dead men's bones, and of all filthiness.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.28">So you also outwardly indeed appear to men just; but inwardly you are
full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.29">Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; that build the
sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the just,

               <p n="N1.23.30">And say:  If we had been in the days of our Fathers, we would not have

of them that killed the prophets.

and some of them you will put to death and crucify, and some you will
scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:

</p>
               <p n="N1.23.35">That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the

children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and
thou wouldest not?

marrying and giving in marriage, even till that day in which Noe
entered into the ark,

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.39">And they knew not till the flood came, and took them all away; so also
shall the coming of the Son of man be.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.40">Then two shall be in the field:  one shall be taken, and one shall be
left.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.41">Two women shall be grinding at the mill:  one shall be taken, and one
shall be left.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.42">Watch ye therefore, because ye know not what hour your Lord will come.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.43">But know this ye, that if the goodman of the house knew at what hour
the thief would come, he would certainly watch, and would not suffer
his house to be broken open.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.44">Wherefore be you also ready, because at what hour you know not the Son
of man will come.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.45">Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
appointed over his family, to give them meat in season.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.46">Blessed is that servant, whom when his lord shall come he shall find
so doing.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.47">Amen I say to you, he shall place him over all his goods.

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.48">But if that evil servant shall say in his heart:  My lord is long a
coming:

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.49">And shall begin to strike his fellow servants, and shall eat and drink
with drunkards:

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.50">The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he hopeth not, and
at an hour that he knoweth not:

</p>
               <p n="N1.24.51">And shall separate him, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

               <head>Chapter 25</head>
               <p n="N1.25.1">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking
their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.2">And five of them were foolish, and five wise.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.3">But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with
them:

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.4">But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.5">And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.6">And at midnight there was a cry made:  Behold the bridegroom cometh, go
ye forth to meet him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.7">Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.8">And the foolish said to the wise:  Give us of your oil, for our lamps
are gone out.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.9">The wise answered, saying:  Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and
for you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.10">Now whilst they went to buy, the bridegroom came:  and they that were
ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.11">But at last come also the other virgins, saying:  Lord, Lord, open to us.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.12">But he answering said:  Amen I say to you, I know you not.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.13">Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.14">For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and
delivered to them his goods;

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.15">And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another
one, to every one according to his proper ability:  and immediately he
took his journey.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.16">And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded
with the same, and gained other five.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.17">And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.18">But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth,
and hid his lord's money.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.19">But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned
with them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.20">And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five
talents, saying:  Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I
have gained other five over and above.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.21">His lord said to him:  Well done, good and faithful servant, because
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many
things:  enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.22">And he also that had received the two talents came and said:  Lord,
thou deliveredst two talents to me:  behold I have gained other two.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.23">His lord said to him:  Well done, good and faithful servant:  because
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many
things:  enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.24">But he that had received the one talent, came and said:  Lord, I know
that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and
gatherest where thou hast not strewed.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.25">And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth:  behold here
thou hast that which is thine.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.26">And his lord answering, said to him:  Wicked and slothful servant, thou
knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed:

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.27">Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and
at my coming I should have received my own with usury.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.28">Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that
hath ten talents.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.29">For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound:  but
from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be
taken away.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.30">And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.31">And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.32">And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall
separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the
goats:

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.33">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.34">Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand:  Come,
ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.35">For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave
me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.36">Naked, and you covered me:  sick, and you visited me:  I was in prison,
and you came to me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.37">Then shall the just answer him, saying:  Lord, when did we see thee
hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.38">And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in?  or naked, and
covered thee?

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.39">Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.40">And the king answering, shall say to them:  Amen I say to you, as long
as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.41">Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand:  Depart
from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the
devil and his angels.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.42">For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat:  I was thirsty, and you
gave me not to drink.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.43">I was a stranger, and you took me not in:  naked, and you covered me
not:  sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.44">Then they also shall answer him, saying:  Lord, when did we see thee
hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did
not minister to thee?

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.45">Then he shall answer them, saying:  Amen I say to you, as long as you
did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.25.46">And these shall go into everlasting punishment:  but the just, into
life everlasting.

               <head>Chapter 26</head>
               <p n="N1.26.1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to
his disciples:

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.2">You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man
shall be delivered up to be crucified:

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.3">Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the
people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.4">And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend
Jesus, and put him to death.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.5">But they said:  Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a
tumult among the people.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.6">And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.7">There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious
ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.8">And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying:  To what purpose
is this waste?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.9">For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.10">And Jesus knowing it, said to them:  Why do you trouble this woman?  for
she hath wrought a good work upon me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.11">For the poor you have always with you:  but me you have not always.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.12">For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my
burial.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.13">Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the
whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.14">Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the
chief priests,

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.15">And said to them:  What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto
you?  But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.16">And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.17">And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus,
saying:  Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.18">But Jesus said:  Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him:
the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch
with my disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.19">And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared
the pasch.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.20">But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.21">And whilst they were eating, he said:  Amen I say to you, that one of
you is about to betray me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.22">And they being very much troubled, began every one to say:  Is it I,
Lord?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.23">But he answering, said:  He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish,
he shall betray me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.24">The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him:  but woe to that
man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed:  it were better for him,
if that man had not been born.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.25">And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said:  Is it I, Rabbi?  He saith
to him:  Thou hast said it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.26">And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and
broke:  and gave to his disciples, and said:  Take ye, and eat.  This is
my body.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.27">And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying:
Drink ye all of this.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.28">For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for
many unto remission of sins.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.29">And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of
the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the
kingdom of my Father.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.30">And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.31">Then Jesus said to them:  All you shall be scandalized in me this
night.  For it is written:  I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of
the flock shall be dispersed:

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.32">But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.33">And Peter answering, said to him:  Although all shall be scandalized in
thee, I will never be scandalized.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.34">Jesus said to him:  Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the
cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.35">Peter saith to him:  Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not
deny thee.  And in like manner said all the disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.36">Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called
Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples:  Sit you here, till I go
yonder and pray.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.37">And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to
grow sorrowful and to be sad.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.38">Then he saith to them:  My soul is sorrowful even unto death:  stay you
here, and watch with me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.39">And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and
saying:  My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me.
Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.40">And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith
to Peter:  What?  Could you not watch one hour with me?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.41">Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation.  The spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.42">Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying:  My Father, if this
chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.43">And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping:  for their eyes were
heavy.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.44">And leaving them, he went again:  and he prayed the third time, saying
the selfsame word.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.45">Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them:  Sleep ye now and
take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall
be betrayed into the hands of sinners.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.46">Rise, let us go:  behold he is at hand that will betray me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.47">As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a
great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and
the ancients of the people.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.48">And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying:  Whomsoever I shall
kiss, that is he, hold him fast.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.49">And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said:  Hail, Rabbi.  And he kissed
him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.50">And Jesus said to him:  Friend, whereto art thou come?  Then they came
up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.51">And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his
hand, drew out his sword:  and striking the servant of the high priest,
cut off his ear.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.52">Then Jesus saith to him:  Put up again thy sword into its place:  for
all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.53">Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me
presently more than twelve legions of angels?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.54">How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.55">In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes:  You are come out as it
were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me.  I sat daily
with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.56">Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be
fulfilled.  Then the disciples all leaving him, fled.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.57">But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the
scribes and the ancients were assembled.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.58">And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest.
And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.59">And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness
against Jesus, that they might put him to death:

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.60">And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in.  And last
of all there came two false witnesses:

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.61">And they said:  This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God,
and after three days to rebuild it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.62">And the high priest rising up, said to him:  Answerest thou nothing to
the things which these witness against thee?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.63">But Jesus held his peace.  And the high priest said to him:  I adjure
thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the
Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.64">Jesus saith to him:  Thou hast said it.  Nevertheless I say to you,
hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.65">Then the high priests rent his garments, saying:  He hath blasphemed;
what further need have we of witnesses?  Behold, now you have heard the
blasphemy:

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.66">What think you?  But they answering, said:  He is guilty of death.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him:  and others struck
his face with the palms of their hands,

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.68">Saying:  Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.69">But Peter sat without in the court:  and there came to him a servant
maid, saying:  Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.70">But he denied before them all, saying:  I know not what thou sayest.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.71">And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to
them that were there:  This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.72">And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.73">And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter:
Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.74">Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man.  And
immediately the cock crew.

</p>
               <p n="N1.26.75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said:  Before the
cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.  And going forth, he wept bitterly.

               <p n="N1.27.1">And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the
people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.2">And they brought him bound, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the
governor.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting
himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and
ancients,

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.4">Saying:  I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.  But they said:  What
is that to us?  look thou to it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.5">And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed:  and went and
hanged himself with an halter.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.6">But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said:  It is
not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.7">And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the
potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.8">For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of
blood, even to this day.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet,
saying:  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him
that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.10">And they gave them unto the potter's field, as the Lord appointed to
me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.11">And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him,
saying:  Art thou the king of the Jews?  Jesus saith to him:  Thou sayest it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered
nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.13">Then Pilate saith to him:  Dost not thou hear how great testimonies
they allege against thee?

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.14">And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered
exceedingly.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.15">Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the
people one prisoner, whom they would.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.16">And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.17">They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said:  Whom will you
that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.19">And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him,
saying:  Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have
suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.20">But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they
should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.21">And the governor answering, said to them:  Whether will you of the two
to be released unto you?  But they said, Barabbas.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.22">Pilate saith to them:  What shall I do then with Jesus that is called
Christ?  They say all:  Let him be crucified.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.23">The governor said to them:  Why, what evil hath he done?  But they cried
out the more, saying:  Let him be crucified.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.24">And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult
was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying:  I
am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.25">And the whole people answering, said:  His blood be upon us and our
children.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.26">Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus,
delivered him unto them to be crucified.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.27">Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered
together unto him the whole band;

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.28">And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.29">And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed
in his right hand.  And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him,
saying:  Hail, king of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.30">And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.31">And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and
put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.32">And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon:  him they
forced to take up his cross.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.33">And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place
of Calvary.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.34">And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall.  And when he had
tasted, he would not drink.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.35">And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting
lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
saying:  They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they
cast lots.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.36">And they sat and watched him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.37">And they put over his head his cause written:  THIS IS JESUS THE KING
OF THE JEWS.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.38">Then were crucified with him two thieves:  one on the right hand, and
one on the left.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.39">And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads,

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.40">And saying:  Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three
days dost rebuild it:  save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God,
come down from the cross.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.41">In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients,
mocking, said:

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.42">He saved others; himself he cannot save.  If he be the king of Israel,
let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.43">He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he
said:  I am the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.44">And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with
him, reproached him with.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until
the ninth hour.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying:  Eli,
Eli, lamma sabacthani?  that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.47">And some that stood there and heard, said:  This man calleth Elias.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.48">And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with
vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.49">And the others said:  Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
deliver him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.50">And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.51">And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to
the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.52">And the graves were opened:  and many bodies of the saints that had
slept arose,

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.53">And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy
city, and appeared to many.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.54">Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having
seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid,
saying:  Indeed this was the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.55">And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from
Galilee, ministering unto him:

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.56">Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph,
and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.57">And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea,
named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.58">He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.  Then Pilate commanded
that the body should be delivered.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.59">And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.60">And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock.
And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.61">And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over
against the sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.62">And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief
priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.63">Saying:  Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was
yet alive:  After three days I will rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.64">Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day:
lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the
people:  He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse
than the first.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.65">Pilate saith to them:  You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.

</p>
               <p n="N1.27.66">And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and
setting guards.

               <head>Chapter 28</head>
               <p n="N1.28.1">And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first
day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the
sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.2">And behold there was a great earthquake.  For an angel of the Lord
descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.3">And his countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.4">And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror, and became as
dead men.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.5">And the angel answering, said to the women:  Fear not you; for I know
that you seek Jesus who was crucified.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.6">He is not here, for he is risen, as he said.  Come, and see the place
where the Lord was laid.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.7">And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen:  and behold
he will go before you into Galilee; there you shall see him.  Lo, I
have foretold it to you.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.8">And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy,
running to tell his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.9">And behold Jesus met them, saying:  All hail.  But they came up and took
hold of his feet, and adored him.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.10">Then Jesus said to them:  Fear not.  Go, tell my brethren that they go
into Galilee, there they shall see me.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.11">Who when they were departed, behold some of the guards came into the
city, and told the chief priests all things that had been done.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.12">And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel,
gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.13">Saying:  Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away when
we were asleep.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.14">And if the governor shall hear this, we will persuade him, and secure
you.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.15">So they taking the money, did as they were taught:  and this word was
spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.16">And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where
Jesus had appointed them.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.17">And seeing them they adored:  but some doubted.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.18">And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying:  All power is given to me in
heaven and in earth.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.19">Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N1.28.20">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:
and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.2">As it is written in Isaias the prophet:  Behold I send my angel before
thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.3">A voice of one crying in the desert:  Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make straight his paths.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.4">John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of
penance, unto remission of sins.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.5">And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of
Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing
their sins.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.6">And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about
his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.7">And he preached, saying:  There cometh after me one mightier than I,
the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.8">I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.9">And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of
Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.10">And forthwith coming up out of he water, he saw the heavens opened,
and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.11">And there came a voice from heaven:  Thou art my beloved Son; in thee
I am well pleased.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.12">And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.13">And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted
by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.14">And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.15">And saying:  The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at
hand:  repent, and believe the gospel.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.16">And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his
brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen).

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.17">And Jesus said to them:  Come after me, and I will make you to become
fishers of men.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.18">And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.19">And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of
Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the
ship:

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.20">And forthwith he called them.  And leaving their father Zebedee in the
ship with his hired men, they followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.21">And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath
days going into the synagogue, he taught them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.22">And they were astonished at his doctrine.  For he was teaching them as
one having power, and not as the scribes.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.23">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he
cried out,

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.24">Saying:  What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth?  art thou
come to destroy us?  I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.25">And Jesus threatened him, saying:  Speak no more, and go out of the
man.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.26">And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice,
went out of him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
themselves, saying:  What thing is this?  what is this new doctrine?  for
with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.28">And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of
Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.29">And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house
of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.30">And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever:  and forthwith they
tell him of her.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.31">And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and
immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.32">And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that
were ill and that were possessed with devils.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.34">And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he
cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew
him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.35">And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place:  and
there he prayed.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.36">And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.37">And when they had found him, they said to him:  All seek for thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.38">And he saith to them:  Let us go into the neighbouring towns and
cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.39">And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and
casting out devils.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.40">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said
to him:  If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.41">And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and
touching him, saith to him:  I will.  Be thou made clean.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.42">And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him,
and he was made clean.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.43">And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.44">And he saith to him:  See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to
the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses
commanded, for a testimony to them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.1.45">But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word:
so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert
places:  and they flocked to him from all sides.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.2">And it was heard that he was in the house, and many came together, so
that there was no room; no, not even at the door; and he spoke to them the
word.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.3">And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was
carried by four.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.4">And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they
uncovered the roof where he was; and opening it, they let down the bed
wherein the man sick of the palsy lay.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.5">And when Jesus had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the
palsy:  Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.6">And there were some of the scribes sitting there, and thinking in
their hearts:

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.7">Why doth this man speak thus?  he blasphemeth.  Who can forgive sins,
but God only?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.8">Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit, that they so thought
within themselves, saith to them:  Why think you these things in your
hearts?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.9">Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy:  Thy sins are
forgiven thee; or to say:  Arise, take up thy bed, and walk?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.10">But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.11">I say to thee:  Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.12">And immediately he arose; and taking up his bed, went his way in the
sight of all; so that all wondered and glorified God, saying:  We never saw
the like.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.13">And he went forth again to the sea side; and all the multitude came
to him, and he taught them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.14">And when he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at
the receipt of custom; and he saith to him:  Follow me.  And rising up, he
followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.15">And it came to pass, that as he sat at meat in his house, many
publicans and sinners sat down together with Jesus and his disciples.  For
they were many, who also followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.16">And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with publicans
and sinners, said to his disiples:  Why doth your master eat and drink with
publicans and sinners?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.17">Jesus hearing this, saith to them:  They that are well have no need of
a physician, but they that are sick.  For I came not to call the just, but
sinners.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.18">And the disiples of John and the Pharisees used to fast; and they
come and say to him:  Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast;
but thy disciples do not fast?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.19">And Jesus saith to them:  Can the children of the marriage fast, as
long as the bridegroom is with them?  As long as they have the bridegroom
with them, they cannot fast.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.20">But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from
them; and then they shall fast in those days.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.21">No man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment:  otherwise the
new piecing taketh away from the old, and there is made a greater rent.

</p>

burst the bottles, and both the wine will be spilled, and the bottles will
be lost.  But new wine must be put into new bottles.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.23">And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked through the corn fields
on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go forward, and to pluck the
ears of corn.

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.24">And the Pharisees said to him:  Behold, why do they on the sabbath day
that which is not lawful?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.25">And he said to them:  Have you never read what David did when he had
need, and was hungry himself, and they that were with him?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.26">How he went into the house of God, under Abiathar the high priest,
and did eat the loaves of proposition, which was not lawful to eat but for
the priests, and gave to them who were with him?

</p>
               <p n="N2.2.27">And he said to them:  The sabbath was made for man, and not man for
the sabbath.

who had a withered hand.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.4">And he saith to them:  Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or
to do evil?  to save life, or to destroy?  But they held their peace.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.5">And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the

And he stretched it forth:  and his hand was restored unto him.

multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.8">And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan.  And
they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he
did, came to him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.9">And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him
because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.10">For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him,
as many as had evils.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.11">And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him:  and
they cried, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.12">Thou art the Son of God.  And he strictly charged them that they
should not make him known.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.13">And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would
himself:  and they came to him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.14">And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send
them to preach.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.15">And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.16">And to Simon he gave the name Peter:

him.  For they said:  He is become mad.

Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.

</p>
               <p n="N2.3.23">And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables:
How can Satan cast out Satan?

was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship, and sat in
the sea; and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.2">And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his
doctrine:

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.3">Hear ye:  Behold, the sower went out to sow.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.4">And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the
air came and ate it up.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.5">And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth;
and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.6">And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no
root, it withered away.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.7">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it,
and it yielded no fruit.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.8">And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew
up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a
hundred.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.9">And he said:  He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.10">And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the
parable.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.11">And he said to them:  To you it is given to know the mystery of the
kingdom of God:  but to them that are without, all things are done in
parables:

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.12">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may
hear, and not understand:  lest at any time they should be converted, and
their sins should be forgiven them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.13">And he saith to them:  Are you ignorant of this parable?  and how shall
you know all parables?

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.14">He that soweth, soweth the word.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.15">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as
soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word
that was sown in their hearts.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.16">And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground:  who
when they have heard the word, immediately recieve it with joy.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.17">And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time:
and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are
presently scandalized.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.18">And others there are who are sown among thorns:  these are they that
hear the word,

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.19">And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the
lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made
fruitless.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.20">And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the
word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and
another a hundred.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.21">And he said to them:  Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or
under a bed?  and not to be set on a candlestick?

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.22">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest:  neither
was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.24">And he said to them:  Take heed what you hear.  In what measure you
shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to
you.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.25">For he that hath, to him shall be given:  and he that hath not, that
also which he hath shall be taken away from him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.26">And he said:  So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed
into the earth,

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.27">And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should
spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.28">For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then
the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.29">And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the
sickle, because the harvest is come.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.30">And he said:  To what shall we liken the kingdom of God?  or to what
parable shall we compare it?

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.31">It is as a grain of mustard seed:  which when it is sown in the earth,
is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.32">And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all
herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may
dwell under the shadow thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.33">And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as
they were able to hear.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.34">And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he
explained all things to his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.35">And he saith to them that day, when evening was come:  Let us pass
over to the other side.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.36">And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the
ship:  and there were other ships with him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.37">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the
ship, so that the ship was filled.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.38">And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow;
and they awake him, and say to him:  Master, doth it not concern thee that
we perish?

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.39">And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea:  Peace, be
still.  And the wind ceased:  and there was made a great calm.

</p>
               <p n="N2.4.40">And he said to them:  Why are you fearful?  have you not faith yet?  And

enter into them.

               <p n="N2.5.13">And Jesus immediately gave them leave.  And the unclean spirits going out,
entered into the swine:  and the herd with great violence was carried headlong
into the sea, being about two thousand, and were stifled in the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.14">And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the fields.
And they went out to see what was done:

               <p n="N2.5.18">And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with the
devil, began to beseech him that he might be with him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.19">And he admitted him not, but saith to him:  Go into thy house to thy
friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath
had mercy on thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.20">And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things
Jesus had done for him:  and all men wondered.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.21">And when Jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait, a great
multitude assembled together unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.22">And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named Jairus:  and
seeing him, falleth down at his feet.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.23">And he besought him much, saying:  My daughter is at the point of death,
come, lay thy hand upon her, that she may be safe, and may live.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.24">And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they
thronged him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.25">And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years,

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.26">And had suffered many things from many physicians; and had spent all
that she had, and was nothing the better, but rather worse,

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.27">When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and touched
his garment.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.28">For she said:  If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.29">And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her
body that she was healed of the evil.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.30">And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had proceeded
from him, turning to the multitude, said:  Who hath touched my garments?

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.31">And his disciples said to him:  Thou seest the multitude thronging thee,
and sayest thou who hath touched me?

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.32">And he looked about to see her who had done this.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.33">But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her,
came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.34">And he said to her:  Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole:  go in
peace, and be thou whole of thy disease.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.35">While he was yet speaking, some come from the ruler of the synagogue's
house, saying:  Thy daughter is dead:  why dost thou trouble the master any
further?

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.36">But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the ruler of
the synagogue:  Fear not, only believe.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.37">And he admitted not any man to follow him, but Peter, and James, and John
the brother of James.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.38">And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he seeth a
tumult, and people weeping and wailing much.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.39">And going in, he saith to them:  Why make you this ado, and weep?  the
damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.40">And they laughed him to scorn.  But he having put them all out, taketh the
father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and
entereth in where the damsel was lying.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.41">And taking the damsel by the hand, he saith to her:  Talitha cumi, which
is, being interpreted:  Damsel (I say to thee) arise.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.42">And immediately the damsel rose up, and walked: and she was twelve years
old:  and they were astonished with a great astonishment.

</p>
               <p n="N2.5.43">And he charged them strictly that no man should know it:  and commanded
that something should be given her to eat.

               <p n="N2.6.1">And going out from thence, he went into his own country; and his
disciples followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.2">And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue:  and
many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine, saying:  How came this
man by all these things?  and what wisdom is this that is given to him, and
such mighty works as are wrought by his hands?

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and
Joseph, and Jude, and Simon?  are not also his sisters here with us?  And they
were scandalized in regard of him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.4">And Jesus said to them:  A prophet is not without honor, but in his own
country, and in his own house, and among his own kindred.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.5">And he could not do any miracles there, only that he cured a few that
were sick, laying his hands upon them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.6">And he wondered because of their unbelief, and he went through the
villages round about teaching.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.7">And he called the twelve; and began to send them two and two, and gave
them power over unclean spirits.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.8">And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a
staff only:  no scrip, no bread, nor money in their purse,

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.9">But to be shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.10">And he said to them:  Wheresoever you shall enter into an house, there
abide till you depart from that place.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.11">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you; going forth from
thence, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.12">And going forth they preached that men should do penance:

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.13">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick,
and healed them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.14">And king Herod heard, (for his name was made manifest,) and he said:
John the Baptist is risen again from the dead, and therefore mighty works
shew forth themselves in him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.15">And others said:  It is Elias.  But others said:  It is a prophet, as one
of the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.16">Which Herod hearing, said:  John whom I beheaded, he is risen again
from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.17">For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison
for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he had
married her.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.18">For John said to Herod:  It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's
wife.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.19">Now Herodias laid snares for him:  and was desirous to put him to death,
and could not.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.20">For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a just and holy man:  and kept
him, and when he heard him, did many things:  and he heard him willingly.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.21">And when a convenient day was come, Herod made a supper for his birthday,
for the princes, and tribunes, and chief men of Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.22">And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come in, and had danced,
and pleased Herod, and them that were at table with him, the king said to the
damsel:  Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.23">And he swore to her:  Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though
it be the half of my kingdom.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.24">Who when she was gone out, said to her mother, What shall I ask?  But she
said:  The head of John the Baptist.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.25">And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king, she asked,
saying:  I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish, the head of John the
Baptist.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.26">And the king was struck sad.  Yet because of his oath, and because of them
that were with him at table, he would not displease her:

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.27">But sending an executioner, he commanded that his head should be brought
in a dish.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.28">And he beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish:  and
gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.29">Which his disciples hearing came, and took his body, and laid it in a
tomb.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.30">And the apostles coming together unto Jesus, related to him all things
that they had done and taught.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.31">And he said to them:  Come apart into a desert place, and rest a little.
For there were many coming and going:  and they had not so much as time to
eat.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.32">And going up into a ship, they went into a desert place apart.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.33">And they saw them going away, and many knew:  and they ran flocking
thither on foot from all the cities, and were there before them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.34">And Jesus going out saw a great multitude:  and he had compassion on
them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach
them many things.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.35">And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, saying:
This is a desert place, and the hour is now past:

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.36">Send them away, that going into the next villages and towns, they may buy
themselves meat to eat.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.37">And he answering said to them:  Give you them to eat.  And they said to
him:  Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to
eat.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.38">And he saith to them:  How many loaves have you?  go and see.  And when
they knew, they say:  Five, and two fishes

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.39">And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by
companies upon the green grass.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.40">And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.41">And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes:  looking up to
heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to his disciples to set
before them:  and the two fishes he divided among them all.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.42">And they all did eat, and had their fill.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.43">And they took up the leavings, twelve full baskets of fragments, and of
the fishes.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.44">And they that did eat, were five thousand men.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.45">And immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship, that
they might go before him over the water to Bethsaida, whilst he dismissed the
people.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.46">And when he had dismissed them, he went up to the mountain to pray.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.47">And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself
alone on the land.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.48">And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,)
and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the
sea, and he would have passed by them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.49">But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition,
and they cried out.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.50">For they all saw him, and were troubled.  And immediately he spoke with
them, and said to them:  Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.51">And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased:  and they were
far more astonished within themselves:

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.52">For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was
blinded.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.53">And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and
set to the shore.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.54">And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him:

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.55">And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds
those that were sick, where they heard he was.

</p>
               <p n="N2.6.56">And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they
laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the
hem of his garment:  and as many as touched him were made whole.

               <head>Chapter 7</head>
               <p n="N2.7.1">And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the
scribes, coming from Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.2">And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that
is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.3">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews eat not without often washing their
hands, holding the tradition of the ancients:

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.4">And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not:
and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe,
the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.5">And the Pharisees and scribes asked him:  Why do not thy disciples walk
according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common
hands?

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.6">But he answering, said to them:  Well did Isaias prophesy of you
hypocrites, as it is written:  This people honoureth me with their lips, but
their heart is far from me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.7">And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.8">For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the
washing of pots and of cups:  and many other things you do like to these.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.9">And he said to them:  Well do you make void the commandment of God, that
you may keep your own tradition.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.10">For Moses said:  Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse
father or mother, dying let him die.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.11">But you say:  If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which
is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.12">And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.13">Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given
forth.  And many other such like things you do.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.14">And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them:  Hear ye me
all, and understand.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.15">There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile
him.  But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.16">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.17">And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples
asked him the parable.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.18">And he saith to them:  So are you also without knowledge?  understand you
not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.19">Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and
goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.20">But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a
man.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.21">For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, fornications, murders,

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.22">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye,
blasphemy, pride, foolishness.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.23">All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.24">And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon:  and
entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not
be hid.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.25">For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean
spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.26">For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born.  And she besought him
that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.27">Who said to her:  Suffer first the children to be filled:  for it is not
good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.28">But she answered and said to him:  Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat
under the table of the crumbs of the children.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.29">And he said to her:  For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of
thy daughter.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.30">And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the
bed, and that the devil was gone out.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.31">And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of
Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.32">And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he
would lay his hand upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.33">And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his
ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.34">And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him:  Ephpheta, which
is, Be thou opened.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.35">And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was
loosed, and he spoke right.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.36">And he charged them that they should tell no man.  But the more he
charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.

</p>
               <p n="N2.7.37">And so much the more did they wonder, saying:  He hath done all things
well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

               <p n="N2.8.1">In those days again, when there was a great multitude, and had nothing to
eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.2">I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with
me three days, and have nothing to eat.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.3">And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in
the way; for some of them came from afar off.

with bread in the wilderness?

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.5">And he asked them:  How many loaves have ye?  Who said:  Seven.

               <p n="N2.8.10">And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the
parts of Dalmanutha.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.11">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, asking him
a sign from heaven, tempting him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.12">And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith:  Why doth this generation seek a
sign?  Amen, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this generation.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.13">And leaving them, he went up again into the ship, and passed to the other
side of the water.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.14">And they forgot to take bread; and they had but one loaf with them in the
ship.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.15">And he charged them, saying:  Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.16">And they reasoned among themselves, saying:  Because we have no bread.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.17">Which Jesus knowing, saith to them:  Why do you reason, because you have
no bread?  do you not yet know nor understand?  have you still your heart
blinded?

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.18">Having eyes, see you not?  and having ears, hear you not?  neither do you
remember.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.19">When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full
of fragments took you up?  They say to him, Twelve.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.20">When also the seven loaves among four thousand, how many baskets of
fragments took you up?  And they say to him, Seven.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.21">And he said to them:  How do you not yet understand?

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.22">And they came to Bethsaida; and they bring to him a blind man, and they
besought him that he would touch him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.23">And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town; and
spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any
thing.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.24">And looking up, he said:  I see men as it were trees, walking.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.25">After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes, and he began to see, and
was restored, so that he saw all things clearly.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.26">And he sent him into his house, saying:  Go into thy house, and if thou
enter into the town, tell nobody.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.27">And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi.  And in the way, he asked his disciples, saying to them:  Whom do
men say that I am?

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.28">Who answered him, saying:  John the Baptist; but some Elias, and others
as one of the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.29">Then he saith to them:  But whom do you say that I am?  Peter answering
said to him:  Thou art the Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.30">And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.31">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
things, and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests, and the
scribes, and be killed:  and after three days rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.32">And he spoke the word openly.  And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.33">Who turning about and seeing his disciples, threatened Peter, saying:  Go
behind me, Satan, because thou savorest not the things that are of God, but
that are of men.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.34">And calling the multitude together with his disciples, he said to them:
If any man will follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.35">For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it:  and whosoever shall lose
his life for my sake and the gospel, shall save it.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.36">For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer
the loss of his soul?

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.37">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.38">For he that shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous
and sinful generation:  the Son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he
shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

</p>
               <p n="N2.8.39">And he said to them:  Amen I say to you, that there are some of them that
stand here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God coming
in power.

               <p n="N2.9.1">And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and
leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves, and was
transfigured before them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.2">And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow, so as no
fuller upon earth can make white.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.3">And there appeared to them Elias with Moses; and they were talking with
Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.4">And Peter answering, said to Jesus:  Rabbi, it is good for us to be here:
and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one
for Elias.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.5">For he knew not what he said:  for they were struck with fear.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.6">And there was a cloud overshadowing them:  and a voice came out of the
cloud, saying:  This is my most beloved son; hear ye him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.7">And immediately looking about, they saw no man any more, but Jesus only
with them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.8">And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any
man what things they had seen, till the Son of man shall be risen again from
the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.9">And they kept the word to themselves; questioning together what that
should mean, when he shall be risen from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.10">And they asked him, saying:  Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say
that Elias must come first?

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.11">Who answering, said to them:  Elias, when he shall come first, shall
restore all things; and as it is written of the Son of man, that he must
suffer many things and be despised.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.12">But I say to you, that Elias also is come, (and they have done to him
whatsoever they would,) as it is written of him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.13">And coming to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and
the scribes disputing with them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.14">And presently all the people seeing Jesus, were astonished and struck
with fear; and running to him, they saluted him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.15">And he asked them:  What do you question about among you?

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.16">And one of the multitude, answering, said:  Master, I have brought my
son to thee, having a dumb spirit.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.17">Who, wheresoever he taketh him, dasheth him, and he foameth, and
gnasheth with the teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples to cast
him out, and they could not.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.18">Who answering them, said:  O incredulous generation, how long shall I be
with you?  how long shall I suffer you?  bring him unto me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.19">And they brought him.  And when he had seen him, immediately the spirit
troubled him; and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.20">And he asked his father:  How long time is it since this hath happened
unto him?  But he said:  From his infancy:

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.21">And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into waters to destroy
him.  But if thou canst do any thing, help us, having compassion on us.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.22">And Jesus saith to him:  If thou canst believe, all things are possible
to him that believeth.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.23">And immediately the father of the boy crying out, with tears said:  I do
believe, Lord:  help my unbelief.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.24">And when Jesus saw the multitude running together, he threatened the
unclean spirit, saying to him:  Deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, go out
of him; and enter not any more into him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.25">And crying out, and greatly tearing him, he went out of him, and he
became as dead, so that many said:  He is dead.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.26">But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up; and he arose.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.27">And when he was come into the house, his disciples secretly asked him:
Why could not we cast him out?

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.28">And he said to them:  This kind can go out by nothing, but by prayer and
fasting.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.29">And departing from thence, they passed through Galilee, and he would
not that any man should know it.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.30">And he taught his disciple, and said to them:  The Son of man shall be
betrayed into the hands of men, and  they shall kill him; and after that he is
killed, he shall rise again the third day.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.31">But they understood not the word, and they were afraid to ask him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.32">And they came to Capharnaum.  And when they were in the house, he asked them:  What did you treat of in the way?

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.33">But they held their peace, for in the way they had disputed among
themselves, which of them should be the greatest.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.34">And sitting down, he called the twelve, and saith to them:  If any man
desire to be first, he shall be the last of all, and the minister of all.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.35">And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them.  Whom when he had
embraced, he saith to them:

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.36">Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name, receiveth
me.  And whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.37">John answered him, saying:  Master, we saw one casting out devils in
thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbade him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.38">But Jesus said:  Do not forbid him.  For there is no man that doth a
miracle in my name, and can soon speak ill of me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.39">For he that is not against you, is for you.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.40">For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name,
because you belong to Christ:  amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.41">And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in
me; it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and
he were cast into the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.42">And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off:  it is better for thee to
enter into life, maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into
unquenchable fire:

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.43">Where there worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.44">And if thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off.  It is better for thee to
enter lame into life everlasting, than having two feet, to be cast into the
hell of unquenchable fire:

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.45">Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.46">And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out.  It is better for thee
with one eye to enter into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be
cast into the hell of fire:

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.47">Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.48">For every one shall be salted with fire:  and every victim shall be salted with salt.

</p>
               <p n="N2.9.49">Salt is good.  But if the salt became unsavory; wherewith will you
season it?  Have salt in you, and have peace among you.

the Jordan:  and the multitudes flock to him again.  And as he was accustomed,
he taught them again.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.2">And the Pharisees coming to him asked him:  Is it lawful for a man to
put away his wife?  tempting him.

               <p n="N2.10.4">Who said:  Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to put her
away.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.5">To whom Jesus answering, said:  Because of the hardness of your heart he

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.10">And in the house again his disciples asked him concerning the same thing.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.11">And he saith to them:  Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry
another, committeth adultery against her.

kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.15">Amen I say to you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.18">And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good?  None is good but one,

from my youth.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.21">And Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him:  One thing is

thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

betrayed to the chief priests, and to the scribes and ancients, and they shall
condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.34">And they shall mock him, and spit on him, and scourge him, and kill him:
and the third day he shall rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.35">And James and John the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying:  Master, we
desire that whatsoever we shall ask, thou wouldst do it for us:

               <p n="N2.10.36">But he said to them:  What would you that I should do for you?

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.37">And they said:  Grant to us, that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and
the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.38">And Jesus said to them: You know not what you ask.  Can you drink of the
chalice that I drink of:  or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am
baptized?

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.39">But they said to him:  We can.  And Jesus saith to them:  You shall indeed
drink of the chalice that I drink of:  and with the baptism wherewith I am
baptized, you shall be baptized.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.40">But to sit on my right hand, or on my left, is not mine to give to you,

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.42">But Jesus calling them, saith to them:  You know that they who seem to
rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them:  and their princes have power over
them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.43">But it is not so among you:  but whosoever will be greater, shall be your

               <p n="N2.10.48">And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace; but he cried a great
deal the more:  Son of David, have mercy on me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.49">And Jesus, standing still, commanded him to be called.  And they call the
blind man, saying to him:  Be of better comfort:  arise, he calleth thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.50">Who casting off his garment leaped up, and came to him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.51">And Jesus answering, said to him:  What wilt thou that I should do to
thee?  And the blind man said to him:  Rabboni, that I may see.

</p>
               <p n="N2.10.52">And Jesus saith to him:  Go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole.  And
immediately he saw, and followed him in the way.

               <p n="N2.11.1">And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethania at the mount
of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.2">And saith to them:  Go into the village that is over against you, and
immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which
no man yet hath sat:  loose him, and bring him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.3">And if any man shall say to you, What are you doing?  say ye that the
Lord hath need of him:  and immediately he will let him come hither.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.4">And going their way, they found the colt tied before the gate without, in
the meeting of two ways:  and they loose him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.5">And some of them that stood there, said to them:  What do you loosing the
colt?

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.6">Who said to them as Jesus had commanded them; and they let him go with
them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.7">And they brought the colt to Jesus; and they lay their garments on him,
and he sat upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.8">And many spread their garments in the way:  and others cut down boughs
from the trees, and strewed them in the way.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.9">And they that went before and they that followed, cried, saying:
Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.11">And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple:  and having viewed all
things round about, when now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethania
with the twelve.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.12">And the next day when they came out from Bethania, he was hungry.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.13">And when he had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves, he came if
perhaps he might find any thing on it.  And when he was come to it, he found
nothing but leaves.  For it was not the time for figs.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.14">And answering he said to it:  May no man hereafter eat fruit of thee any
more for ever.  And his disciples heard it.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.15">And they came to Jerusalem.  And when he was entered into the temple, he
began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the
tables of the moneychangers, and the chairs of them that sold doves.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.16">And he suffered not that any man should carry a vessel through the temple;

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.17">And he taught, saying to them:  Is it not written, My house shall be
called the house of prayer to all nations?  But you have made it a den of
thieves.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.18">Which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard, they sought how
they might destroy him.  For they feared him, because the whole multitude was
in admiration at his doctrine.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.20">And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up
from the roots.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.21">And Peter remembering, said to him:  Rabbi, behold the fig tree, which
thou didst curse, is withered away.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.22">And Jesus answering, saith to them:  Have the faith of God.

               <p n="N2.11.25">And when you shall stand to pray, forgive, if you have aught against any
man; that your Father also, who is in heaven, may forgive you your sins.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.26">But if you will not forgive, neither will your Father that is in heaven,
forgive you your sins.

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.27">And they come again to Jerusalem.  And when he was walking in the temple,
there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients,

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.28">And they say to him:  By what authority dost thou these things?  and who
hath given thee this authority that thou shouldst do these things?

</p>

will say, Why then did you not believe him?

</p>
               <p n="N2.11.32">If we say, From men, we fear the people.  For all men counted John that
he was a prophet indeed.

</p>

saith to them:  Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

               <p n="N2.12.1">And he began to speak to them in parables:  A certain man planted a
vineyard and made a hedge about it, and dug a place for the winefat, and built
a tower, and let it to husbandmen; and went into a far country.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.2">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the
husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.3">Who having laid hands on him, beat him, and sent him away empty.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.4">And again he sent to them another servant; and him they wounded in the
head, and used him reproachfully.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.5">And again he sent another, and him they killed:  and many others, of whom
some they beat, and others they killed.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.6">Therefore having yet one son, most dear to him; he also sent him unto
them last of all, saying:  They will reverence my son.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.7">But the husbandmen said one to another:  This is the heir; come let us
kill him; and the inheritance shall be ours.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.8">And laying hold on him, they killed him, and cast him out of the
vineyard.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.9">What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do?  He will come and
destroy those husbandmen; and will give the vineyard to others.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.10">And have you not read this scripture, The stone which the builders
rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.11">By the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.12">And they sought to lay hands on him, but they feared the people.  For
they knew that he spoke this parable to them.  And leaving him, they went
their way.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.13">And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians; that they
should catch him in his words.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.14">Who coming, say to him:  Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and
carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest
the way of God in truth.  Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar; or shall we
not give it?

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.15">Who knowing their wiliness, saith to them:  Why tempt you me?  bring me a

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.17">And Jesus answering, said to them:  Render therefore to Caesar the things
that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.  And they marvelled
at him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.18">And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection;
and they asked him, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.19">Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if any man's brother die, and leave his
wife behind him, and leave no children, his brother should take his wife, and
raise up seed to his brother.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.20">Now there were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and died
leaving no issue.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.21">And the second took her, and died:  and neither did he leave any issue.
And the third in like manner.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.22">And the seven all took her in like manner; and did not leave issue.
Last of all the woman also died.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.23">In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife
shall she be of them?  for the seven had her to wife.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.24">And Jesus answering, saith to them:  Do ye not therefore err, because you
know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.25">For when they shall rise again from the dead, they shall neither marry,
nor be married, but are as the angels in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.26">And as concerning the dead that they rise again, have you not read in the
book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying:  I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.  You therefore do
greatly err.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.28">And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together,
and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first
commandment of all.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.29">And Jesus answered him:  The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel:
the Lord thy God is one God.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.30">And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with thy whole heart, and with thy
whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength.  This is the
first commandment.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.31">And the second is like to it:  Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
There is no other commandment greater than these.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.32">And the scribe said to him:  Well, Master, thou hast said in truth, that
there is one God, and there is no other besides him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.33">And that he should be loved with the whole heart, and with the whole
understanding, and with the whole soul, and with the whole strength; and to
love one's neighbour as one's self, is a greater thing than all holocausts and
sacrifices.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.34">And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him:  Thou art not
far from the kingdom of God.  And no man after that durst ask him any
question.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.35">And Jesus answering, said, teaching in the temple:  How do the scribes
say, that Christ is the son of David?

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.36">For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost:  The Lord said to my Lord, Sit
on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.37">David therefore himself calleth him Lord, and whence is he then his son?
And a great multitude heard him gladly.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.38">And he said to them in his doctrine:  Beware of the scribes, who love to
walk in long robes, and to be saluted in the marketplace,

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.39">And to sit in the first chairs, in the synagogues, and to have the
highest places at suppers:

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.40">Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long prayer:  these
shall receive greater judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.41">And Jesus sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast
money into the treasury, and many that were rich cast in much.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.42">And there came a certain poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which
make a farthing.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.43">And calling his disciples together, he saith to them:  Amen I say to you,
this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the
treasury.

</p>
               <p n="N2.12.44">For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want cast in
all she had, even her whole living.

Master, behold what manner of stones and what buildings are here.

</p>
               <p n="N2.13.2">And Jesus answering, said to him:  Seest thou all these great buildings?
There shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.

</p>
               <p n="N2.13.3">And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple, Peter and
James and John and Andrew asked him apart:

there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and famines.  These things are

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.4">Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said:  Why
was this waste of the ointment made?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.5">For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,
and given to the poor.  And they murmured against her.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.6">But Jesus said:  Let her alone, why do you molest her?  She hath wrought a
good work upon me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.7">For the poor you have always with you:  and whensoever you will, you may
do them good:  but me you have not always.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.8">She hath done what she could:  she is come beforehand to anoint my body
for burial.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.9">Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the
whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of
her.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.10">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to
betray him to them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.11">Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him
money.  And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.12">Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the
pasch, the disciples say to him:  Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for
thee to eat the pasch?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.13">And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them:  Go ye into the
city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.14">And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The
master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my
disciples?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.15">And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye
for us.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.16">And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found
as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.17">And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.18">And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith:  Amen I say to you,
one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.19">But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one:  Is it I?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.20">Who saith to them:  One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in
the dish.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.21">And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him:  but woe to that
man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed.  It were better for him, if that
man had not been born.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.22">And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and
gave to them, and said:  Take ye.  This is my body.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.23">And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them.  And
they all drank of it.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.24">And he said to them:  This is my blood of the new testament, which shall
be shed for many.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.25">Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,
until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.26">And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.27">And Jesus saith to them:  You will all be scandalized in my regard this
night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be
dispersed.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.28">But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.29">But Peter saith to him:  Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet
not I.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.30">And Jesus saith to him:  Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night,
before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.31">But he spoke the more vehemently:  Although I should die together with thee, I
will not deny thee.  And in like manner also said they all.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.32">And they came to a farm called Gethsemani.  And he saith to his
disciples:  Sit you here, while I pray.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.33">And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and
to be heavy.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.34">And he saith to them:  My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you
here, and watch.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.35">And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he
prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.36">And he saith:  Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee:  remove this
chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.37">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping.  And he saith to Peter:  Simon,
sleepest thou?  couldst thou not watch one hour?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.38">Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation.  The spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh is weak.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.39">A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.40">And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were
heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.41">And he cometh the third time, and saith to them:  Sleep ye now,
and take your rest.  It is enough:  the hour is come:  behold the Son of man
shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.42">Rise up, let us go.  Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.43">And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve:
and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests
and the scribes and the ancients.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.44">And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying:  Whomsoever I
shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.45">And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith:  Hail, Rabbi;
and he kissed him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.46">But they laid hands on him, and held him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.47">An one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the
chief priest, and cut off his ear.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.48">And Jesus answering, said to them:  Are you come out as to a robber, with
swords and staves to apprehend me?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.49">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on
me.  But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.50">Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.51">And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his
naked body; and they laid hold on him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.52">But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.53">And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the
scribes and the ancients assembled together.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.54">And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high
priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.55">And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against
Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.56">For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not
agreeing.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.57">And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.58">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within
three days I will build another not made with hands.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.59">And their witness did not agree.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.60">And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying:
Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.61">But he held his peace, and answered nothing.  Again the high priest asked
him, and said to him:  Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.62">And Jesus said to him:  I am.  And you shall see the Son of man sitting on
the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.63">Then the high priest rending his garments, saith:  What need we any
further witnesses?

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.64">You have heard the blasphemy.  What think you?  Who all condemned him to
be guilty of death.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.65">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him,
and to say unto him:  Prophesy:  and the servants struck him with the palms of
their hands.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.66">Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the
maidservants of the high priest.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.67">And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith:
Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.68">But he denied, saying:  I neither know nor understand what thou sayest.
And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.69">And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by:  This
is one of them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.70">But he denied again.  And after a while they that stood by said again to
Peter:  Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.71">But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom
you speak.

</p>
               <p n="N2.14.72">And immediately the cock crew again.  And Peter remembered the word that
Jesus had said unto him:  Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny
me.  And he began to weep.

               <head>Chapter 15</head>
               <p n="N2.15.1">And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation
with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led
him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.2">And Pilate asked him:  Art thou the king of the Jews?  But he answering,
saith to him:  Thou sayest it.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.3">And the chief priests accused him in many things.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.4">And Pilate again asked him, saying:  Answerest thou nothing?  behold in
how many things they accuse thee.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.5">But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.6">Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the
prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.7">And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some
seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.8">And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would
do, as he had ever done unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.9">And Pilate answered them, and said:  Will you that I release to you the
king of the Jews?

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.10">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.11">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release
Barabbas to them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.12">And Pilate again answering, saith to them:  What will you then that I do
to the king of the Jews?

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.13">But they again cried out:  Crucify him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.14">And Pilate saith to them:  Why, what evil hath he done?  But they cried
out the more:  Crucify him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.15">And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them
Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.16">And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they
called together the whole band:

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.17">And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put
it upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.18">And they began to salute him:  Hail, king of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.19">And they struck his head with a reed:  and they did spit on him.  And
bowing their knees, they adored him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.20">And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put
his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.21">And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the
country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.22">And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being
interpreted is, The place of Calvary.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.23">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.24">And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them,
what every man should take.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.26">And the inscription of his cause was written over:  THE KING OF THE JEWS.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.27">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the
other on his left.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.28">And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith:  And with the wicked he was
reputed.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.29">And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying:
Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up
again;

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.30">Save thyself, coming down from the cross.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.31">In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one
to another:  He saved others; himself he cannot save.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.32">Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see
and believe.  And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.33">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth
until the ninth hour.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.34">And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying:  Eloi,
Eloi, lamma sabacthani?  Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.35">And some of the standers by hearing, said:  Behold he calleth Elias.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.36">And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a
reed, gave him to drink, saying:  Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him
down.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.37">And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.38">And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.39">And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in
this manner he had given up the ghost, said:  Indeed this man was the son of
God.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.40">And there were also women looking on afar off:  among whom was Mary
Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome:

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.41">Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and
many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.42">And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is,
the day before the sabbath,)

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.43">Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for
the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of
Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.44">But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead.  And sending for the
centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.45">And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to
Joseph.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.46">And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the
fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock.  And he
rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N2.15.47">And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was
laid.

               <p n="N2.16.1">And  when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of
James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.2">And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to
the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.3">And they said one to another:  Who shall roll us back the stone from the
door of the sepulchre?

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.4">And looking, they saw the stone rolled back.  For it was very great.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.5">And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the
right side, clothed with a white robe:  and they were astonished.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.6">Who saith to them:  Be not affrighted;  you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who
was crucified:  he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid
him.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.7">But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into
Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.8">But they going out, fled from the sepulchre.  For a trembling and fear
had seized them:  and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.9">But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary
Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.10">She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and
weeping.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.11">And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not
believe.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.12">And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as
they were going into the country.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.13">And they going told it to the rest:  neither did they believe them.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.14">At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table:  and he
upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did
not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.15">And he said to them:  Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to
every creature.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.16">He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved:  but he that believeth
not shall be condemned.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.17">And these signs shall follow them that believe:  In my name they shall
cast out devils:  they shall speak with new tongues.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.18">They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall
not hurt them:  they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall
recover.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.19">And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into
heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God.

</p>
               <p n="N2.16.20">But they going forth preached every where:  the Lord working withal, and
confirming the word with signs that followed.

               <head>Chapter 1</head>
               <p n="N3.1.1">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of
the things that have been accomplished among us;

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.2">According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were
eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.3">It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from
the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.4">That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been
instructed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named
Zachary, of the course of Abia; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron,
and her name Elizabeth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.6">And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and
justifications of the Lord without blame.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.7">And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were
well advanced in years.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.8">And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order
of his course before God,

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.9">According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer
incense, going into the temple of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.10">And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of
incense.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.11">And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side
of the alter of incense.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.12">And Zachary seeing him, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.13">But the angel said to him:  Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard;
and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name
John:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.14">And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice in his
nativity.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.15">For he shall be great before the Lord; and shall drink no wine nor strong
drink:  and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's
womb.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.16">And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.17">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias; that he may
turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the incredulous to the
wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.18">And Zachary said to the angel:  Whereby shall I know this?  for I am an
old man, and my wife is advanced in years.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.19">And the angel answering, said to him:  I am Gabriel, who stand before God:
and am sent to speak to thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.20">And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak until the
day wherein these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my
words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.21">And the people were waiting for Zachary; and they wondered that he tarried
so long in the temple.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.22">And when he came out, he could not speak to them:  and they understood
that he had seen a vision in the temple.  And he made signs to them, and
remained dumb.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.23">And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he
departed to his own house.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.24">And after those days, Elizabeth  his wife conceived, and hid herself five
months, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.25">Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to
take away my reproach among men.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.26">And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
Galilee, called Nazareth,

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.27">To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.28">And the angel being come in, said unto her:  Hail, full of grace, the Lord
is with thee:  blessed art thou among women.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.29">Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself
what manner of salutation this should be.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.30">And the angel said to her:  Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with
God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.31">Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and
thou shalt call his name Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the
Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign
in the house of Jacob for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.33">And of his kingdom there shall be no end.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.34">And Mary said to the angel:  How shall this be done, because I know not
man?

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.35">And the angel answering, said to her:  The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee.  And therefore also
the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.36">And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old
age; and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.37">Because no word shall be impossible with God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.38">And Mary said:  Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me
according to thy word.  And the angel departed from her.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.39">And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste
into a city of Juda.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.40">And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.41">And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the
infant leaped in her womb.  And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.42">And she cried out with a loud voice, and said:  Blessed art thou among
women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.43">And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.44">For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the
infant in my womb leaped for joy.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.45">And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be
accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.46">And Mary said:  My soul doth magnify the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.47">And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.48">Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from
henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.49">Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is his
name.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.50">And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.51">He hath shewed might in his arm:  he hath scattered the proud in the
conceit of their heart.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.52">He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.53">He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent
empty away.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.54">He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.55">As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.56">And Mary abode with her about three months; and she returned to her own
house.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.57">Now Elizabeth's full time of being delivered was come, and she brought
forth a son.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.58">And her neighbours and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great
mercy towards her, and they congratulated with her.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.59">And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the
child, and they called him by his father's name Zachary.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.60">And his mother answering, said:  Not so; but he shall be called John.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.61">And they said to her:  There is none of thy kindred that is called by this
name.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.62">And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.63">And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying:  John is his name.  And
they all wondered.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.64">And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke,
blessing God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.65">And fear came upon all their neighbours; and all these things were noised
abroad over all the hill country of Judea.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.66">And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying:
What an one, think ye, shall this child be?  For the hand of the Lord was with
him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.67">And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost; and he prophesied,
saying:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.68">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; because he hath visited and wrought
the redemption of his people:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.69">And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his
servant:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.70">As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.71">Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.72">To perform mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy testament,

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.73">The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us,

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.74">That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him
without fear,

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.75">In holiness and justice before him, all our days.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.76">And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:  for thou
shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.77">To give knowledge of salvation to his people, unto the remission of their
sins:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.78">Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient from on
high hath visited us:

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.79">To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death:  to
direct our feet into the way of peace.

</p>
               <p n="N3.1.80">And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit; and was in the deserts
until the day of his manifestation to Israel.

               <head>Chapter 2</head>
               <p n="N3.2.1">And it came to pass, that in those days there went out a decree from
Caesar Augustus, that the whole world should be enrolled.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.2">This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.3">And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.4">And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into
Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem:  because he was of the
house and family of David,

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.5">To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.6">And it came to pass, that when they were there, her days were
accomplished, that she should be delivered.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.7">And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling
clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the
inn.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.8">And there were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the
night watches over their flock.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.9">And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God
shone round about them; and they feared with a great fear.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.10">And the angel said to them:  Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy, that shall be to all the people:

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.11">For, this day, is born to you a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the
city of David.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.12">And this shall be a sign unto you.  You shall find the infant wrapped in
swaddling clothes, and laid in a manger.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army,
praising God, and saying:

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.14">Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good will.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.15">And it came to pass, after the angels departed from them into heaven, the
shepherds said one to another:  Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see
this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.16">And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant
lying in the manger.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.17">And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them
concerning this child.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.18">And all that heard, wondered; and at those things that were told them by
the shepherds.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.19">But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.20">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the
things they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.21">And after eight days were accomplished, that the child should be
circumcised, his name was called JESUS, which was called by the angel, before
he was conceived in the womb.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.22">And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses,
were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.23">As it is written in the law of the Lord:  Every male opening the womb
shall be called holy to the Lord:

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.24">And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the
Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons:

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.25">And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was
just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Ghost was
in him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.26">And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see
death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.27">And he came by the Spirit into the temple.  And when his parents brought
in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.28">He also took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.29">Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word in peace;

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.30">Because my eyes have seen thy salvation,

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.31">Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples:

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.32">A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.33">And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were
spoken concerning him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.34">And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother:  Behold this child
is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign
which shall be contradicted;

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.35">And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts
may be revealed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.36">And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the
tribe of Aser;  she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her husband
seven years from her virginity.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.37">And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from
the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.38">Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of
him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.39">And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord,
they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.40">And the child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom; and the grace of God
was in him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.41">And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the
pasch,

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.42">And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according
to the custom of the feast,

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.43">And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus
remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.44">And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and
sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.45">And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.46">And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple,
sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.47">And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.48">And seeing him, they wondered.  And his mother said to him:  Son, why
hast thou done so to us?  behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.49">And he said to them:  How is it that you sought me?  did you not know,
that I must be about my father's business?

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.50">And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.51">And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to
them.  And his mother kept all these words in her heart.

</p>
               <p n="N3.2.52">And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.

               <p n="N3.3.1">Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate
being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his
brother tetrarch of Iturea, and the country of Trachonitis, and Lysanias
tetrarch of Abilina;

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.2">Under the high priests Annas and Caiphas; the word of the Lord was made
unto John, the son of Zachary, in the desert.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.3">And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the baptism
of penance for the remission of sins;

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.4">As it was written in the book of the sayings of Isaias the prophet:  A
voice of one crying in the wilderness:  Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
straight his paths.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.5">Every valley shall be filled; and every mountain and hill shall be brought
low; and the crooked shall be made straight; and the rough ways plain;

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.6">And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.7">He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized by him:
Ye offspring of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.8">Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance; and do not begin to say,
We have Abraham for our father.  For I say unto you, that God is able of these
stones to raise up children to Abraham.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.9">For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees.  Every tree therefore
that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down and cast into the fire.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.10">And the people asked him, saying:  What then shall we do?

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.11">And he answering, said to them:  He that hath two coats, let him give to
him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do in like manner.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.12">And the publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him:  Master, what
shall we do?

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.13">But he said to them:  Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.14">And the soldiers also asked him, saying:  And what shall we do?  And he
said to them:  Do violence to no man; neither calumniate any man; and be
content with your pay.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.15">And as the people were of opinion, and all were thinking in their hearts
of John, that perhaps he might be the Christ;

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.16">John answered, saying unto all:  I indeed baptize you with water; but
there shall come one mightier that I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to loose:  he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.17">Whose fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor, and will gather the
wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.18">And many other things exhorting, did he preach to the people.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.19">But Herod the tetrarch, when he was reproved by him for Herodias, his
brother's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done;

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.20">He added this also above all, and shut up John in prison.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.21">Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also
being baptized and praying, heaven was opened;

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.22">And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove upon him; and a
voice came from heaven:  Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

</p>
               <p n="N3.3.23">And Jesus himself was beginning about the age of thirty years; being (as

               <p n="N3.4.1">And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from the Jordan, and was
led by the Spirit into the desert,

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.2">For the space of forty days; and was tempted by the devil.  And he ate
nothing in those days; and when they were ended, he was hungry.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.3">And the devil said to him:  If thou be the Son of God, say to this stone
that it be made bread.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.4">And Jesus answered him:  It is written, that Man liveth not by bread
alone, but by every word of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.5">And the devil led him into a high mountain, and shewed him all the
kingdoms of the world in a moment of time;

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.6">And he said to him:  To thee will I give all this power, and the glory of
them; for to me they are delivered, and to whom I will, I give them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.7">If thou therefore wilt adore before me, all shall be thine.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.8">And Jesus answering said to him:  It is written:  Thou shalt adore the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.9">And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple,
and he said to him:  If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself from hence.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.10">For it is written, that He hath given his angels charge over thee, that
they keep thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.11">And that in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash
thy foot against a stone.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.12">And Jesus answering, said to him:  It is said:  Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.13">And all the temptation being ended, the devil departed from him for a
time.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.14">And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit, into Galilee, and the fame
of him went out through the whole country.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.15">And he taught in their synagogues, and was magnified by all.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.16">And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up:  and he went into the
synagogue, according to his custom, on the sabbath day; and he rose up to read.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.17">And the book of Isaias the prophet was delivered unto him.  And as he
unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written:

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.18">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me.  Wherefore he hath anointed me to
preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the contrite of heart,

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.19">To preach deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind, to set at
liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and
the day of reward.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.20">And when he had folded the book, he restored it to the minister, and sat
down.  And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.21">And he began to say to them:  This day is fulfilled this scripture in
your ears.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.22">And all gave testimony to him:  and they wondered at the words of grace
that proceeded from his mouth, and they said:  Is not this the son of Joseph?

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.23">And he said to them:  Doubtless you will say to me this similitude:
Physician, heal thyself:  as great things as we have heard done in Capharnaum,
do also here in thy own country.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.24">And he said:  Amen I say to you, that no prophet is accepted in his own
country.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.25">In truth I say to you, there were many widows in the days of Elias in
Israel, when heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a
great famine throughout all the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.26">And to none of them was Elias sent, but to Sarepta of Sidon, to a widow
woman.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.27">And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet:
and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.28">And all they in the synagogue, hearing these things, were filled with
anger.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.29">And they rose up and thrust him out of the city; and they brought him to
the brow of the hill, whereon their city was built, that they might cast him
down headlong.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.30">But he passing through the midst of them, went his way.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.31">And he went down into Capharnaum, a city of Galilee, and there he taught
them on the sabbath days.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.32">And they were astonished at his doctrine:  for his speech was with power.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.33">And in the synagogue there was a man who had an unclean devil, and he
cried out with a loud voice,

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.34">Saying:  Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth?
art thou come to destroy us?  I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.35">And Jesus rebuked him, saying:  Hold thy peace, and go out of him.  And
when the devil had thrown him into the midst, he went out of him, and hurt him
not at all.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.36">And there came fear upon all, and they talked among themselves, saying:
What word is this, for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean
spirits, and they go out?

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.37">And the fame of him was published into every place of the country.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.38">And Jesus rising up out of the synagogue, went into Simon's house.  And
Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever, and they besought him for
her.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.39">And standing over her, he commanded the fever, and it left her.  And
immediately rising, she ministered to them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.40">And when the sun was down, all they that had any sick with divers
diseases, brought them to him.  But he laying his hands on every one of them,
healed them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.41">And devils went out from many, crying out and saying:  Thou art the Son of
God.  And rebuking them he suffered them not to speak, for they knew that he
was Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.42">And when it was day, going out he went into a desert place, and the
multitudes sought him, and came unto him:  and they stayed him that he should
not depart from them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.43">To whom he said:  To other cities also I must preach the kingdom of God:
for therefore am I sent.

</p>
               <p n="N3.4.44">And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

               <head>Chapter 5</head>
               <p n="N3.5.1">And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the
word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth,

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.2">And saw two ships standing by the lake:  but the fishermen were gone out
of them, and were washing their nets.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.3">And going into one of the ships that was Simon's, he desired him to draw
back a little from the land.  And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the
ship.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.4">Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon:  Launch out into the
deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.5">And Simon answering said to him:  Master, we have labored all the night,
and have taken nothing:  but at thy word I will let down the net.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.6">And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of
fishes, and their net broke.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.7">And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they
should come and help them.  And they came, and filled both the ships, so that
they were almost sinking.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.8">Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying:  Depart
from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.9">For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
of the fishes which they had taken.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.10">And so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's
partners.  And Jesus saith to Simon:  Fear not:  from henceforth thou shalt
catch men.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.11">And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed
him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.12">And it came to pass, when he was ina certain city, behold a man full of
leprosy, who seeing Jesus, and falling on his face, besought him, saying:
Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.13">And stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying:  I will.  Be thou
cleansed.  And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.14">And he charged him that he should tell no man, but, Go, shew thyself to
the priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a
testimony to them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.15">But the fame of him went abroad the more, and great multitudes came
together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.16">And he retired into the desert, and prayed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.17">And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were
also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were come out of every
town of Galilee, and Judea and Jerusalem:  and the power of the Lord was to
heal them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.18">And behold, men brought in a bed a man, who had the palsy:  and they
sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.19">And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because
of the multitude, they went up upon the roof, and let him down through the
tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.20">Whose faith when he saw, he said:  Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.21">And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying:  Who is this who
speaketh blasphemies?  Who can forgive sins, but God alone?

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.22">And when Jesus knew their thoughts, answering, he said to them:  What is
it you think in your hearts?

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.23">Which is easier to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and
walk?

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.24">But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive
sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say to thee, Arise, take up thy
bed, and go into thy house.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.25">And immediately rising up before them, he took up the bed on which he lay;
and he went away to his own house, glorifying God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.26">And all were astonished; and they glorified God.  And they were filled
with fear, saying:  We have seen wonderful things to day.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.27">And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican named Levi,
sitting at the receipt of custom, and he said to him:  Follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.28">And leaving all things, he rose up and followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.29">And Levi made him a great feast in his own house; and there was a great
company of publicans, and of others, that were at table with them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.30">But the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying to his disciples:  Why do
you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.31">And Jesus answering, said to them:  They that are whole, need not the
physician:  but they that are sick.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.32">I came not to call the just, but sinners to penance.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.33">And they said to him:  Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make
prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner; but thine eat and
drink?

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.34">To whom he said:  Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast, whilst
the bridegroom is with them?

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.35">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them,
then shall they fast in those days.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.36">And he spoke also a similitude to them:  That no man putteth a piece from
a new garment upon an old garment; otherwise he both rendeth the new, and the
piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.37">And no man putteth new wine into old bottle:  otherwise the new wine will
break the bottles, and it will be spilled, and the bottles will be lost.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.38">But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.

</p>
               <p n="N3.5.39">And no man drinking old, hath presently a mind to new:  for he saith, The
old is better.

               <p n="N3.6.1">And it came to pass on the second first sabbath, that as he went through
the corn fields, his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in
their hands.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.2">And some of the Pharisees said to them:  Why do you that which is not
lawful on the sabbath days?

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.3">And Jesus answering them, said:  Have you not read so much as this, what
David did, when himself was hungry, and they that were with him:

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.4">How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the bread of
proposition, and gave to them that were with him, which is not lawful to eat
but only for the priests?

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.5">And he said to them:  The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.6">And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the
synagogue, and taught.  And there was a man, whose right hand was withered.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.7">And the scribes and Pharisees watched if he would heal on the sabbath;
that they might find an accusation against him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.8">But he knew their thoughts; and said to the man who had the withered
hand:  Arise, and stand forth in the midst.  And rising he stood forth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.9">Then Jesus said to them:  I ask you, if it be lawful on the sabbath days
to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to destroy?

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.10">And looking round about on them all, he said to the man:  Stretch forth
thy hand.  And he stretched it forth:  and his hand was restored.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.11">And they were filled with madness; and they talked one with another, what
they might do to Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.12">And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to
pray, and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.13">And when day was come, he called unto him his disciples; and he chose
twelve of them (whom also he named apostles):

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.14">Simon, whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John,
Philip and Bartholomew,

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.15">Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who is called
Zelotes,

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.16">And Jude, the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.17">And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place, and the company of
his disciples, and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and
Jerusalem, and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon,

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.18">Who were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases.  And they
that were troubled with unclean spirits, were cured.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.19">And all the multitude sought to touch him, for virtue went out from him,
and healed all.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.20">And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said:  Blessed are ye poor,
for yours is the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.21">Blessed are ye that hunger now:  for you shall be filled.  Blessed are ye
that weep now:  for you shall laugh.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.22">Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate
you, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of
man's sake.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.23">Be glad in that day and rejoice; for behold, your reward is great in
heaven.  For according to these things did their fathers to the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.24">But woe to you that are rich:  for you have your consolation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.25">Woe to you that are filled:  for you shall hunger.  Woe to you that now
laugh:  for you shall mourn and weep.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.26">Woe to you when men shall bless you:  for according to these things did
their fathers to the false prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.27">But I say to you that hear:  Love your enemies, do good to them that hate
you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.28">Bless them that curse you, and pray for them that calumniate you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.29">And to him that striketh thee on the one cheek, offer also the other.  And
him that taketh away from thee thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.30">Give to every one that asketh thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods,
ask them not again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.31">And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them in like
manner.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.32">And if you love them that love you, what thanks are to you?  for sinners
also love those that love them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.33">And if you do good to them who do good to you, what thanks are to you?
for sinners also do this.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.34">And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thanks are to
you?  for sinners also lend to sinners, for to receive as much.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.35">But love ye your enemies:  do good, and lend, hoping for nothing
thereby:  and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the
Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.36">Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.37">Judge not, and you shall not be judged.  Condemn not, and you shall not be
condemned.  Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.38">Give, and it shall be given to you:  good measure and pressed down and
shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom.  For with the
same measure that you shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.39">And he spoke also to them a similitude:  Can the blind lead the blind?  do
they not both fall into the ditch?

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.40">The disciple is not above his master:  but every one shall be perfect, if
he be as his master.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.41">And why seest thou the mote in thy brother's eye:  but the beam that is in
thy own eye thou considerest not?

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.42">Or how canst thou say to thy brother:  Brother, let me pull the mote out
of thy eye, when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own eye?  Hypocrite,
cast first the beam out of thy own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to take
out the mote from thy brother's eye.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.43">For there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit; nor an evil tree
that bringeth forth good fruit.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.44">For every tree is known by its fruit.  For men do not gather figs from
thorns; nor from a bramble bush do they gather the grape.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.45">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which
is good:  and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which
is evil.  For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.46">And why call you me, Lord, Lord; and do not the things which I say?

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.47">Every one that cometh to me, and heareth my words, and doth them, I will
shew you to whom he is like.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.48">He is like to a man building a house, who digged deep, and laid the
foundation upon a rock.  And when a flood came, the stream beat vehemently
upon that house, and it could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.

</p>
               <p n="N3.6.49">But he that heareth, and doth not, is like to a man building his house
upon the earth without a foundation:  against which the stream beat vehemently,
and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.

               <p n="N3.7.1">And when he had finished all his words in the hearing of the people, he
entered into Capharnaum.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.2">And the servant of a certain centurion, who was dear to him, being sick,
was ready to die.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.3">And when he had heard of  Jesus,  he sent unto him the ancients of the
Jews, desiring him to come and heal his servant.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.4">And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying to him:
He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.5">For he loveth our nation; and he hath built us a synagogue.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.6">And Jesus went with them.  And when he was now not far from the house, the
centurion sent his friends to him, saying:  Lord, trouble not thyself; for I
am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.7">For which cause neither did I think myself  worthy to come to thee; but
say the word, and my servant shall be healed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.8">For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers:  and
I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my
servant, Do this, and he doth it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.9">Which Jesus hearing, marvelled:  and turning about to the multitude that
followed him, he said:  Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith,
not even in Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.10">And they who were sent, being returned to the house, found the servant
whole who had been sick.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.11">And it came to pass afterwards, that he went into a city that is called
Naim; and there went with him his disciples, and a great multitude.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.12">And when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead man was
carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow:  and a great
multitude of the city was with her.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.13">Whom when the Lord had seen, being moved with mercy towards her, he
said to her:  Weep not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.14">And he came near and touched the bier.  And they that carried it, stood
still.  And he said:  Young man, I say to thee, arise.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.15">And he that was dead, sat up, and began to speak.  And he gave him to
his mother.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.16">And there came a fear on them all:  and they glorified God, saying:  A
great prophet is risen up among us:  and, God hath visited his people.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.17">And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all
the country round about.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.18">And John's disciples told him of all these things.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.19">And John called to him two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus,
saying:  Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another?

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.20">And when the men were come unto him, they said:  John the Baptist hath
sent us to thee, saying:  Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another?

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.21">(And in that same hour, he cured many of their diseases, and hurts, and
evil spirits:  and to many that were blind he gave sight.)

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.22">And answering, he said to them:  Go and relate to John what you have heard
and seen:  the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf
hear, the dead rise again, to the poor the gospel is preached:

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.23">And blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.24">And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the
multitudes concerning John.  What went ye out into the desert to see?  a reed
shaken with the wind?

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.25">But what went you out to see?  a man clothed in soft garments?  Behold
they that are in costly apparel and live delicately, are in the houses of
kings.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.26">But what went you out to see?  a prophet?  Yea, I say to you, and more
than a prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.27">This is he of whom it is written:  Behold I send my angel before thy face,
who shall prepare thy way before thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.28">For I say to you:  Amongst those that are born of women, there is not a
greater prophet that John the Baptist.  But he that is the lesser in the
kingdom of God, is greater than he.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.29">And all the people hearing, and the publicans, justified God, being
baptized with John's baptism.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.30">But the Pharisees and the lawyers despised the counsel of God against
themselves, being not baptized by him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.31">And the Lord said:  Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation?  and to what are they like?

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.32">They are like to children sitting in the marketplace, and speaking one to
another, and saying:  We have piped to you, and you have not danced:  we have
mourned, and you have not wept.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you
say:  He hath a devil.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.34">The Son of man is come eating and drinking:  and you say:  Behold a man
that is a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.35">And wisdom is justified by all her children.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.36">And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him.  And he went into
the house of the Pharisee, and sat down to meat.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.37">And behold a woman that was in the city, a sinner, when she knew that he
sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment;

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.38">And standing behind at his feet, she began to wash his feet, with tears,
and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed
them with the ointment.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.39">And the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing it, spoke within himself,
saying:  This man, if he were a prophet, would know surely who and what manner
of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.40">And Jesus answering, said to him:  Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee.
But he said:  Master, say it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.41">A certain creditor had two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence,
and the other fifty.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.42">And whereas they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both.  Which
therefore of the two loveth him most?

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.43">Simon answering, said:  I suppose that he to whom he forgave most.  And he
said to him:  Thou hast judged rightly.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.44">And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon:  Dost thou see this woman?
I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she with
tears hath washed my feet, and with her hairs hath wiped them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.45">Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, since she came in, hath not ceased to
kiss my feet.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.46">My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she with ointment hath
anointed my feet.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.47">Wherefore I say to thee:  Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath
loved much.  But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.48">And he said to her:  Thy sins are forgiven thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.49">And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves:  Who is
this that forgiveth sins also?

</p>
               <p n="N3.7.50">And he said to the woman:  Thy faith hath made thee safe, go in peace.

               <head>Chapter 8</head>
               <p n="N3.8.1">And it came to pass afterwards, that he travelled through the cities and
towns, preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God; and the twelve with him:

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.2">And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities;
Mary who is called Magdalen, out of whom seven devils were gone forth,

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.3">And Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many
others who ministered unto him of their substance.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.4">And when a very great multitude was gathered together, and hastened out of
the cities unto him, he spoke by a similitude.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.5">The sower went out to sow his seed.  And as he sowed, some fell by the
way side, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.6">And other some fell upon a rock:  and as soon as it was sprung up, it
withered away, because it had no moisture.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.7">And other some fell among thorns, and the thorns growing up with it,
choked it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.8">And other some fell upon good ground; and being sprung up, yielded fruit a
hundredfold.  Saying these things, he cried out:  He that hath ears to hear,
let him hear.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.9">And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.10">To whom he said:  To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom
of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing
may not understand.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.11">Now the parable is this:  The seed is the word of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.12">And they by the way side are they that hear; then the devil cometh, and
taketh the word out of their heart, lest believing they should be saved.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.13">Now they upon the rock, are they who when they hear, receive the word with
joy:  and these have no roots; for they believe for a while, and in time of
temptation, they fall away.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.14">And that which fell among thorns, are they who have heard, and going their
way, are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and yield
no fruit.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.15">But that on the good ground, are they who in a good and perfect heart,
hearing the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in patience.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.16">Now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it
under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that they who come in may see
the light.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.17">For there is not any thing secret that shall not be made manifest, nor
hidden, that shall not be known and come abroad.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.18">Take heed therefore how you hear.  For whosoever hath, to him shall be
given:  and whosoever hath not, that also which he thinketh he hath, shall be
taken away from him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.19">And his mother and brethren came unto him; and they could not come at him
for the crowd.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.20">And it was told him:  Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring
to see thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.21">Who answering, said to them:  My mother and my brethren are they who hear
the word of God, and do it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.22">And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little ship with
his disciples, and he said to them:  Let us go over to the other side of the
lake.  And they launched forth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.23">And when they were sailing, he slept; and there came down a storm of wind
upon the lake, and they were filled, and were in danger.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.24">And they came and awaked him, saying:  Master, we perish.  But he arising,
rebuked the wind and the rage of the water; and it ceased, and there was a
calm.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.25">And he said to them:  Where is your faith?  Who being afraid, wondered,
saying one to another:  Who is this, (think you), that he commandeth both the
winds and the sea, and they obey him?

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.26">And they sailed to the country of the Gerasens, which is over against
Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.27">And when he was come forth to the land, there met him a certain man who
had a devil now a very long time, and he wore no clothes, neither did he abide
in a house, but in the sepulchres.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.28">And when he saw Jesus, he fell down before him; and crying out with a loud
voice, he said:  What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God?
I beseech thee, do not torment me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.29">For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man.  For many times
it seized him, and he was bound with chains, and kept in fetters; and breaking
the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the deserts.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.30">And Jesus asked him, saying:  What is thy name?  But he said:  Legion;
because many devils were entered into him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.31">And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.32">And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they
besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them.  And he suffered
them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.33">The devils therefore went out of the man, and entered into the swine; and
the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were stifled.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.34">Which when they that fed them saw done, they fled away, and told it in the
city and in the villages.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.35">And they went out to see what was done; and they came to Jesus, and found
the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at his feet, clothed,
and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.36">And they also that had seen, told them how he had been healed from the
legion.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.37">And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to
depart from them; for they were taken with great fear.  And he, going up into
the ship, returned back again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.38">Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he
might be with him.  But Jesus sent him away, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.39">Return to thy house, and tell how great things God hath done to thee.
And he went through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done
to him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.40">And it came to pass, that when Jesus was returned, the multitude received
him:  for they were all waiting for him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.41">And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of
the synagogue:  and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, beseeching him that he
would come into his house:

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.42">For he had an only daughter, almost twelve years old, and she was dying.
And it happened as he went, that he was thronged by the multitudes.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.43">And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who
had bestowed all her substance on physicians, and could not be healed by any.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.44">She came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and immediately
the issue of her blood stopped.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.45">And Jesus said:  Who is it that touched me?  And all denying, Peter and
they that were with him said:  Master, the multitudes throng and press thee,
and dost thou say, Who touched me?

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.46">And Jesus said:  Somebody hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone
out from me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.47">And the woman seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and fell down
before his feet, and declared before all the people for what cause she had
touched him, and how she was immediately healed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.48">But he said to her:  Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go thy way
in peace.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.49">As he was yet speaking, there cometh one to the ruler of the synagogue,
saying to him:  Thy daughter is dead, trouble him not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.50">And Jesus hearing this word, answered the father of the maid:  Fear not;
believe only, and she shall be safe.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.51">And when he was come to the house, he suffered not any man to go in with
him, but Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.52">And all wept and mourned for her.  But he said:  Weep not; the maid is not
dead, but sleepeth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.53">And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.54">But he taking her by the hand, cried out, saying:  Maid, arise.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.55">And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately.  And he bid them give
her to eat.

</p>
               <p n="N3.8.56">And her parents were astonished, whom he charged to tell no man what was
done.

               <p n="N3.9.1">Then calling together the twelve apostles, he gave them power and
authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.2">And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.3">And he said to them:  Take nothing for your journey; neither staff, nor
scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.4">And whatsoever house you shall enter into, abide there, and depart not
from thence.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.5">And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off
even the dust of your feet, for a testimony against them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.6">And going out, they went about through the towns, preaching the gospel,
and healing every where.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.7">Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard of all things that were done by him; and he
was in a doubt, because it was said

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.8">By some, that John was risen from the dead:  but by other some, that Elias
had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.9">And Herod said:  John I have beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear
such things?  And he sought to see him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.10">And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all they had done.
And taking them, he went aside into a desert place, apart, which belongeth to
Bethsaida.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.11">Which when the people knew, they followed him; and he received them, and
spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed them who had need of healing.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.12">Now the day began to decline.  And the twelve came and said to him:  Send
away the multitude, that going into the towns and villages round about, they
may lodge and get victuals; for we are here in a desert place.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.13">But he said to them:  Give you them to eat.  And they said:  We have no
more than five loaves and two fishes; unless perhaps we should go and buy food
for all this multitude.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.14">Now there were about five thousand men.  And he said to his disciples:
Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.15">And they did so; and made them all sit down.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.16">And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven,
and blessed them; and he broke, and distributed to his disciples, to set before
the multitude.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.17">And they did all eat, and were filled.  And there were taken up of
fragments that remained to them, twelve baskets.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.18">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples also were with
him:  and he asked them, saying:  Whom do the people say that I am?

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.19">But they answered, and said:  John the Baptist; but some say Elias; and
others say that one of the former prophets is risen again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.20">And he said to them:  But whom do you say that I am?  Simon Peter
answering, said:  The Christ of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.21">But he strictly charging them, commanded they should tell this to no man.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.22">Saying:  The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the
ancients and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day rise
again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.23">And he said to all:  If any man will come after me, let him deny himself,
and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.24">For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; for he that shall lose
his life for my sake, shall save it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.25">For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose
himself, and cast away himself?

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.26">For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of man
shall be ashamed, when he shall come in his majesty, and that of his Father,
and of the holy angels.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.27">But I tell you of a truth:  There are some standing here that shall not
taste death, till they see the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.28">And it came to pass about eight days after these words, that he took
Peter, and James, and John, and went up into a mountain to pray.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.29">And whilst he prayed, the shape of his countenance was altered, and his
raiment became white and glittering.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.30">And behold two men were talking with him.  And they were Moses and Elias,

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.31">Appearing in majesty.  And they spoke of his decease that he should
accomplish in Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.32">But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.  And waking,
they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.33">And it came to pass, that as they were departing from him, Peter saith to
Jesus:  Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three
tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; not knowing
what he said.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.34">And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them;
and they were afraid, when they entered into the cloud.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.35">And a voice came out of the cloud, saying:  This is my beloved Son; hear
him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.36">And whilst the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone.  And they held
their peace, and told no man in those days any of these things which they had
seen.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.37">And it came to pass the day following, when they came down from the
mountain, there met him a great multitude.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.38">And behold a man among the crowd cried out, saying:  Master, I beseech
thee, look upon my son, because he is my only one.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.39">And lo, a spirit seizeth him, and he suddenly crieth out, and he throweth
him down and teareth him, so that he foameth; and bruising him, he hardly
departeth from him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.40">And I desired thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.41">And Jesus answering, said:  O faithless and perverse generation, how long
shall I be with you, and suffer you?  Bring hither thy son.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.42">And as he was coming to him, the devil threw him down, and tore him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.43">And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the boy, and restored him
to his father.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.44">And all were astonished at the mighty power of God.  But while all
wondered at all the things he did, he said to his disciples:  Lay you up in
your hearts these words, for it shall come to pass, that the Son of man shall
be delivered into the hands of men.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.45">But they understood not this word; and it was hid from them, so that they
perceived it not.  And they were afraid to ask him concerning this word.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.46">And there entered a thought into them, which of them should be greater.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.47">But Jesus seeing the thoughts of their heart, took a child and set him by
him,

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.48">And said to them:  Whosoever shall receive this child in my name,
receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me.
For he that is the lesser among you all, he is the greater.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.49">And John, answering, said:  Master, we saw a certain man casting out
devils in thy name, and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.50">And Jesus said to him:  Forbid him not; for he that is not against you,
is for you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.51">And it came to pass, when the days of his assumption were accomplishing,
that he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.52">And he sent messengers before his face; and going, they entered into a
city of the Samaritans, to prepare for him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.53">And they received him not, because his face was of one going to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.54">And when his disciples James and John had seen this, they said:  Lord,
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.55">And turning, he rebuked them, saying:  You know not of what spirit you
are.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.56">The Son of man came not to destroy souls, but to save.  And they went into
another town.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.57">And it came to pass, as they walked in the way, that a certain man said to
him:  I will follow thee withersoever thou goest.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.58">Jesus said to him:  The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests;
but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.59">But he said to another:  Follow me.  And he said:  Lord, suffer me first
to go, and to bury my father.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.60">And Jesus said to him:  Let the dead bury their dead:  but go thou, and
preach the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.61">And another said:  I will follow thee, Lord; but let me first take my
leave of them that are at my house.

</p>
               <p n="N3.9.62">Jesus said to him:  No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking
back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

               <p n="N3.10.27">He answering, said:  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole
heart, and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
mind:  and thy neighbour as thyself.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.28">And he said to him:  Thou hast answered right:  this do, and thou shalt
live.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.29">But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus:  And who is my
neighbour?

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.30">And Jesus answering, said:  A certain man went down from Jerusalem to
Jericho, and fell among robbers, who also stripped him, and having wounded him
went away, leaving him half dead.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.31">And it chanced, that a certain priest went down the same way:  and seeing
him, passed by.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.32">In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place and saw him,
passed by.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.33">But a certain Samaritan being on his journey, came near him; and seeing
him, was moved with compassion.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.34">And going up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine:  and
setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.35">And the next day he took out two pence, and gave to the host, and said:
Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my
return, will repay thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.36">Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell among
the robbers?

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.37">But he said:  He that shewed mercy to him.  And Jesus said to him:  Go,
and do thou in like manner.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.38">Now it came to pass as they went, that he entered into a certain town:
and a certain woman named Martha, received him into her house.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.39">And she had a sister called Mary, who sitting also at the Lord's feet,
heard his word.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.40">But Martha was busy about much serving.  Who stood and said: Lord, hast
thou no care that my sister hath left me alone to serve?  speak to her
therefore, that she help me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.41">And the Lord answering, said to her:  Martha, Martha, thou art careful,
and art troubled about many things:

</p>
               <p n="N3.10.42">But one thing is necessary.  Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall
not be taken away from her.

               <p n="N3.11.1">And it came to pass, that as he was in a certain place praying, when he
ceased, one of his disciples said to him:  Lord, teach us to pray, as John also
taught his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.2">And he said to them:  When you pray, say:  Father, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.3">Give us this day our daily bread.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.4">And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to
us.  And lead us not into temptation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.5">And he said to them:  Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to
him at midnight, and shall say to him:  Friend, lend me three loaves,

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.6">Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me, and I have not
what to set before him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.7">And he from within should answer, and say:  Trouble me not, the door is
now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.8">Yet if he shall continue knocking, I say to you, although he will not
rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet, because of his importunity,
he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.9">And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you:  seek, and you shall
find:  knock, and it shall be opened to you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.10">For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to
him that knocketh, it shall be opened.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.11">And which of you, if he ask his father bread, will he give him a stone?
or a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.12">Or if he shall ask an egg, will he reach him a scorpion?

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.13">If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that
ask him?

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.14">And he was casting out a devil, and the same was dumb:  and when he had
cast out the devil, the dumb spoke:  and the multitudes were in admiration at
it:

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.15">But some of them said:  He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of
devils.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.16">And others tempting, asked of him a sign from heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.17">But he seeing their thoughts, said to them:  Every kingdom divided against
itself, shall be brought to desolation, and house upon house shall fall.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.18">And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
stand?  because you say, that through Beelzebub I cast out devils.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.19">Now if I cast out devils by Beelzebub; by whom do your children cast them
out?  Therefore they shall be your judges.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.20">But if I by the finger of God cast out devils; doubtless the kingdom of
God is come upon you.

which he possesseth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.22">But if a stronger than he come upon him, and overcome him; he will take
away all his armour wherein he trusted, and will distribute his spoils.

without water, seeking rest; and not finding, he saith:  I will return into my
house whence I came out.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.25">And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.26">Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than
himself, and entering in they dwell there.  And the last state of that man
becomes worse than the first.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.27">And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman from the
crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him:  Blessed is the womb that bore thee,
and the paps that gave thee suck.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.28">But he said:  Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God, and
keep it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.29">And the multitudes running together, he began to say:  This generation is
a wicked generation:  it asketh a sign, and a sign shall not be given it, but
the sign of Jonas the prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.30">For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninivites; so shall the Son of man also be
to this generation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.31">The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men of this
generation, and shall condemn them:  because she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold more than Solomon here.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.32">The men of Ninive shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and
shall condemn it; because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas; and
behold more than Jonas here.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.33">No man lighteth a candle, and putteth it in a hidden place, nore under a
bushel; but upon a candlestick, that they that come in, may see the light.

</p>

will be lightsome:  but if it be evil, thy body also will be darksome.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.35">Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darkness.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.36">If then thy whole body be lightsome, having no part of darkness; the whole
shall be lightsome; and as a bright lamp, shall enlighten thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.37">And as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee prayed him, that he would dine
with him.  And he going in, sat down to eat.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.38">And the Pharisee began to say, thinking within himself, why he was not
washed before dinner.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.39">And the Lord said to him:  Now you Pharisees make clean the outside of the
cup and of the platter; but your inside is full of rapine and iniquity.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.40">Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without, make also that which
is within?

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.41">But yet that which remaineth, give alms; and behold, all things are clean
unto you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.42">But woe to you, Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every herb;
and pass over judgment, and the charity of God.  Now these things you ought
to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.43">Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues, and salutations in the marketplace.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.44">Woe to you, because you are as sepulchres that appear not, and men that
walk over are not aware.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.45">And one of the lawyers answering, saith to him:  Master, in saying these
things, thou reproachest us also.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.46">But he said:  Woe to you lawyers also, because you load men with burdens
which they cannot bear, and you yourselves touch not the packs with one of your
fingers.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.47">Woe to you who build the monuments of the prophets:  and your fathers
killed them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.48">Truly you bear witness that you consent to the doings of your fathers:
for they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchres.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.49">For this cause also the wisdom of God said:  I will send to them prophets
and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.50">That the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of
the world, may be required of this generation,

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.51">From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, who was slain between
the alter and the temple:  Yea I say to you, It shall be required of this
generation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.52">Woe to you lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge:  you
yourselves have not entered in, and those that were entering in, you have
hindered.

</p>
               <p n="N3.11.53">And as he was saying these things to them, the Pharisees and the lawyers
began violently to urge him, and to oppress his mouth about many things,

               <p n="N3.11.54">Lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch something from his mouth,
that they might accuse him.

another, he began to say to his disciples:  Beware ye of the leaven of the
Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

               <p n="N3.12.53">The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against his
father, the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother,
the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against
her mother in law.

</p>
               <p n="N3.12.54">And he said also to the multitudes:  When you see a cloud rising from the
west, presently you say:  A shower is coming:  and so it happeneth:

</p>
               <p n="N3.12.55">And when ye see the south wind blow, you say:  There will be heat:  and it
cometh to pass.

</p>
               <p n="N3.12.56">You hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the heaven and of the
earth:  but how is it that you do not discern this time?

</p>
               <p n="N3.12.57">And why even of yourselves, do you not judge that which is just?

</p>
               <p n="N3.12.58">And when thou goest with thy adversary to the prince, whilst thou art in
the way, endeavour to be delivered from him:  lest perhaps he draw thee to the
judge, and the judge deliver thee to the exacter, and the exacter cast thee
into prison.

</p>
               <p n="N3.12.59">I say to thee, thou shalt not go out thence, until thou pay the very last
mite.

               <p n="N3.13.1">And there were present, at that very time, some that told him of the
Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.2">And he answering, said to them:  Think you that these Galileans were
sinners above all the men of Galilee, because they suffered such things?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.3">No, I say to you:  but unless you shall do penance, you shall all likewise
perish.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.4">Or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in Siloe, and slew them:  think
you, that they also were debtors above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.5">No, I say to you; but except you do penance, you shall all likewise perish.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.6">He spoke also this parable:  A certain man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.7">And he said to the dresser of the vineyard:  Behold, for these three years
I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none.  Cut it done
therefore:  why cumbereth it the ground?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.8">But he answering, said to him:  Lord, let it alone this year also, until I
dig about it, and dung it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.9">And if happily it bear fruit:  but if not, then after that thou shalt cut
it down.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.10">And he was teaching in their synagogue on their sabbath.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.11">And behold there was a woman, who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen
years:  and she was bowed together, neither could she look upwards at all.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.12">Whom when Jesus saw, he called her unto him, and said to her:  Woman,
thou art delivered from thy infirmity.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.13">And he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made straight, and
glorified God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.14">And the ruler of the synagogue (being angry that Jesus had healed on the
sabbath) answering, said to the multitude:  Six days there are wherein you
ought to work.  In them therefore come, and be healed; and not on the sabbath
day.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.15">And the Lord answering him, said:  Ye hypocrites, doth not every one of
you, on the sabbath day, loose his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead them
to water?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.16">And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these
eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.17">And when he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed:  and all
the people rejoiced for all the things that were gloriously done by him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.18">He said therefore:  To what is the kingdom of God like, and whereunto
shall I resemble it?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.19">It is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his
garden, and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged
in the branches thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.20">And again he said:  Whereunto shall I esteem the kingdom of God to be
like?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.21">It is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.22">And he went through the cities and towns teaching, and making his journey
to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.23">And a certain man said to him:  Lord, are they few that are saved?  But
he said to them:

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.24">Strive to enter by the narrow gate; for many, I say to you, shall seek to
enter, and shall not be able.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.25">But when the master of the house shall be gone in, and shall shut the
door, you shall begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying:  Lord,
open to us.  And he answering, shall say to you:  I know you not, whence you
are.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.26">Then you shall begin to say:  We have eaten and drunk in thy presence,
and thou hast taught in our streets.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.27">And he shall say to you:  I know you not, whence you are:  depart from me,
all ye workers of iniquity.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.28">There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you
yourselves thrust out.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.29">And there shall come from the east and the west, and the north and the

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.30">And behold, they are last that shall be first; and they are first that
shall be last.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.31">The same day, there came some of the Pharisees, saying to him:  Depart,
and get thee hence, for Herod hath a mind to kill thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.32">And he said to them:  Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and
do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I am consummated.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.33">Nevertheless I must walk to day and to morrow, and the day following,
because it cannot be that a prophet perish, out of Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.34">Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are
sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children as the bird doth
her brood under her wings, and thou wouldest not?

</p>
               <p n="N3.13.35">Behold your house shall be left to you desolate.  And I say to you, that
you shall not see me till the time come, when you shall say:  Blessed is he
that cometh in the name of the Lord.

               <head>Chapter 14</head>
               <p n="N3.14.1">And it came to pass, when Jesus went into the house of one of the chief
of the Pharisees, on the sabbath day, to eat bread, that they watched him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.2">And behold, there was a certain man before him that had the dropsy.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.3">And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying:  Is it
lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.4">But they held their peace.  But he taking him, healed him, and sent him
away.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.5">And answering them, he said:  Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall
into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out, on the sabbath day?

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.6">And they could not answer him to these things.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.7">And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited, marking how they
chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.8">When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first place, lest
perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him:

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.9">And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee, Give this man
place:  and then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.10">But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place; that when he
who invited thee, cometh, he may say to thee:  Friend, go up higher.  Then
shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.11">Because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled; and he that
humbleth himself, shall be exalted.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.12">And he said to him also that had invited him:  When thou makest a dinner
or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy
neighbours who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite thee again, and a
recompense be made to thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.13">But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and
the blind;

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.14">And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make thee
recompense:  for recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.15">When one of them that sat at table with him, had heard these things, he
said to him:  Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.16">But he said to him:  A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.17">And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were
invited, that they should come, for now all things are ready.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.18">And they began all at once to make excuse.  The first said to him:  I have
bought a farm, and I must needs go out and see it:  I pray thee, hold me
excused.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.19">And another said:  I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them:
I pray thee, hold me excused.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.20">And another said:  I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.21">And the servant returning, told these things to his lord.  Then the master
of the house, being angry, said to his servant:  Go out quickly into the
streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the feeble,
and the blind, and the lame.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.22">And the servant said:  Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet
there is room.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.23">And the Lord said to the servant:  Go out into the highways and hedges,
and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.24">But I say unto you, that none of those men that were invited, shall taste
of my supper.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.25">And there went great multitudes with him.  And turning, he said to them:

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.26">If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my
disciple.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.27">And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me, cannot be my
disciple.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.28">For which of you having a mind to build a tower, doth not first sit down,
and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he have wherewithal to
finish it:

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.29">Lest, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able ti finish it, all
that see it begin to mock him,

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.30">Saying:  This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.31">Or what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first
sit down, and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that,
with twenty thousand, cometh against him?

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.32">Or else, whilst the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth
conditions of peace.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.33">So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he
possesseth, cannot be my disciple.

</p>
               <p n="N3.14.34">Salt is good.  But if the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it
be seasoned?

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.2">And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying:  This man receiveth
sinners, and eateth with them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.3">And he spoke to them this parable, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.4">What man of you that hath an hundred sheep:  and if he shall lose one of
them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which
was lost, until he find it?

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.5">And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.6">And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to
them:  Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.7">I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner
that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.8">Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a
candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.9">And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours,
saying:  Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.10">So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one
sinner doing penance.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.11">And he said:  A certain man had two sons:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.12">And the younger of them said to his father:  Father, give me the portion
of substance that falleth to me.  And he divided unto them his substance.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.13">And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went
abroad into a far country:  and there wasted his substance, living riotously.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.14">And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country;
and he began to be in want.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.15">And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country.  And he
sent him into his farm to feed swine.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.16">And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat;
and no man gave unto him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.17">And returning to himself, he said:  How many hired servants in my father's
house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.18">I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him:  Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and before thee:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.19">I am not worthy to be called thy son:  make me as one of thy hired
servants.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.20">And rising up he came to his father.  And when he was yet a great way off,
his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell
upon his neck, and kissed him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.21">And the son said to him:  Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before
thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.22">And the father said to his servants:  Bring forth quickly the first robe,
and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.23">And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make
merry:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.24">Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again:  was lost, and is
found.  And they began to be merry.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.25">Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the
house, he heard music and dancing:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.26">And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.27">And he said to him:  Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the
fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.28">And he was angry, and would not go in.  His father therefore coming out
began to entreat him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.29">And he answering, said to his father:  Behold, for so many years do I
serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast
never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.30">But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with
harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.31">But he said to him:  Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is
thine.

</p>
               <p n="N3.15.32">But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother
was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.

               <p n="N3.16.1">And he said also to his disciples:  There was a certain rich man who had
a steward:  and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.2">And he called him, and said to him:  How is it that I hear this of thee?
give an account of thy stewardship:  for now thou canst be steward no longer.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.3">And the steward said within himself:  What shall I do, because my lord
taketh away from me the stewardship?  To dig I am not able; to beg I am
ashamed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.4">I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship,
they may receive me into their houses.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.5">Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the
first:  How much dost thou owe my lord?

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.6">But he said:  An hundred barrels of oil.  And he said to him:  Take thy
bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.7">Then he said to another:  And how much dost thou owe?  Who said:  An
hundred quarters of wheat.  He said to him:  Take thy bill, and write eighty.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.8">And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done
wisely:  for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the
children of light.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.9">And I say to you:  Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that

you with that which is the true?

               <p n="N3.16.12">And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's; who will
give you that which is your own?

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.13">No servant can serve two masters:  for either he will hate the one, and
love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other.  You cannot
serve God and mammon.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.14">Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things:  and they
derided him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.15">And he said to them:  You are they who justify yourselves before men, but
God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination
before God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.16">The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of
God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.17">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law
to fall.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.18">Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
adultery:  and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband,
commmitteth adultery.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.19">There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen;
and feasted sumptuously every day.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.20">And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full
of sores,

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.21">Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table,
and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.22">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels
into Abraham's bosom.  And the rich man also died:  and he was buried in hell.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.23">And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off,
and Lazarus in his bosom:

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.24">And he cried, and said:  Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue:
for I am tormented in this flame.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.25">And Abraham said to him:  Son, remember that thou didst receive good
things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is
comforted; and thou art tormented.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.26">And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos:
so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come
hither.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.27">And he said:  Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to
my father's house, for I have five brethren,

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.28">That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of
torments.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.29">And Abraham said to him:  They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear
them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.30">But he said:  No, father Abraham:  but if one went to them from the dead,
they will do penance.

</p>
               <p n="N3.16.31">And he said to him:  If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.

               <p n="N3.17.1">And he said to his disciples:  It is impossible that scandals should not
come:  but woe to him through whom they come.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.2">It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and
he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.3">Take heed to yourselves.  If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him:
and if he do penance, forgive him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.4">And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a
day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.5">And the apostles said to the Lord:  Increase our faith.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.6">And the Lord said:  If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you
might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted
into the sea:  and it would obey you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.7">But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say
to him, when he is come from the field:  Immediately go, sit down to meat:

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.8">And will not rather say to him:  Make ready my supper, and gird thyself,
and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.9">Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.10">I think not.  So you also, when you shall have done all these things that
are commanded you, say:  We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which
we ought to do.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.11">And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the
midst of Samaria and Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.12">And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were
lepers, who stood afar off;

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.13">And lifted up their voice, saying:  Jesus, master, have mercy on us.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.14">Whom when he saw, he said:  Go, shew yourselves to the priests.  And it
came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.15">And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a
loud voice glorifying God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.16">And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks:  and this was a
Samaritan.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.17">And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean?  and where are the
nine?

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.18">There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.19">And he said to him:  Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee
whole.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.20">And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come?
he answered them, and said:  The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.21">Neither shall they say:  Behold here, or behold there.  For lo, the
kingdom of God is within you.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.22">And he said to his disciples:  The days will come, when you shall desire
to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.23">And they will say to you:  See here, and see there.  Go ye not after, nor
follow them:

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.24">For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the
parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.25">But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.26">And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
days of the Son of man.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.27">They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage,
until the day that Noe entered into the ark:  and the flood came and destroyed
them all.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.28">Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot:  they did eat and drink,
they bought and sold, they planted and built.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.29">And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone
from heaven, and destroyed them all.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.30">Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.31">In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the
house, let him not go down to take them away:  and he that shall be in the
field, in like manner, let him not return back.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.32">Remember Lot's wife.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.33">Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it:  and whosoever
shall lose it, shall preserve it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.34">I say to you:  in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one
shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.35">Two women shall be grinding together:  the one shall be taken, and the
other shall be left:  two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken,
and the other shall be keft.

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.36">They answering, say to him:  Where, Lord?

</p>
               <p n="N3.17.37">Who said to them:  Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles
also be gathered together.

               <head>Chapter 18</head>
               <p n="N3.18.1">And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not
to faint,

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.2">Saying:  There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor
regarded man.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.3">And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying:
Avenge me of my adversary.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.4">And he would not for a long time.  But afterwards he said within
himself:  Although I fear not God, nor regard man,

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.5">Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest
continually coming she weary me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.6">And the Lord said:  Hear what the unjust judge saith.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.7">And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night:  and will
he have patience in their regard?

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.8">I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them.  But yet the Son of man,
when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.9">And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he
spoke also this parable:

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.10">Two men went up into the temple to pray:  the one a Pharisee, and the
other a publican.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.11">The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself:  O God, I give thee
thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as
also is this publican.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.12">I fast twice in a week:  I give tithes of all that I possess.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.13">And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his
eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying:  O god, be merciful to me
a sinner.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.14">I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the
other:  because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled:  and he that
humbleth himself, shall be exalted.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.15">And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them.  Which
when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.16">But Jesus, calling them together, said:  Suffer children to come to me,
and forbid them not:  for of such is the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.17">Amen, I say to you:  Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a
child, shall not enter into it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying:  Good master, what shall I do to
possess everlasting life?

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.19">And Jesus said to him:  Why dost thou call me good?  None is good but God
alone.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.20">Thou knowest the commandments:  Thou shalt not kill:  Thou shalt not
commit adultery:  Thou shalt not steal:  Thou shalt not bear false witness:
Honour thy father and mother.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.21">Who said:  All these things have I kept from my youth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.22">Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him:  Yet one thing is wanting to
thee:  sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven:  and come, follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.23">He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.24">And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said:  How hardly shall they that
have riches enter into the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.25">For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for
a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.26">And they that heard it, said:  Who then can be saved?

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.27">He said to them:  The things that are impossible with men, are possible
with God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.28">Then Peter said:  Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.29">Who said to them:  Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left
house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's
sake,

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.30">Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to
come life everlasting.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.31">Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them:  Behold, we go up
to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the
prophets concerning the Son of man.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.32">For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and
scourged, and spit upon:

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.33">And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the
third day he shall rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.34">And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them,
and they understood not the things that were said.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.35">Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind
man sat by the way side, begging.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.36">And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.37">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.38">And he cried out, saying:  Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.39">And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace:
but he cried out much more:  Son of David, have mercy on me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.40">And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him.  And when he
was come near, he asked him,

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.41">Saying:  What wilt thou that I do to thee?  But he said:  Lord, that I
may see.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.42">And Jesus said to him:  Receive thy sight:  thy faith hath made thee
whole.

</p>
               <p n="N3.18.43">And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God.  And all the
people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.2">And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the
publicans, and he was rich.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.3">And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and he could not for the crowd,
because he was low of stature.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.4">And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see
him; for he was to pass that way.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.5">And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to
him:  Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy
house.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.6">And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.7">And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a
guest with a man that was a sinner.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.8">But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord:  Behold, Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore
him fourfold.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.9">Jesus said to him:  This day is salvation come to this house, because he
also is a son of Abraham.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.10">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.11">As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because
he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God
should immediately be manifested.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.12">He said therefore:  A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive
for himself a kingdom, and to return.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.13">And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them:
Trade till I come.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.14">But his citizens hated him:  and they sent an embassage after him,
saying:  We will not have this man to reign over us.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.15">And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom:  and
he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he
might know how much every man had gained by trading.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.16">And the first came, saying:  Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.17">And he said to him:  Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been
faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.18">And the second came, saying:  Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.19">And he said to him:  Be thou also over five cities.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.20">And another came, saying:  Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have
kept laid up in a napkin;

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.21">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man:  thou takest up what
thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.22">He saith to him:  Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked
servant.  Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not
down, and reaping that which I did not sow:

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.23">And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my
coming, I might have exacted it with usury?

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.24">And he said to them that stood by:  Take the pound away from him, and give
it to him that hath ten pounds.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.25">And they said to him:  Lord, he hath ten pounds.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.26">But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall
abound:  and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken
from him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.27">But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring
them hither, and kill them before me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.28">And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.29">And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto
the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.30">Saying:  Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering
into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath
sitten:  loose him, and bring him hither.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.31">And if any man shall ask you:  Why do you loose him?  you shall say thus
unto him:  Because the Lord hath need of his service.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.32">And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as
he had said unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.33">And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them:  Why
loose you the colt?

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.34">But they said:  Because the Lord hath need of him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.35">And they brought him to Jesus.  And casting their garments on the colt,
they set Jesus thereon.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.36">And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.37">And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole
multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for
all the mighty works they had seen,

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.38">Saying:  Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in
heaven, and glory on high!

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.39">And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him:
Master, rebuke thy disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.40">To whom he said:  I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the
stones will cry out.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.41">And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.42">If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are
to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.43">For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench
about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.44">And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee:  and
they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone:  because thou hast not known
the time of thy visitation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.45">And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein,
and them that bought.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.46">Saying to them:  It is written:  My house is the house of prayer.  But
you have made it a den of thieves.

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.47">And he was teaching daily in the temple.  And the chief priests and the
scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:

</p>
               <p n="N3.19.48">And they found not what to do to him:  for all the people were very
attentive to hear him.

               <head>Chapter 20</head>
               <p n="N3.20.1">And it came to pass, that on one of the days, as he was teaching the
people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the
scribes, with the ancients, met together,

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.2">And spoke to him, saying:  Tell us, by what authority dost thou these
things?  or, Who is he that hath given thee this authority?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.3">And Jesus answering, said to them:  I will also ask you one thing.  Answer
me:

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.4">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.5">But they thought within themselves, saying:   If we shall say, From
heaven:   he will say:   Why then did you not believe him?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.6">But if we say, Of men, the whole people will stone us:   for they
are persuaded that John was a prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.7">And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.8">And Jesus said to them:   Neither do I tell thee by what authority
I do these things.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.9">And he began to speak to the people this parable:   A certain man planted
a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen:   and he was abroad for a long time.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.10">And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. Who, beating him,
sent him away empty.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.11">And again he sent another servant. But they beat him also, and
treating him reproachfully, sent him away empty.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.12">And again he sent the third:   and they wounded him also, and cast
him out.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.13">Then the lord of the vineyard said:   What shall I do? I will send
my beloved son:   it may be, when they see him, they will reverence
him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.14">Whom when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves,
saying:   This is the heir, let us kill him, that the inheritance
may be ours.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.15">So casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore
will the lord of the vineyard do to them?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.16">He will come, and will destroy these husbandmen, and will give
the vineyard to others. Which they hearing, said to him:   God forbid.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.17">But he looking on them, said:   What is this then that is written,
The stone, which the builders rejected, the same is become the
head of the corner?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.18">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be bruised:   and upon
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.19">And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him
the same hour:   but they feared the people, for they knew that he
spoke this parable to them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.20">And being upon the watch, they sent spies, who should feign
themselves just, that they might take hold of him in his words,
that they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the
governor.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.21">And they asked him, saying:   Master, we know that thou speakest
and teachest rightly:   and thou dost not respect any person, but
teachest the way of God in truth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.23">But he considering their guile, said to them:   Why tempt you me?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.24">Shew me a penny. Whose image and inscription hath it? They
answering, said to him, Caesar's.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.25">And he said to them:   Render therefore to Caesar the things that
are Caesar's:   and to God the things that are God's.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.26">And they could not reprehend his word before the people:   and
wondering at his answer, they held their peace.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.27">And there came to him some of the Sadducees, who deny that there
is any resurrection, and they asked him,

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.28">Saying:   Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,
having a wife, and he leave no children, that his brother should
take her to wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.29">There were therefore seven brethren:   and the first took a wife,
and died without children.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.30">And the next took her to wife, and he also died childless.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.31">And the third took her. And in like manner all the seven, and
they left no children, and died.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.32">Last of all the woman died also.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.33">In the resurrection therefore, whose wife of them shall she be?
For all the seven had her to wife.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.34">And Jesus said to them:   The children of this world marry, and
are given in marriage:

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.35">But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world, and of
the resurrection from the dead, shall neither be married, nor
take wives.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.36">Neither can they die any more:   for they are equal to the angels,
and are the children of God, being the children of the
resurrection.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.37">Now that the dead rise again, Moses also shewed, at the bush,
when he called the Lord, The God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob;

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.38">For he is not the God of the dead, but of the living:   for all
live to him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.39">And some of the scribes answering, said to him:   Master, thou
hast said well.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.40">And after that they durst not ask him any more questions.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.41">But he said to them:   How say they that Christ is the son of David?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.42">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms:   The Lord said to
my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.43">Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.44">David then calleth him Lord:   and how is he his son?

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.45">And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples:

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.46">Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and
love salutations in the marketplace, and the first chairs in the
synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts:

</p>
               <p n="N3.20.47">Who devour the houses of widows, feigning long prayer. These
shall receive greater damnation.

treasury.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.2">And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in two brass mites.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.3">And he said:   Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast
in more than they all:

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.4">For all these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of
God:   but she of her want, hath cast in all the living that she
had.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.5">And some saying of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts, he said:

shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown
down.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.7">And they asked him, saying:  Master, when shall these things be?
and what shall be the sign when they shall begin to come to pass?

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.8">Who said:  Take heed you be not seduced; for many will come in my
name, saying, I am he; and the time is at hand:  go ye not
therefore after them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.9">And when you shall hear of wars and seditions, be not terrified:
these things must first come to pass; but the end is not yet
presently.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.10">Then he said to them:  Nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.11">And there shall be great earthquakes in divers places, and
pestilences, and famines, and terrors from heaven; and there
shall be great signs.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.12">But before all these things, they will lay their hands upon you,
and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and into
prisons, dragging you before kings and governors, for my name's
sake.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.13">And it shall happen unto you for a testimony.

</p>
               <p n="N3.21.14">Lay it up therefore into your hearts, not to meditate before
how you shall answer:

at hand.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.2">And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put
Jesus to death:  but they feared the people.

necessary that the pasch should be killed.

               <p n="N3.22.8">And he sent Peter and John, saying:  Go, and prepare for us the
pasch, that we may eat.

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.10">And he said to them:  Behold, as you go into the city, there shall
meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water:  follow him into the

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.11">And you shall say to the goodman of the house:  The master saith to
thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with
my disciples?

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.12">And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there
prepare.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.13">And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the
pasch.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.14">And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
with him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.15">And he said to them:  With desire I have desired to eat this pasch
with you, before I suffer.

               <p n="N3.22.24">And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should
seem to be the greater.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.25">And he said to them:  The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them;
and they that have power over them, are called beneficent.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.26">But you not so:  but he that is the greater among you, let him become
as the younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.27">For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth?
Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as
he that serveth:

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.28">And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.29">And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.30">That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom:  and may sit
upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.31">And the Lord said:  Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have
you, that he may sift you as wheat:

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.32">But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:  and thou,
being once converted, confirm thy brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.33">Who said to him:  Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison,
and to death.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.34">And he said:  I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day,
till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.35">When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want
anything?

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.36">But they said:  Nothing. Then said he unto them:  But now he that hath
a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not,
let him sell his coat, and buy a sword.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.37">For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in
me:  And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning
me have an end.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.38">But they said:  Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them,
It is enough.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.39">And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of
Olives. And his disciples also followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.40">And when he was come to the place, he said to them:  Pray, lest ye
enter into temptation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.41">And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast; and kneeling
down, he prayed,

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.42">Saying:  Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me:  but yet
not my will, but thine be done.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.43">And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.44">And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the
ground.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.45">And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he
found them sleeping for sorrow.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.46">And he said to them:  Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter
into temptation.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.47">As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called
Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus,
for to kiss him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.48">And Jesus said to him:  Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with
a kiss?

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.49">And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him:
Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off
his right ear.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.51">But Jesus answering, said:  Suffer ye thus far. And when he had
touched his ear, he healed him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.52">And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple,
and the ancients, that were come unto him:  Are ye come out, as it
were against a thief, with swords and clubs?

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.53">When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth
your hands against me:  but this is your hour, and the power of
darkness.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.54">And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But
Peter followed afar off.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.55">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were
sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.56">Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and
had earnestly beheld him, she said:  This man also was with him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.57">But he denied him, saying:  Woman, I know him not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.58">And after a little while, another seeing him, said:  Thou also art
one of them. But Peter said:  O man, I am not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.59">And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man
affirmed, saying:  Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he
is also a Galilean.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.60">And Peter said:  Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately,
as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.61">And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word
of the Lord, as he had said:  Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny
me thrice.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.62">And Peter going out, wept bitterly.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.63">And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.64">And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him,
saying:  Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.65">And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.66">And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the
chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into
their council, saying:  If thou be the Christ, tell us.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.67">And he saith to them:  If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.68">And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.69">But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of
the power of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.70">Then said they all:  Art thou then the Son of God? Who said:  You say
that I am.

</p>
               <p n="N3.22.71">And they said:  What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves
have heard it from his own mouth.

               <head>Chapter 23</head>
               <p n="N3.23.1">And the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.2">And they began to accuse him, saying:  We have found this man
perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,
and saying that he is Christ the king.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.3">And Pilate asked him, saying:  Art thou the king of the Jews? But he
answering, said:  Thou sayest it.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.4">And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes:  I find
no cause in this man.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.5">But they were more earnest, saying:  He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.6">But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.7">And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent
him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.8">And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a
long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and
he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.9">And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing
him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.11">And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting
on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.12">And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before
they were enemies one to another.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.13">And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates,
and the people,

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.14">Said to them:  You have presented unto me this man, as one that
perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you,
find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.15">No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing
worthy of death is done to him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.16">I will chastise him therefore, and release him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.17">Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.18">But the whole multitude together cried out, saying:  Away with this
man, and release unto us Barabbas:

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.19">Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was
cast into prison.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.20">And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.21">But they cried again, saying:  Crucify him, crucify him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.22">And he said to them the third time:  Why, what evil hath this man
done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore,
and let him go.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.23">But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be
crucified; and their voices prevailed.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.25">And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been
cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up
to their will.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.26">And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene,
coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry
after Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.27">And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women,
who bewailed and lamented him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.28">But Jesus turning to them, said:  Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.29">For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say:  Blessed are
the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that
have not given suck.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains:  Fall upon us; and
to the hills:  Cover us.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.31">For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done
in the dry?

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.32">And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put
to death.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.33">And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they
crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and
the other on the left.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.34">And Jesus said:  Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.35">And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided
him, saying:  He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the elect of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him
vinegar,

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.37">And saying:  If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.38">And there was also a superscription written over him in letters
of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew:  THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.39">And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying:
If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.40">But the other answering, rebuked him, saying:  Neither dost thou
fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation?

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.41">And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds;
but this man hath done no evil.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.42">And he said to Jesus:  Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into
thy kingdom.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.43">And Jesus said to him:  Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be
with me in paradise.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.44">And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all
the earth until the ninth hour.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
the midst.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.46">And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said:  Father, into thy
hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.47">Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying:
Indeed this was a just man.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.48">And all the multitude of them that were come together to that
sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their
breasts.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.50">And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a
good and just man,

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.51">(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of
Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom
of God.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.52">This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.53">And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him
in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man
had been laid.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.54">And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.55">And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following
after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

</p>
               <p n="N3.23.56">And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the
sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment.

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="n3.24" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter 24</head>
               <p n="N3.24.1">And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they
came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.2">And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.3">And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.4">And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this,
behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down their countenance towards
the ground, they said unto them:  Why seek you the living with the
dead?

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.6">He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when
he was in Galilee,

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.7">Saying:  The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.8">And they remembered his words.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.9">And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to
the eleven, and to all the rest.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.10">And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the
other women that were with them, who told these things to the
apostles.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.11">And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not
believe them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.12">But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he
saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering
in himself at that which was come to pass.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.13">And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was
sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.15">And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with
themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.16">But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.17">And he said to them:  What are these discourses that you hold
one with another as you walk, and are sad?

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said
to him:  Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known
the things that have been done there in these days?

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.19">To whom he said:  What things? And they said:  Concerning Jesus of
Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God
and all the people;

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.20">And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be
condemned to death, and crucified him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.21">But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel:
and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these
things were done.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.22">Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who
before it was light, were at the sepulchre,

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.23">And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen
a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.24">And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as
the women had said, but him they found not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.25">Then he said to them:  O foolish, and slow of heart to believe
in all things which the prophets have spoken.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter
into his glory?

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to
them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.28">And they drew night to the town, whither they were going:  and
he made as though he would go farther.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.29">But they constrained him; saying:  Stay with us, because it is
towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in
with them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.30">And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took
bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him:  and he vanished
out of their sight.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.32">And they said one to the other:  Was not our heart burning within
us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.33">And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem:  and
they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were
staying with them,

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.34">Saying:  The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.35">And they told what things were done in the way; and how they
knew him in the breaking of the bread.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.36">Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the
midst of them, and saith to them:  Peace be to you; it is I, fear
not.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.37">But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw
a spirit.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.38">And he said to them:  Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts?

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.39">See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see:
for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.40">And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.41">But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said:
Have you any thing to eat?

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.42">And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.43">And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave
to them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.44">And he said to them:  These are the words which I spoke to you,
while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled,
which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and
in the psalms, concerning me.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.45">Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand
the scriptures.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.46">And he said to them:  Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third
day:

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.47">And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his
name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.48">And you are witnesses of these things.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.49">And I send the promise of my Father upon you:  but stay you in
the city till you be endued with power from on high.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.50">And he led them out as far as Bethania:  and lifting up his hands,
he blessed them.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.51">And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from
them, and was carried up to heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.52">And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.

</p>
               <p n="N3.24.53">And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God.
Amen.

               <head>Chapter 1</head>
               <p n="N4.1.1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.2">The same was in the beginning with God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.3">All things were made by him:  and without him was made nothing that
was made.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.5">And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend
it.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.7">This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men
might believe through him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.8">He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.9">That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into
this world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
knew him not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.11">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.12">But as many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons
of God, to them that believe in his name.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.13">Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
of man, but of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we saw his
glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father,) full of
grace and truth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.15">John beareth witness of him, and crieth out, saying:   This was he of whom
I spoke:   He that shall come after me, is preferred before me:   because he
was before me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.16">And of his fulness we all have received, and grace for grace.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.17">For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.18">No man hath seen God at any time:   the only begotten Son who is in the
bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.19">And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem
priests and Levites to him, to ask him:   Who art thou?

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.20">And he confessed, and did not deny:   and he confessed:   I am not the
Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.21">And they asked him:   What then?  Art thou Elias?  And he said:   I am not.
Art thou the prophet?  And he answered:   No.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.22">They said therefore unto him:   Who art thou, that we may give an answer
to them that sent us?  What sayest thou of thyself?

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.23">He said:   I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, make straight
the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaias.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.24">And they that were sent, were of the Pharisees.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.25">And they asked him, and said to him:   Why then dost thou baptize, if thou
be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.26">John answered them, saying:   I baptize with water; but there hath stood
one in the midst of you, whom you know not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.27">The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred before me:   the
latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.28">These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where John was
baptizing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.29">The next day, John saw Jesus coming to him, and he saith:   Behold the
Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sin of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.30">This is he, of whom I said:   After me there cometh a man, who is
preferred before me:   because he was before me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.31">And I knew him not, but that he may be made manifest in Israel,
therefore am I come baptizing with water.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.32">And John gave testimony, saying:   I saw the Spirit coming down, as a
dove from heaven, and he remained upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.33">And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptize with water, said to
me:   He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining
upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.34">And I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.35">The next day again John stood, and two of his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.36">And beholding Jesus walking, he saith:   Behold the Lamb of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.38">And Jesus turning, and seeing them following him, saith to them:   What
seek you?  Who said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted,
Master,) where dwellest thou?

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.39">He saith to them:   Come and see.  They came, and saw where he abode,
and they stayed with him that day:   now it was about the tenth hour.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.40">And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had
heard of John, and followed him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.41">He findeth first his brother Simon, and saith to him:   We have found the
Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.42">And he brought him to Jesus.  And Jesus looking upon him, said:   Thou art
Simon the son of Jona:   thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted
Peter.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.43">On the following day, he would go forth into Galilee, and he findeth
Philip.  And Jesus saith to him:  Follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him:  We have found him of whom
Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus the son of Joseph of
Nazareth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.46">And Nathanael said to him:  Can any thing of good come from Nazareth?
Philip saith to him:  Come and see.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him:  and he saith of him:  Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.48">Nathanael saith to him:  Whence knowest thou me?  Jesus answered, and
said to him:  Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig
tree, I saw thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.49">Nathanael answered him, and said:  Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou
art the King of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.50">Jesus answered, and said to him:  Because I said unto thee, I saw thee
under the fig tree, thou believest:  greater things than these shalt thou
see.

</p>
               <p n="N4.1.51">And he saith to him:  Amen, amen I say to you, you shall see the heaven
opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
man.

               <head>Chapter 2</head>
               <p n="N4.2.1">And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee:  and the
mother of Jesus was there.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.2">And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.3">And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him:  They have no
wine.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.4">And Jesus saith to her:  Woman, what is that to me and to thee?  my hour
is not yet come.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.5">His mother saith to the waiters:  Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.6">Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the
manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures
apiece.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.7">Jesus saith to them:  Fill the waterpots with water.  And they filled them
up to the brim.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.8">And Jesus saith to them:  Draw out now, and carry to the chief steward of
the feast.  And they carried it.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.9">And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine, and knew
not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had drawn the water; the
chief steward calleth the bridegroom,

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.10">And saith to him:  Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when
men have well drunk, then that which is worse.  But thou hast kept the
good wine until now.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.11">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee; and manifested
his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.12">After this he went down to Capharnaum, he and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples:  and they remained there not many days.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.13">And the pasch of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.14">And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and
the changers of money sitting.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.15">And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little cords, he drove
them all out of the temple, the sheep also and the oxen, and the money of
the changers he poured out, and the tables he overthrew.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.16">And to them that sold doves he said:  Take these things hence, and make
not the house of my Father a house of traffic.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.17">And his disciples remembered, that it was written:  The zeal of thy house
hath eaten me up.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.18">The Jews, therefore, answered, and said to him:  What sign dost thou
shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.19">Jesus answered, and said to them:  Destroy this temple, and in three days
I will raise it up.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.20">The Jews then said:  Six and forty years was this temple in building; and
wilt thou raise it up in three days?

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.21">But he spoke of the temple of his body.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.22">When therefore he was risen again from the dead, his disciples
remembered, that he had said this, and they believed the scripture, and
the word that Jesus had said.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.23">Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the pasch, upon the festival day,
many believed in his name, seeing his signs which he did.

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.24">But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,

</p>
               <p n="N4.2.25">And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man:  for he
knew what was in man.

               <p n="N4.3.1">And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.2">This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him:  Rabbi, we know that
thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which
thou dost, unless God be with him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.3">Jesus answered, and said to him:  Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a
man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.4">Nicodemus saith to him:  How can a man be born when he is old?  can he
enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born again?

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.5">Jesus answered:  Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again
of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.6">That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit, is spirit.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.7">Wonder not, that I said to thee, you must be born again.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.8">The Spirit breatheth where he will; and thou hearest his voice, but thou
knowest not whence he cometh, and whither he goeth:  so is every one
that is born of the Spirit.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.9">Nicodemus answered, and said to him:  How can these things be done?

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.10">Jesus answered, and said to him:  Art thou a master in Israel, and
knowest not these things?

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.11">Amen, amen I say to thee, that we speak what we know, and we testify
what we have seen, and you receive not our testimony.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.12">If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not; how will you
believe, if I shall speak to you heavenly things?

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.13">And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from
heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man
be lifted up:

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.15">That whosoever believeth in him, may not perish; but may have life
everlasting.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.16">For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that
whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life
everlasting.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.17">For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the
world may be saved by him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.18">He that believeth in him is not judged.  But he that doth not believe, is
already judged:  because he believeth not in the name of the only
begotten Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.19">And this is the judgment:  because the light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than the light:  for their works were evil.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.20">For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the
light, that his works may not be reproved.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.21">But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his works may be made
manifest, because they are done in God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.22">After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea:
and there he abode with them, and baptized.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.23">And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim; because there was
much water there; and they came and were baptized.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.24">For John was not yet cast into prison.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.25">And there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the
Jews concerning purification:

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.26">And they came to John, and said to him:  Rabbi, he that was with thee
beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth,
and all men come to him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.27">John answered, and said:  A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be
given him from heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.28">You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not Christ, but that
I am sent before him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.29">He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom:  but the friend of the
bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of
the bridegroom's voice.  This my joy therefore is fulfilled.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.30">He must increase, but I must decrease.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.31">He that cometh from above, is above all.  He that is of the earth, of the
earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh.  He that cometh from heaven, is
above all.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.32">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth:  and no man
receiveth his testimony.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.33">He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God
is true.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.34">For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God:  for God doth
not give the Spirit by measure.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.35">The Father loveth the Son:  and he hath given all things into his hand.

</p>
               <p n="N4.3.36">He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting; but he that believeth
not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

               <p n="N4.4.1">When Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.2">(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.3">He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.4">And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.5">He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the
land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.6">Now Jacob's well was there.  Jesus therefore being wearied with his
journey, sat thus on the well.  It was about the sixth hour.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.7">There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water.  Jesus saith to her:
Give me to drink.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.8">For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.9">Then that Samaritan woman saith to him:  How dost thou, being a Jew,
ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman?  For the Jews do not
communicate with the Samaritans.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.10">Jesus answered, and said to her:  If thou didst know the gift of God, and
who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have
asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.11">The woman saith to him:  Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the
well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.13">Jesus answered, and said to her:  Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall
thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him,
shall not thirst for ever:

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.14">But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of
water, springing up into life everlasting.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.15">The woman saith to him:  Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst,
nor come hither to draw.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.16">Jesus saith to her:  Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.17">The woman answered, and said:  I have no husband.  Jesus said to her:
Thou hast said well, I have no husband:

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.18">For thou hast had five husbands:  and he whom thou now hast, is not thy
husband.  This thou hast said truly.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.19">The woman saith to him:  Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.20">Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the
place where men must adore.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.21">Jesus saith to her:  Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you
shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.22">You adore that which you know not:  we adore that which we know; for
salvation is of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the
Father in spirit and in truth.  For the Father also seeketh such to adore
him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.24">God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in
truth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.25">The woman saith to him:  I know that the Messias cometh (who is called
Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.26">Jesus saith to her:  I am he, who am speaking with thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.27">And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked
with the woman.  Yet no man said:  What seekest thou?  or, why talkest
thou with her?

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.28">The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city,
and saith to the men there:

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.29">Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done.
Is not he the Christ?

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.30">They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.31">In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying:  Rabbi, eat.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.32">But he said to them:  I have meat to eat, which you know not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.33">The disciples therefore said one to another:  Hath any man brought him to
eat?

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.34">Jesus saith to them:  My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that
I may perfect his work.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.35">Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh?
Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they
are white already to harvest.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.36">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life
everlasting:  that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice
together.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.37">For in this is the saying true:  That it is one man that soweth, and it is
another that reapeth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.38">I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour:  others have
laboured, and you have entered into their labours.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.39">Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of
the woman giving testimony:  He told me all things whatsoever I have
done.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.40">So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would
tarry there.  And he abode there two days.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.41">And many more believed in him because of his own word.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.42">And they said to the woman:  We now believe, not for thy saying:  for we
ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the
world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.43">Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.44">For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his
own country.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.45">And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having
seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they
also went to the festival day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.46">He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water
wine.  And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at
Capharnaum.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.47">He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to
him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the
point of death.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.48">Jesus therefore said to him:  Unless you see signs and wonders, you
believe not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.49">The ruler saith to him:  Lord, come down before that my son die.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.50">Jesus saith to him:  Go thy way; thy son liveth.  The man believed the
word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.51">And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word,
saying, that his son lived.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.52">He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better.  And they
said to him:  Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.53">The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to
him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.

</p>
               <p n="N4.4.54">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of
Judea into Galilee.

               <head>Chapter 5</head>
               <p n="N4.5.1">After these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.2">Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is
named Bethsaida, having five porches.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.3">In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered;
waiting for the moving of the water.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.4">And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and
the water was moved.  And he that went down first into the pond after the
motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay
under.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.5">And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years
under his infirmity.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.6">Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long
time, he saith to him:  Wilt thou be made whole?

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.7">The infirm man answered him:  Sir, I have no man, when the water is
troubled, to put me into the pond.  For whilst I am coming, another goeth
down before me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.8">Jesus saith to him:  Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.9">And immediately the man was made whole:  and he took up his bed, and
walked.  And it was the sabbath that day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.10">The Jews therefore said to him that was healed:  It is the sabbath; it is
not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.11">He answered them:  He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy
bed, and walk.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.12">They asked him therefore:  Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy
bed, and walk?

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.13">But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from
the multitude standing in the place.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.14">Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him:  Behold
thou art made whole:  sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.15">The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had
made him whole.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.16">Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on
the sabbath.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.17">But Jesus answered them:  My Father worketh until now; and I work.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.18">Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did
not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making
himself equal to God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.19">Then Jesus answered, and said to them:  Amen, amen, I say unto you, the
Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing:
for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.20">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself
doth:  and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may
wonder.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.21">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life:  so the Son also
giveth life to whom he will.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.22">For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to
the Son.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.23">That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father.  He who
honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.24">Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth
him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment,
but is passed from death to life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.25">Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the
dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear
shall live.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.26">For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to
have life in himself:

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.27">And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of
man.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.28">Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the
graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.29">And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the
resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection
of judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.30">I cannot of myself do any thing.  As I hear, so I judge:  and my judgment is
just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.31">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.32">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness
which he witnesseth of me is true.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.33">You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.34">But I receive not testimony from man:  but I say these things, that you
may be saved.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.35">He was a burning and a shining light:  and you were willing for a time to
rejoice in his light.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.36">But I have a greater testimony than that of John:  for the works which the
Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give
testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.37">And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given testimony of me:
neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.38">And you have not his word abiding in you:  for whom he hath sent, him
you believe not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.39">Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and
the same are they that give testimony of me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.40">And you will not come to me that you may have life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.41">I receive glory not from men.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.42">But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.43">I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not:  if another
shall come in his own name, him you will receive.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.44">How can you believe, who receive glory one from another:  and the glory
which is from God alone, you do not seek?

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.45">Think not that I will accuse you to the Father.  There is one that accuseth
you, Moses, in whom you trust.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.46">For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he
wrote of me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.5.47">But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?

               <p n="N4.6.1">After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is that of
Tiberias.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.2">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles
which he did on them that were diseased.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.3">Jesus therefore went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.4">Now the pasch, the festival day of the Jews, was near at hand.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.5">When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes, and seen that a very great
multitude cometh to him, he said to Philip:  Whence shall we buy bread,
that these may eat?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.6">And this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he would do.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.7">Philip answered him:  Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient
for them, that every one may take a little.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.8">One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, saith to him:

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.9">There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two fishes; but what
are these among so many?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.10">Then Jesus said:  Make the men sit down.  Now there was much grass in
the place.  The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.11">And Jesus took the loaves:  and when he had given thanks, he distributed
to them that were set down.  In like manner also of the fishes, as much as
they would.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.12">And when they were filled, he said to his disciples:  Gather up the
fragments that remain, lest they be lost.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.13">They gathered up therefore, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments
of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that
had eaten.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.14">Now those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done,
said:  This is of a truth the prophet, that is to come into the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.15">Jesus therefore, when he knew that they would come to take him by
force, and make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.16">And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.17">And when they had gone up into a ship, they went over the sea to
Capharnaum; and it was now dark, and Jesus was not come unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.18">And the sea arose, by reason of a great wind that blew.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.19">When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
they see Jesus walking upon the sea, and drawing nigh to the ship, and
they were afraid.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.20">But he saith to them:  It is I; be not afraid.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.21">They were willing therefore to take him into the ship; and presently the
ship was at the land to which they were going.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.22">The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, saw
that there was no other ship there but one, and that Jesus had not entered
into the ship with his disciples, but that his disciples were gone away
alone.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.23">But other ships came in from Tiberias; nigh unto the place where they
had eaten the bread, the Lord giving thanks.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.24">When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his
disciples, they took shipping, and came to Capharnaum, seeking for
Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.25">And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to
him:  Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.26">Jesus answered them, and said:  Amen, amen I say to you, you seek me,
not because you have seen miracles, but because you did eat of the
loaves, and were filled.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.27">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth
unto life everlasting, which the Son of man will give you.  For him hath
God, the Father, sealed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.28">They said therefore unto him:  What shall we do, that we may work the
works of God?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.29">Jesus answered, and said to them:  This is the work of God, that you
believe in him whom he hath sent.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.30">They said therefore to him:  What sign therefore dost thou shew, that we
may see, and may believe thee?  What dost thou work?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.31">Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written:  He gave them
bread from heaven to eat.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.32">Then Jesus said to them:  Amen, amen I say to you; Moses gave you not
bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from
heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.33">For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven, and giveth
life to the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.34">They said therefore unto him:  Lord, give us always this bread.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.35">And Jesus said to them:  I am the bread of life:  he that cometh to me shall
not hunger:  and he that believeth in me shall never thirst.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.36">But I said unto you, that you also have seen me, and you believe not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.37">All that the Father giveth to me shall come to me; and him that cometh to
me, I will not cast out.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.38">Because I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of
him that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.39">Now this is the will of the Father who sent me:  that of all that he hath
given me, I should lose nothing; but should raise it up again in the last
day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.40">And this is the will of my Father that sent me:  that every one who seeth
the Son, and believeth in him, may have life everlasting, and I will raise
him up in the last day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.41">The Jews therefore murmured at him, because he had said:  I am the
living bread which came down from heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.42">And they said:  Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and
mother we know?  How then saith he, I came down from heaven?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.43">Jesus therefore answered, and said to them:  Murmur not among
yourselves.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.44">No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath sent me, draw
him; and I will raise him up in the last day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.45">It is written in the prophets:  And they shall all be taught of God.  Every
one that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.46">Not that any man hath seen the Father; but he who is of God, he hath
seen the Father.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.47">Amen, amen I say unto you:  He that believeth in me, hath everlasting life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.48">I am the bread of life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.49">Your fathers did eat manna in the desert, and are dead.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.50">This is the bread which cometh down from heaven; that if any man eat of
it, he may not die.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.51">I am the living bread which came down from heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.52">If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that
I will give, is my flesh, for the life of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.53">The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying:  How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.54">Then Jesus said to them:  Amen, amen I say unto you:  Except you eat the
flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in
you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.55">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath everlasting life:  and
I will raise him up in the last day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.56">For my flesh is meat indeed:  and my blood is drink indeed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.57">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in
him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.58">As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that
eateth me, the same also shall live by me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.59">This is the bread that came down from heaven.  Not as your fathers did
eat manna, and are dead.  He that eateth this bread, shall live for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.60">These things he said, teaching in the synagogue, in Capharnaum.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.61">Many therefore of his disciples, hearing it, said:  This saying is hard,
and who can hear it?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.62">But Jesus, knowing in himself, that his disciples murmured at this, said
to them:  Doth this scandalize you?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.63">If then you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.64">It is the spirit that quickeneth:  the flesh profiteth nothing.  The words
that I have spoken to you, are spirit and life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.65">But there are some of you that believe not.  For Jesus knew from the
beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who he was, that
would betray him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.66">And he said:  Therefore did I say to you, that no man can come to me,
unless it be given him by my Father.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.67">After this many of his disciples went back; and walked no more with him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.68">Then Jesus said to the twelve:  Will you also go away?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.69">And Simon Peter answered him:  Lord, to whom shall we go?  thou hast
the words of eternal life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.70">And we have believed and have known, that thou art the Christ, the Son
of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.71">Jesus answered them:  Have not I chosen you twelve; and one of you is a
devil?

</p>
               <p n="N4.6.72">Now he meant Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon:  for this same was about
to betray him, whereas he was one of the twelve.

               <head>Chapter 7</head>
               <p n="N4.7.1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in
Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.2">Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.3">And his brethren said to him:  Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that
thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.4">For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh
to be known openly.  If thou do these things, manifest thyself to
the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.5">For neither did his brethren believe in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.6">Then Jesus said to them:  My time is not yet come; but your time is
always ready.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth:  because I give testimony of
it, that the works thereof are evil.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.8">Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day:
because my time is not accomplished.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.9">When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.10">But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast,
not openly, but, as it were, in secret.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.11">The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said:  Where is
he?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.12">And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him.
For some said:  He is a good man.  And others said:  No, but he seduceth
the people.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.13">Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.14">Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and
taught.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.15">And the Jews wondered, saying:  How doth this man know letters, having
never learned?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.16">Jesus answered them, and said:  My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent
me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.17">If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it
be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.18">He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory:  but he that seeketh
the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in
him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.19">Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.20">Why seek you to kill me?  The multitude answered, and said:  Thou hast a
devil; who seeketh to kill thee?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.21">Jesus answered, and said to them:  One work I have done; and you all
wonder:

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.22">Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but
of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.23">If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses
may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the
whole man on the sabbath day?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.24">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.25">Some therefore of Jerusalem said:  Is not this he whom they seek to kill?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.26">And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him.  Have the
rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.27">But we know this man, whence he is:  but when the Christ cometh, no
man knoweth whence he is.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.28">Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying:  You both
know me, and you know whence I am:  and I am not come of myself; but
he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.29">I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.30">They sought therefore to apprehend him:  and no man laid hands on him,
because his hour was not yet come.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.31">But of the people many believed in him, and said:  When the Christ
cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.32">The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him:
and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.33">Jesus therefore said to them:  Yet a little while I am with you:  and then I
go to him that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.34">You shall seek me, and shall not find me:  and where I am, thither you
cannot come.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.35">The Jews therefore said among themselves:  Whither will he go, that we
shall not find him?  will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and
teach the Gentiles?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.36">What is this saying that he hath said:  You shall seek me, and shall not
find me; and where I am, you cannot come?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.37">And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried,
saying:  If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.38">He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall
flow rivers of living water.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.39">Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in
him:  for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet
glorified.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.40">Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his,
some said:  This is the prophet indeed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.41">Others said:  This is the Christ.  But some said:  Doth the Christ come out
of Galilee?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.42">Doth not the scripture say:  That Christ cometh of the seed of David,
and from Bethlehem the town where David was?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.43">So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.44">And some of them would have apprehended him:  but no man laid hands
on him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.45">The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees.  And
they said to them:  Why have you not brought him?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.46">The ministers answered:  Never did man speak like this man.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.47">The Pharisees therefore answered them:  Are you also seduced?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.48">Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.49">But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.50">Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of
them:)

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.51">Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he
doth?

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.52">They answered, and said to him:  Art thou also a Galilean?  Search the
scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.7.53">And every man returned to his own house.

               <head>Chapter 8</head>
               <p n="N4.8.1">And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the
people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.3">And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in
adultery:  and they set her in the midst,

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.4">And said to him:  Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.5">Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one.  But what
sayest thou?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.6">And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him.  But Jesus
bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.7">When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said
to them:  He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone
at her.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.8">And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.9">But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest.  And
Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.10">Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her:  Woman, where are they that
accused thee?  Hath no man condemned thee?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.11">Who said:  No man, Lord.  And Jesus said:  Neither will I condemn thee.
Go, and now sin no more.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.12">Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying:  I am the light of the world:
he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light
of life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.13">The Pharisees therefore said to him:  Thou givest testimony of thyself:  thy
testimony is not true.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.14">Jesus answered, and said to them:  Although I give testimony of myself,
my testimony is true:  for I know whence I came, and whither I go:  but
you know not whence I come, or whither I go.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.15">You judge according to the flesh:  I judge not any man.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.16">And if I do judge, my judgment is true:  because I am not alone, but I and
the Father that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.17">And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.18">I am one that give testimony of myself:  and the Father that sent me
giveth testimony of me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.19">They said therefore to him:  Where is thy Father?  Jesus answered:
Neither me do you know, nor my Father:  if you did know me, perhaps
you would know my Father also.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.20">These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple:  and no
man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.21">Again therefore Jesus said to them:  I go, and you shall seek me, and you
shall die in your sin.  Whither I go, you cannot come.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.22">The Jews therefore said:  Will he kill himself, because he said:  Whither I
go, you cannot come?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.23">And he said to them:  You are from beneath, I am from above.  You are of
this world, I am not of this world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.24">Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins.  For if you
believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.25">They said therefore to him:  Who art thou?  Jesus said to them:  The
beginning, who also speak unto you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.26">Many things I have to speak and to judge of you.  But he that sent me, is
true:  and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.27">And they understood not, that he called God his Father.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.28">Jesus therefore said to them:  When you shall have lifted up the Son of
man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself,
but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.29">And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone:  for I do
always the things that please him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.30">When he spoke these things, many believed in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.31">Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him:  If you continue in my
word, you shall be my disciples indeed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.32">And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.33">They answered him:  We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never
been slaves to any man:  how sayest thou:  you shall be free?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.34">Jesus answered them:  Amen, amen I say unto you:  that whosoever
committeth sin, is the servant of sin.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.35">Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for
ever.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.36">If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.37">I know that you are the children of Abraham:  but you seek to kill me,
because my word hath no place in you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.38">I speak that which I have seen with my Father:  and you do the things that
you have seen with your father.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.39">They answered, and said to him:  Abraham is our father.  Jesus saith to
them:  If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.40">But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you,
which I have heard of God.  This Abraham did not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.41">You do the works of your father.  They said therefore to him:  We are not
born of fornication:  we have one Father, even God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.42">Jesus therefore said to them:  If God were your Father, you would indeed
love me.  For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself,
but he sent me:

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.43">Why do you not know my speech?  Because you cannot hear my word.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.44">You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will
do.  He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth;
because truth is not in him.  When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his
own:  for he is a liar, and the father thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.45">But if I say the truth, you believe me not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.46">Which of you shall convince me of sin?  If I say the truth to you, why do
you not believe me?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.47">He that is of God, heareth the words of God.  Therefore you hear them
not, because you are not of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.48">The Jews therefore answered, and said to him:  Do not we say well that
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.49">Jesus answered:  I have not a devil:  but I honour my Father, and you have
dishonoured me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.50">But I seek not my own glory:  there is one that seeketh and judgeth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.51">Amen, amen I say to you:  If any man keep my word, he shall not see
death for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.52">The Jews therefore said:  Now we know that thou hast a devil.  Abraham
is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest:  If any man keep my word, he
shall not taste death for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead?  and the prophets
are dead.  Whom dost thou make thyself?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.54">Jesus answered:  If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.  It is my Father
that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.55">And you have not known him, but I know him.  And if I shall say that I
know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar.  But I do know him, and do
keep his word.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.56">Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day:  he saw it, and
was glad.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.57">The Jews therefore said to him:  Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast
thou seen Abraham?

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.58">Jesus said to them:  Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was
made, I am.

</p>
               <p n="N4.8.59">They took up stones therefore to cast at him.  But Jesus hid himself, and
went out of the temple.

               <head>Chapter 9</head>
               <p n="N4.9.1">And Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.2">And his disciples asked him:  Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his
parents, that he should be born blind?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.3">Jesus answered:  Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that
the works of God should be made manifest in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.4">I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day:  the night
cometh, when no man can work.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.6">When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of
the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.7">And said to him:  Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted,
Sent.  He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.8">The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was
a beggar, said:  Is not this he that sat and begged?  Some said:  This is he.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.9">But others said:  No, but he is like him.  But he said:  I am he.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.10">They said therefore to him:  How were thy eyes opened?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.11">He answered:  That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my
eyes, and said to me:  Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash.  And I went, I
washed, and I see.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.12">And they said to him:  Where is he?  He saith:  I know not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.13">They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.14">Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.15">Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight.
But he said to them:  He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said:  This man is not of God, who
keepeth not the sabbath.  But others said:  How can a man that is a sinner
do such miracles?  And there was a division among them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.17">They say therefore to the blind man again:  What sayest thou of him that
hath opened they eyes?  And he said:  He is a prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.18">The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind,
and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had
received his sight,

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.19">And asked them, saying:  Is this your son, who you say was born blind?
How then doth he now see?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.20">His parents answered them, and said:  We know that this is our son, and
that he was born blind:

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.21">But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we
know not:  ask himself:  he is of age, let him speak for himself.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.22">These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews:  for the
Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should
confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.23">Therefore did his parents say:  He is of age, ask himself.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.24">They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him:
Give glory to God.  We know that this man is a sinner.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.25">He said therefore to them:  If he be a sinner, I know not:  one thing I
know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.26">They said then to him:  What did he to thee?  How did he open thy eyes?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.27">He answered them:  I have told you already, and you have heard:  why
would you hear it again?  will you also become his disciples?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.28">They reviled him therefore, and said:  Be thou his disciple; but we are the
disciples of Moses.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.29">We know that God spoke to Moses:  but as to this man, we know not
from whence he is.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.30">The man answered, and said to them:  Why, herein is a wonderful thing,
that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.31">Now we know that God doth not hear sinners:  but if a man be a server of
God, and doth his will, him he heareth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.32">From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath
opened the eyes of one born blind.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.33">Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.34">They answered, and said to him:  Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost
thou teach us?  And they cast him out.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out:  and when he had found him, he
said to him:  Dost thou believe in the Son of God?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.36">He answered, and said:  Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.37">And Jesus said to him:  Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh
with thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.38">And he said:  I believe, Lord.  And falling down, he adored him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.39">And Jesus said:  For judgment I am come into this world; that they who
see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.40">And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard:  and they said
unto him:  Are we also blind?

</p>
               <p n="N4.9.41">Jesus said to them:  If you were blind, you should not have sin:  but now
you say:  We see.  Your sin remaineth.

sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.2">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.3">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice:  and he calleth
his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.4">And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them:  and the
sheep follow him, because they know his voice.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.5">But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not
the voice of strangers.

               <p n="N4.10.6">This proverb Jesus spoke to them.  But they understood not what he
spoke to them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.7">Jesus therefore said to them again:  Amen, amen I say to you, I am the
door of the sheep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.8">All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers:  and the
sheep heard them not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.9">I am the door.  By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved:  and he shall
go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.10">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy.  I am
come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.11">I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.12">But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep
are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth:  and the
wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.13">And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling:  and he hath no care for
the sheep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.14">I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.15">As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father:  and I lay down my

and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one
shepherd.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.17">Therefore doth the Father love me:  because I lay down my life, that I
may take it again.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.18">No man taketh it away from me:  but I lay it down of myself, and I have
power to lay it down:  and I have power to take it up again.  This
commandment have I received of my Father.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.19">A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.20">And many of them said:  He hath a devil, and is mad:  why hear you him?

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.21">Others said:  These are not the words of one that hath a devil:  Can a devil
open the eyes of the blind?

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.22">And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:  and it was winter.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.23">And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.24">The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him:  How long
dost thou hold our souls in suspense?  If thou be the Christ, tell us
plainly.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.25">Jesus answered them:  I speak to you, and you believe not:  the works that
I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.26">But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.27">My sheep hear my voice:  and I know them, and they follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.28">And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.31">The Jews then took up stones to stone him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.32">Jesus answered them:  Many good works I have shewed you from my
Father; for which of these works do you stone me?

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.33">The Jews answered him:  For a good work we stone thee not, but for
blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.34">Jesus answered them:  Is it not written in your law:  I said you are gods?

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.35">If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the
scripture cannot be broken;

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.36">Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the
world:  Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.38">But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works:  that you
may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.39">They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.40">And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was
baptizing first; and there he abode.

</p>
               <p n="N4.10.41">And many resorted to him, and they said:  John indeed did no sign.

               <p n="N4.10.42">But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true.  And many
believed in him.

               <p n="N4.11.1">Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the
town of Mary and Martha her sister.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.2">(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his
feet with her hair:  whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.3">His sisters therefore sent to him, saying:  Lord, behold, he whom thou
lovest is sick.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.4">And Jesus hearing it, said to them:  This sickness is not unto death, but
for the glory of God:  that the Son of God may be glorified by it.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.6">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the
same place two days.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.7">Then after that, he said to his disciples:  Let us go into Judea again.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.8">The disciples say to him:  Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee:
and goest thou thither again?

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.9">Jesus answered:  Are there not twelve hours of the day?  If a man walk in
the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.10">But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not
in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.11">These things he said; and after that he said to them:  Lazarus our friend
sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.12">His disciples therefore said:  Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.13">But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the
repose of sleep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.14">Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly:  Lazarus is dead.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.15">And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe:
but let us go to him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.16">Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples:  Let
us also go, that we may die with him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.17">Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in
the grave.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.18">(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.19">And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning their brother.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.20">Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to
meet him:  but Mary sat at home.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.21">Martha therefore said to Jesus:  Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.22">But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give
it thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.23">Jesus saith to her:  Thy brother shall rise again.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.24">Martha saith to him:  I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection
at the last day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.25">Jesus said to her:  I am the resurrection and the life:  he that believeth
in me, although he be dead, shall live:

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.26">And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever.
Believest thou this?

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.27">She saith to him:  Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son
of the living God, who art come into this world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.28">And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister
Mary secretly, saying:  The master is come, and calleth for thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.29">She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.30">For Jesus was not yet come into the town:  but he was still in that place
where Martha had met him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.31">The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her,
when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed
her, saying:  She goeth to the grave to weep there.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.32">When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell
down at his feet, and saith to him:  Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.33">Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were
come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.34">And said:  Where have you laid him?  They say to him:  Lord, come and
see.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.35">And Jesus wept.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.36">The Jews therefore said:  Behold how he loved him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.37">But some of them said:  Could not he that opened the eyes of the man
born blind, have caused that this man should not die?

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre.  Now
it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.39">Jesus saith:  Take away the stone.  Martha, the sister of him that was
dead, saith to him:  Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four
days.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.40">Jesus saith to her:  Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou
shalt see the glory of God?

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.41">They took therefore the stone away.  And Jesus lifting up his eyes said:
Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.42">And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who
stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.43">When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice:  Lazarus, come
forth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.44">And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands
with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin.  Jesus
said to them:  Loose him, and let him go.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.45">Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and
had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.46">But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that
Jesus had done.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.47">The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and
said:  What do we, for this man doth many miracles?

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.48">If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come,
and take away our place and nation.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.49">But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to
them:  You know nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.50">Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should
die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.51">And this he spoke not of himself:  but being the high priest of that year,
he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.52">And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of
God, that were dispersed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.53">From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.54">Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went
into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and
there he abode with his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.55">And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went
up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.

</p>
               <p n="N4.11.56">They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another,
standing in the temple:  What think you that he is not come to the festival
day?  And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that
if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend
him.

               <p n="N4.12.1">Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where
Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.2">And they made him a supper there:  and Martha served:  but Lazarus was
one of them that were at table with him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.3">Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great
price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair;
and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.4">Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray
him, said:

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the
poor?

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.6">Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was
a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.7">Jesus therefore said:  Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day
of my burial.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.8">For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.9">A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and
they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus,
whom he had raised from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.10">But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.11">Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in
Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.12">And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival
day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried:
Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of
Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.14">And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.15">Fear not, daughter of Sion:  behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's
colt.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.16">These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was
glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him,
and that they had done these things to him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.17">The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he
called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.18">For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they
heard that he had done this miracle.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves:  Do you see that we
prevail nothing?  behold, the whole world is gone after him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.20">Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on
the festival day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.21">These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and
desired him, saying:  Sir, we would see Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.22">Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew.  Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.23">But Jesus answered them, saying:  The hour is come, that the Son of man
should be glorified.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.24">Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground
die,

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.25">Itself remaineth alone.  But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.  He
that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this
world, keepeth it unto life eternal.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.26">If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also
shall my minister be.  If any man minister to me, him will my Father
honour.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.27">Now is my soul troubled.  And what shall I say?  Father, save me from this
hour.  But for this cause I came unto this hour.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.28">Father, glorify thy name.  A voice therefore came from heaven:  I have
both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.29">The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered.
Others said:  An angel spoke to him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.30">Jesus answered, and said:  This voice came not because of me, but for
your sakes.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.31">Now is the judgment of the world:  now shall the prince of this world be
cast out.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.33">(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.34">The multitude answered him:  We have heard out of the law, that Christ
abideth for ever; and how sayest thou:  The Son of man must be lifted up?
Who is this Son of man?

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.35">Jesus therefore said to them:  Yet a little while, the light is among you.
Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not.  And
he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.36">Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the
children of light.  These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid
himself from them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.37">And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed
not in him:

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.38">That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said:
Lord, who hath believed our hearing?  and to whom hath the arm of the
Lord been revealed?

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.39">Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again:

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.40">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should
not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be
converted, and I should heal them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.41">These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.42">However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the
Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the
synagogue.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.43">For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.44">But Jesus cried, and said:  He that believeth in me, doth not believe in
me, but in him that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.45">And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.46">I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not
remain in darkness.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.47">And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him:
for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.48">He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth
him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last
day.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.49">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me
commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.

</p>
               <p n="N4.12.50">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting.  The things
therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak.

               <head>Chapter 13</head>
               <p n="N4.13.1">Before the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was
come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father:  having loved
his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.2">And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of
Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,)

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.3">Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that
he came from God, and goeth to God;

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.4">He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a
towel, girded himself.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.5">After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of
the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.6">He cometh therefore to Simon Peter.  And Peter saith to him:  Lord, dost
thou wash my feet?

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.7">Jesus answered, and said to him:  What I do thou knowest not now; but
thou shalt know hereafter.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.8">Peter saith to him:  Thou shalt never wash my feet.  Jesus answered him:
If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.9">Simon Peter saith to him:  Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and
my head.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.10">Jesus saith to him:  He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet,
but is clean wholly.  And you are clean, but not all.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.11">For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said:  You
are not all clean.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.12">Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set
down again, he said to them:  Know you what I have done to you?

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.13">You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.14">If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also
ought to wash one another's feet.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.15">For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do
also.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.16">Amen, amen I say to you:  The servant is not greater than his lord; neither
is the apostle greater than he that sent him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.17">If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.18">I speak not of you all:  I know whom I have chosen.  But that the scripture
may be fulfilled:  He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel
against me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.19">At present I tell you, before it come to pass:  that when it shall come to
pass, you may believe that I am he.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.20">Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send,
receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.21">When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he
testified, and said:  Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.22">The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he
spoke.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.23">Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus
loved.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.24">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him:  Who is it of
whom he speaketh?

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.25">He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him:  Lord, who
is it?

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.26">Jesus answered:  He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped.  And when
he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.27">And after the morsel, Satan entered into him.  And Jesus said to him:  That
which thou dost, do quickly.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.28">Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.29">For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to
him:  Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day:  or that
he should give something to the poor.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.30">He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately.  And it
was night.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.31">When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said:  Now is the Son of man
glorified, and God is glorified in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.32">If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and
immediately will he glorify him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.33">Little children, yet a little while I am with you.  You shall seek me; and
as I said to the Jews:  Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.34">A new commandment I give unto you:  That you love one another, as I
have loved you, that you also love one another.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.35">By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one
for another.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.36">Simon Peter saith to him:  Lord, whither goest thou?  Jesus answered:
Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow
hereafter.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.37">Peter saith to him:  Why cannot I follow thee now?  I will lay down my life
for thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.13.38">Jesus answered him:  Wilt thou lay down thy life for me?  Amen, amen I
say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice.

will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.5">Thomas saith to him:  Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how
can we know the way?

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.6">Jesus saith to him:  I am the way, and the truth, and the life.  No man
cometh to the Father, but by me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.7">If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father
also:  and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.8">Philip saith to him:  Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.9">Jesus saith to him:  Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not
known me?  Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also.  How sayest
thou, Shew us the Father?

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.10">Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  The
words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself.  But the Father who
abideth in me, he doth the works.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.11">Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.12">Otherwise believe for the very works' sake.  Amen, amen I say to you, he
that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do; and greater
than these shall he do.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.13">Because I go to the Father:  and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in
my name, that will I do:  that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.14">If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.15">If you love me, keep my commandments.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.16">And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that
he may abide with you for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.17">The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him
not, nor knoweth him:  but you shall know him; because he shall abide
with you, and shall be in you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.18">I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.19">Yet a little while:  and the world seeth me no more.  But you see me:
because I live, and you shall live.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.20">In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I
in you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.21">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth
me.  And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father:  and I will love
him, and will manifest myself to him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.22">Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot:  Lord, how is it, that thou wilt
manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.23">Jesus answered, and said to him:  If any one love me, he will keep my
word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will
make our abode with him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.24">He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words.  And the word which you
have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.25">These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.26">But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind,
whatsoever I shall have said to you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.27">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you:  not as the world
giveth, do I give unto you.  Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be
afraid.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.28">You have heard that I said to you:  I go away, and I come unto you.  If you
loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father:  for the
Father is greater than I.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.29">And now I have told you before it comes to pass:  that when it shall come
to pass, you may believe.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.30">I will not now speak many things with you.  For the prince of this world
cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.14.31">But that the world may know, that I love the Father:  and as the Father
hath given me commandment, so do I:  Arise, let us go hence.

Whither goest thou?

you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.16.8">And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice,

               <p n="N4.18.5">They answered him:  Jesus of Nazareth.  Jesus saith to them:  I am he.
And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.6">As soon therefore as he had said to them:  I am he; they went backward,
and fell to the ground.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.7">Again therefore he asked them:  Whom seek ye?  And they said, Jesus of
Nazareth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.8">Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he.  If therefore you seek me,
let these go their way.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.9">That the word might be fulfilled which he said:  Of them whom thou hast
given me, I have not lost any one.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.10">Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the
high priest, and cut off his right ear.  And the name of the servant was
Malchus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.11">Jesus therefore said to Peter:  Put up thy sword into the scabbard.  The
chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.12">Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the Jews, took Jesus,
and bound him:

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.13">And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father in law to
Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.14">Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews:  That it was
expedient that one man should die for the people.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple.  And that
disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the
court of the high priest.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.16">But Peter stood at the door without.  The other disciple therefore, who
was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and
brought in Peter.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.17">The maid therefore that was portress, saith to Peter:  Art not thou also
one of this man's disciples?  He saith:  I am not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.18">Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was
cold, and warmed themselves.  And with them was Peter also, standing,
and warming himself.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.19">The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
doctrine.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.20">Jesus answered him:  I have spoken openly to the world:  I have always
taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort;
and in secret I have spoken nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.21">Why asketh thou me?  ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto
them:  behold they know what things I have said.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.22">And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by, gave
Jesus a blow, saying:  Answerest thou the high priest so?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.23">Jesus answered him:  If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but
if well, why strikest thou me?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.24">And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.25">And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself.  They said
therefore to him:  Art not thou also one of his disciples?  He denied it,
and said:  I am not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.26">One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him whose ear Peter
cut off) saith to him:  Did I not see thee in the garden with him?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.27">Again therefore Peter denied; and immediately the cock crew.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.28">Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor's hall.  And it was
morning; and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled,
but that they might eat the pasch.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.29">Pilate therefore went out to them, and said:  What accusation bring you
against this man?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.30">They answered, and said to him:  If he were not a malefactor, we would
not have delivered him up to thee.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.31">Pilate therefore said to them:  Take him you, and judge him according to
your law.  The Jews therefore said to him:  It is not lawful for us to put
any man to death;

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.32">That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying what
death he should die.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.33">Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called Jesus, and said to
him:  Art thou the king of the Jews?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.34">Jesus answered:  Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it
thee of me?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.35">Pilate answered:  Am I a Jew?  Thy own nation, and the chief priests,
have delivered thee up to me:  what hast thou done?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.36">Jesus answered:  My kingdom is not of this world.  If my kingdom were of
this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be
delivered to the Jews:  but now my kingdom is not from hence.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.37">Pilate therefore said to him:  Art thou a king then?  Jesus answered:  Thou
sayest that I am a king.  For this was I born, and for this came I into the
world; that I should give testimony to the truth.  Every one that is of the
truth, heareth my voice.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.38">Pilate saith to him:  What is truth?  And when he said this, he went out
again to the Jews, and saith to them:  I find no cause in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.39">But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the pasch:
will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?

</p>
               <p n="N4.18.40">Then cried they all again, saying:  Not this man, but Barabbas.  Now
Barabbas was a robber.

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="n4.19" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter 19</head>
               <p n="N4.19.1">Then therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.2">And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head; and
they put on him a purple garment.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.3">And they came to him, and said:  Hail, king of the Jews; and they gave
him blows.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.4">Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them:  Behold, I bring him
forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.5">(Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple
garment.) And he saith to them:  Behold the Man.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.6">When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they
cried out, saying:  Crucify him, crucify him.  Pilate saith to them:  Take
him you, and crucify him:  for I find no cause in him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.7">The Jews answered him:  We have a law; and according to the law he
ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.8">When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.9">And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus:  Whence art
thou?  But Jesus gave him no answer.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.10">Pilate therefore saith to him:  Speakest thou not to me?  knowest thou not
that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.11">Jesus answered:  Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it
were given thee from above.  Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee,
hath the greater sin.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.12">And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him.  But the Jews cried out,
saying:  If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend.  For
whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.13">Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat
down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and
in Hebrew Gabbatha.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.14">And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith
to the Jews:  Behold your king.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.15">But they cried out:  Away with him; away with him; crucify him.  Pilate
saith to them:  Shall I crucify your king?  The chief priests answered:  We
have no king but Caesar.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.16">Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified.  And they took
Jesus, and led him forth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.17">And bearing his own cross, he went forth to that place which is called
Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.18">Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and
Jesus in the midst.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.19">And Pilate wrote a title also, and he put it upon the cross.  And the
writing was:  JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.20">This title therefore many of the Jews did read:  because the place where
Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city:  and it was written in Hebrew, in
Greek, and in Latin.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.21">Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate:  Write not, The King of
the Jews; but that he said, I am the King of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.22">Pilate answered:  What I have written, I have written.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments,
(and they made four parts, to every soldier a part,) and also his coat.
Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.24">They said then one to another:  Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for
it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, saying:  They
have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have cast
lot.  And the soldiers indeed did these things.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.25">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's
sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.26">When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing
whom he loved, he saith to his mother:  Woman, behold thy son.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.27">After that, he saith to the disciple:  Behold thy mother.  And from that
hour, the disciple took her to his own.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.28">Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that
the scripture might be fulfilled, said:  I thirst.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.29">Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar.  And they, putting a
sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put it to his mouth.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.30">Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said:  It is consummated.
And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.31">Then the Jews, (because it was the parasceve,) that the bodies might not
remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that was a great sabbath
day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might
be taken away.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.32">The soldiers therefore came; and they broke the legs of the first, and of
the other that was crucified with him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.33">But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that he was already
dead, they did not break his legs.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.34">But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side, and immediately
there came out blood and water.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.35">And he that saw it, hath given testimony, and his testimony is true.  And
he knoweth that he saith true; that you also may believe.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.36">For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled:  You
shall not break a bone of him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.37">And again another scripture saith:  They shall look on him whom they
pierced.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.38">And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (because he was a disciple
of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might
take away the body of Jesus.  And Pilate gave leave.  He came therefore,
and took the body of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.39">And Nicodemus also came, (he who at the first came to Jesus by night,)
bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.40">They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with
the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.41">Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and in the
garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid.

</p>
               <p n="N4.19.42">There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus,
because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

               <p n="N4.20.1">And on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, when it
was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the stone taken away
from the sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.2">She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple
whom Jesus loved, and saith to them:  They have taken away the Lord
out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.3">Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and they came to the
sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.4">And they both ran together, and that other disciple did outrun Peter, and
came first to the sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.5">And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying; but yet he
went not in.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.6">Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre,
and saw the linen cloths lying,

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.7">And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen
cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.8">Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre:
and he saw, and believed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.9">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the
dead.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.10">The disciples therefore departed again to their home.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.11">But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping.  Now as she was
weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.12">And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the
feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.13">They say to her:  Woman, why weepest thou?  She saith to them:  Because
they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid
him.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.14">When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus
standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.15">Jesus saith to her:  Woman, why weepest thou?  whom seekest thou?  She,
thinking it was the gardener, saith to him:  Sir, if thou hast taken him
hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.16">Jesus saith to her:  Mary.  She turning, saith to him:  Rabboni (which is to
say, Master).

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.17">Jesus saith to her:  Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my
Father.  But go to my brethren, and say to them:  I ascend to my Father
and to your Father, to my God and your God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.18">Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples:  I have seen the Lord,
and these things he said to me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.19">Now when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the doors
were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the
Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them:  Peace be to
you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.20">And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his side.  The
disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.21">He said therefore to them again:  Peace be to you.  As the Father hath
sent me, I also send you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.22">When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them:
Receive ye the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.23">Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you
shall retain, they are retained.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.24">Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with
them when Jesus came.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.25">The other disciples therefore said to him:  We have seen the Lord.  But he
said to them:  Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and
put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side,
I will not believe.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with
them.  Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and
said:  Peace be to you.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.27">Then he saith to Thomas:  Put in thy finger hither, and see my hands; and
bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but
believing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.28">Thomas answered, and said to him:  My Lord, and my God.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.29">Jesus saith to him:  Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast
believed:  blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.30">Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his disciples, which are
not written in this book.

</p>
               <p n="N4.20.31">But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God:  and that believing, you may have life in his name.

               <p n="N4.21.1">After this, Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of
Tiberias.  And he shewed himself after this manner.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.2">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas, who is called Didymus,
and Nathanael, who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee,
and two others of his disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.3">Simon Peter saith to them:  I go a fishing.  They say to him:  We also come
with thee.  And they went forth, and entered into the ship:  and that night
they caught nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.4">But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore:  yet the
disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.5">Jesus therefore said to them:  Children, have you any meat?  They
answered him:  No.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.6">He saith to them:  Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you
shall find.  They cast therefore; and now they were not able to draw it,
for the multitude of fishes.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.7">That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved, said to Peter:  It is the Lord.
Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat about him,
(for he was naked,) and cast himself into the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.8">But the other disciples came in the ship, (for they were not far from the
land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.9">As soon then as they came to land, they saw hot coals lying, and a fish
laid thereon, and bread.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.10">Jesus saith to them:  Bring hither of the fishes which you have now
caught.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one
hundred and fifty-three.  And although there were so many, the net was
not broken.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.12">Jesus saith to them:  Come, and dine.  And none of them who were at
meat, durst ask him:  Who art thou?  knowing that it was the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.13">And Jesus cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish in like
manner.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.14">This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples,
after he was risen from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.15">When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter:  Simon son of
John, lovest thou me more than these?  He saith to him:  Yea, Lord, thou
knowest that I love thee.  He saith to him:  Feed my lambs.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.16">He saith to him again:  Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?  He saith to
him:  Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.  He saith to him:  Feed my lambs.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.17">He said to him the third time:  Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?  Peter
was grieved, because he had said to him the third time:  Lovest thou me?
And he said to him:  Lord, thou knowest all things:  thou knowest that I
love thee.  He said to him:  Feed my sheep.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.18">Amen, amen I say to thee, when thou wast younger, thou didst gird
thyself, and didst walk where thou wouldst.  But when thou shalt be old,
thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead
thee whither thou wouldst not.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.19">And this he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God.  And
when he had said this, he saith to him:  Follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.20">Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following, who
also leaned on his breast at supper, and said:  Lord, who is he that shall
betray thee?

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.21">Him therefore when Peter had seen, he saith to Jesus:  Lord, and what
shall this man do?

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.22">Jesus saith to him:  So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it
to thee?  follow thou me.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.23">This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple
should not die.  And Jesus did not say to him:  He should not die; but, So I
will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee?

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.24">This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things, and hath
written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.

</p>
               <p n="N4.21.25">But there are also many other things which Jesus did; which, if they were
written every one, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain
the books that should be written.

               <p n="N5.1.1">The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began
to do and to teach,

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.2">Until the day on which, giving commandments by the Holy Ghost to the
apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.3">To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion, by many proofs,
for forty days appearing to them, and speaking of the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.4">And eating together with them, he commanded them, that they should not
depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for the promise of the Father,
which you have heard (saith he) by my mouth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.5">For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the
Holy Ghost, not many days hence.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.6">They therefore who were come together, asked him, saying:  Lord, wilt
thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.7">But he said to them:  It is not for you to know the times or moments,
which the Father hath put in his own power:

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.8">But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and
you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria,
and even to the uttermost part of the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.9">And when he had said these things, while they looked on, he was raised
up:  and a cloud received him out of their sight.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.10">And while they were beholding him going up to heaven, behold two men
stood by them in white garments.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.11">Who also said:  Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven?
This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have
seen him going into heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.12">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called Olivet,
which is nigh Jerusalem, within a sabbath day's journey.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.13">And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode
Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and
Matthew, James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of
James.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.14">All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women, and
Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.15">In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the brethren, said:  (now
the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty:)

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.16">Men, brethren, the scripture must needs be fulfilled, which the Holy
Ghost spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the leader
of them that apprehended Jesus:

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.17">Who was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.18">And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of iniquity, and
being hanged, burst asunder in the midst:  and all his bowels gushed out.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.19">And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:  so that the
same field was called in their tongue, Haceldama, that is to say, The field
of blood.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.20">For it is written in the book of Psalms:  Let their habitation become
desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein.  And his bishopric let
another take.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.21">Wherefore of these men who have companied with us all the time that the
Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.22">Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken
up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.23">And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed
Justus, and Matthias.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.24">And praying, they said:  Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men,
shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.25">To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas
hath by transgression fallen, that he might go to his own place.

</p>
               <p n="N5.1.26">And they gave them lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was
numbered with the eleven apostles.

               <head>Chapter 2</head>
               <p n="N5.2.1">And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all
together in one place:

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.2">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming,
and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.3">And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat
upon every one of them:

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.4">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak
with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.5">Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every
nation under heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.6">And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were
confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own
tongue.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.7">And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying:  Behold, are not all
these, that speak, Galileans?

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.8">And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia,
Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.10">Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and
strangers of Rome,

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.11">Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians:  we have heard them
speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.12">And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another:  What
meaneth this?

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.13">But others mocking, said:  These men are full of new wine.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.14">But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to
them:  Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this
known to you, and with your ears receive my words.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.15">For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour
of the day:

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.16">But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.17">And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord,) I will
pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh:  and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.18">And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in
those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.19">And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth
beneath:  blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before
the great and manifest day of the Lord come.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.21">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of
the Lord, shall be saved.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.22">Ye men of Israel, hear these words:  Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of
God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by
him, in the midst of you, as you also know:

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.23">This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.24">Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was
impossible that he should be holden by it.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.25">For David saith concerning him:  I foresaw the Lord before my face:
because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.26">For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath rejoiced:  moreover
my flesh also shall rest in hope.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.27">Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to
see corruption.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.28">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life:  thou shalt make me full of
joy with thy countenance.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.29">Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David;
that he died, and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this present
day.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.30">Whereas therefore he was a prophet, and knew that God hath sworn to him
with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.31">Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ.  For neither was
he left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.32">This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.33">Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God, and having received of
the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this
which you see and hear.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.34">For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said:  The Lord said
to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.35">Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly, that God hath
made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.37">Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their
heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles:  What shall we do,
men and brethren?

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.38">But Peter said to them:  Do penance, and be baptized every one of you in
the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins:  and you shall
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.39">For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are far
off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.40">And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying:
Save yourselves from this perverse generation.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.41">They therefore that received his word, were baptized; and there were
added in that day about three thousand souls.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.42">And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles, and in the
communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.43">And fear came upon every soul:  many wonders also and signs were done by
the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was great fear in all.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.44">And all they that believed, were together, and had all things common.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.45">Their possessions and goods they sold, and divided them to all,
according as every one had need.

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.46">And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread
from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of
heart;

</p>
               <p n="N5.2.47">Praising God, and having favour with all the people.  And the Lord
increased daily together such as should be saved.

               <p n="N5.3.1">Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.2">And a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb, was carried:  whom
they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called
Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.3">He, when he had seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked
to receive an alms.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.4">But Peter with John fastening his eyes upon him, said:  Look upon us.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.5">But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he should receive
something of them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.6">But Peter said:  Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give
thee:  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise, and walk.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.7">And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up, and forthwith his
feet and soles received strength.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.8">And he leaping up, stood, and walked, and went in with them into the
temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.9">And all the people saw him walking and praising God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.10">And they knew him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beartiful
gate of the temple:  and they were filled with wonder and amazement at
that which had happened to him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.11">And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran to them to the porch
which is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.12">But Peter seeing, made answer to the people:  Ye men of Israel, why
wonder you at this?  or why look you upon us, as if by our strength or power we
had made this man to walk?

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.13">The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God
of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up
and denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged he should be released.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.14">But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be
granted unto you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.15">But the author of life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead,
of which we are witnesses.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.16">And in the faith of his name, this man, whom you have seen and known,
hath his name strengthened; and the faith which is by him, hath given this
perfect soundness in the sight of you all.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.17">And now, brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance, as did also
your rulers.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.18">But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all the
prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.19">Be penitent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
out.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.20">That when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence of the
Lord, and he shall send him who hath been preached unto you, Jesus Christ,

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.21">Whom heaven indeed must receive, until the times of the restitution of
all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets, from
the beginning of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.22">For Moses said:  A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of
your brethren, like unto me:  him you shall hear according to all things
whatsoever he shall speak to you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.23">And it shall be, that every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall
be destroyed from among the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.24">And all the prophets, from Samuel and afterwards, who have spoken, have
told of these days.

</p>
               <p n="N5.3.25">You are the children of the prophets, and of the testament which God
made to our fathers, saying to Abraham:  And in thy seed shall all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed.

</p>

</p>

               <p n="N5.4.6">And Annas the high priest, and Caiphas, and John, and Alexander, and as
many as were of the kindred of the high priest.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.7">And setting them in the midst, they asked:  By what power, or by what
name, have you done this?

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them:  Ye princes of the
people, and ancients, hear:

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.9">If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the infirm
man, by what means he hath been made whole:

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.10">Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God hath
raised from the dead, even by him this man standeth here before you whole.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.11">This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders, which is
become the head of the corner.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.12">Neither is there salvation in any other.  For there is no other name
under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.13">Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they
were illiterate and ignorant men, they wondered; and they knew them that they
had been with Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.14">Seeing the man also who had been healed standing with them, they could
say nothing against it.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.15">But they commanded them to go aside out of the council; and they
conferred among themselves,

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.16">Saying:  What shall we do to these men?  for indeed a known miracle hath
been done by them, to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:  it is manifest, and
we cannot deny it.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.17">But that it may be no farther spread among the people, let us threaten
them that they speak no more in this name to any man.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.18">And calling them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor teach in
the name of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.19">But Peter and John answering, said to them:  If it be just in the sight
of God, to hear you rather than God, judge ye.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.20">For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.21">But they threatening, sent them away, not finding how they might punish
them, because of the people; for all men glorified what had been done,
in that which had come to pass.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.22">For the man was above forty years old, in whom that miraculous cure had
been wrought.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.23">And being let go, they came to their own company, and related all that
the chief priests and ancients had said to them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.24">Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their voice to God, and
said:  Lord, thou art he that didst make heaven and earth, the sea, and
all things that are in them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.25">Who, by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David, thy servant,
hast said:  Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people meditate vain things?

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.26">The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes assembled together
against the Lord and his Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.27">For of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy holy
child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the
Gentiles and the people of Israel,

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.28">To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.29">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants,
that with all confidence they may speak thy word,

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.30">By stretching forth thy hand to cures, and signs, and wonders to be done
by the name of thy holy Son Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.31">And when they had prayed, the place was moved wherein they were
assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the
word of God with confidence.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.32">And the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul:  neither
did any one say that aught of the things which he possessed, was his own;
but all things were common unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.33">And with great power did the apostles give testimony of the resurrection
of Jesus Christ our Lord; and great grace was in them all.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.34">For neither was there any one needy among them.  For as many as were
owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things they
sold,

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.35">And laid it down before the feet of the apostles.  And distribution was
made to every one, according as he had need.

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.36">And Joseph, who, by the apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, by
interpretation, The son of consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian born,

</p>
               <p n="N5.4.37">Having land, sold it, and brought the price, and laid it at the feet of
the apostles.

               <head>Chapter 5</head>
               <p n="N5.5.1">But a certain man named Ananias, with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of
land,

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.2">And by fraud kept back part of the price of the land, his wife being
privy thereunto:  and bringing a certain part of it, laid it at the feet of the
apostles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.3">But Peter said:  Ananias, why hath Satan tempted thy heart, that thou
shouldst lie to the Holy Ghost, and by fraud keep part of the price of
the land?

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.4">Whilst it remained, did it not remain to thee?  and after it was sold,
was it not in thy power?  Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart?
Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.5">And Ananias hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost.  And
there came great fear upon all that heard it.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.6">And the young men rising up, removed him, and carrying him out, buried
him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.7">And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not
knowing what had happened, came in.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.8">And Peter said to her:  Tell me, woman, whether you sold the land for so
much?  And she said:  Yea, for so much.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.9">And Peter said unto her:  Why have you agreed together to tempt the
Spirit of the Lord?  Behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband are at
the door, and they shall carry thee out.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.10">Immediately she fell down before his feet, and gave up the ghost.  And
the young men coming in, found her dead:  and carried her out, and buried her
by her husband.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.11">And there came great fear upon the whole church, and upon all that heard
these things.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.12">And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
among the people.  And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.13">But of the rest no man durst join himself unto them; but the people
magnified them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.14">And the multitude of men and women who believed in the Lord, was more
increased:

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.15">Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid
them on beds and couches, that when Peter came, his shadow at the least,
might overshadow any of them, and they might be delivered from their
infirmities.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.16">And there came also together to Jerusalem a multitude out of the
neighboring cities, bringing sick persons, and such as were troubled
with unclean spirits; who were all healed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.17">Then the high prist rising up, and all they that were with him, (which
is the heresy of the Sadducees,) were filled with envy.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.18">And they laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.19">But an angel of the Lord by night opening the doors of the prison, and
leading them out, said:

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.20">Go, and standing speak in the temple to the people all the words of this
life.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.21">Who having heard this, early in the morning, entered into the temple,
and taught.  And the high priest coming, and they that were with him, called
together the council, and all the ancients of the children of Israel;
and they sent to the prison to have them brought.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.22">But when the ministers came, and opening the prison, found them not
there, they returned and told,

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.23">Saying:  The prison indeed we found shut with all diligence, and the
keepers standing before the doors; but opening it, we found no man within.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.24">Now when the officer of the temple and the chief priests heard these
words, they were in doubt concerning them, what would come to pass.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.25">But one came and told them:  Behold, the men whom you put in prison are
in the temple standing, and teaching the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.26">Then went the officer with the ministers, and brought them without
violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.27">And when they had brought them, they set them before the council.  And
the high priest asked them,

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.28">Saying:  Commanding we commanded you, that you should not teach in this
name; and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and you
have a mind to bring the blood of this man upon us.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.29">But Peter and the apostles answering, said:  We ought to obey God, rather
than men.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.30">The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom you put to death,
hanging him upon a tree.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.31">Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be Prince and Saviour, to
give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.32">And we are witnesses of these things and the Holy Ghost, whom God hath
given to all that obey him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.33">When they had heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they
thought to put them to death.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.34">But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor
of the law, respected by all the people, commanded the men to be put forth
a little while.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.35">And he said to them:  Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you
intend to do, as touching these men.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.36">For before these days rose up Theodas, affirming himself to be somebody,
to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves:  who was
slain; and all that believed him were scattered, and brought to nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.37">After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the enrolling,
and drew away the people after him:  he also perished; and all, even as many
as consented to him, were dispersed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.38">And now, therefore, I say to you, refrain from these men, and let them
alone; for if this council or this work be of men, it will come to nought;

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.39">But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found
even to fight against God.  And they consented to him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.40">And calling in the apostles, after they had scourged them, they charged
them that they should not speak at all in the name of Jesus; and they
dismissed them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.41">And they indeed went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that
they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.5.42">And every day they ceased not in the temple, and from house to house, to
teach and preach Christ Jesus.

               <p n="N5.6.1">And in those days, the number of the disciples increasing, there arose a
murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, for that their widows were
neglected in the daily ministration.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.2">Then the twelve calling together the multitude of the disciples, said:
It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.3">Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of good reputation,
full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.4">But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of
the word.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.5">And the saying was liked by all the multitude.  And they chose Stephen, a
man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and
Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.6">These they set before the apostles; and they praying, imposed hands upon
them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.7">And the word of the Lord increased; and the number of the disciples was
multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly:  a great multitude also of the priests
obeyed the faith.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.8">And Stephen, full of grace and fortitude, did great wonders and signs
among the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.9">Now there arose some of that which is called the synagogue of the
Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them
that were of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.10">And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit that spoke.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.11">Then they suborned men to say, they had heard him speak words of
blasphemy against Moses and against God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.12">And they stirred up the people, and the ancients, and the scribes; and
running together, they took him, and brought him to the council.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.13">And they set up false witnesses, who said:  This man ceaseth not to speak
words against the holy place and the law.

</p>
               <p n="N5.6.14">For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
this place, and shall change the traditions which Moses delivered unto us.

</p>

had been the face of an angel.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.2">Who said:  Ye men, brethren, and fathers, hear.  The God of glory appeared
to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in
Charan.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.3">And said to him:  Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and
come into the land which I shall shew thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.4">Then he went out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charan.  And
from thence, after his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein
you now dwell.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.5">And he gave him no inheritance in it; no, not the pace of a foot:  but he
promised to give it him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as
yet he had no child.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.6">And God said to him:  That his seed should sojourn in a strange country,
and that they should bring them under bondage, and treat them evil four
hundred years.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.7">And the nation which they shall serve will I judge, said the Lord; and
after these things they shall go out, and shall serve me in this place.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.8">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he begot Isaac, and
circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob the twelve
patriarchs.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.9">And the patriarchs, through envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; and God was
with him,

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.10">And delivered him out of all his tribulations:  and he gave him favour
and wisdom in the sight of Pharao, the king of Egypt; and he appointed him
governor over Egypt, and over all his house.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.11">Now there came a famine upon all Egypt and Chanaan, and great
tribulation; and our fathers found no food.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.12">But when Jacob had heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent our
fathers first:

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.13">And at the second time, Joseph was known by his brethren, and his
kindred was made known to Pharao.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.14">And Joseph sending, called thither Jacob, his father, and all his
kindred, seventy-five souls.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.15">So Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, and our fathers.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.16">And they were translated into Sichem, and were laid in the sepulchre,
that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hemor, the son of
Sichem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.17">And when the time of the promise drew near, which God had promised to
Abraham, the people increased, and were multiplied in Egypt,

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.18">Till another king arose in Egypt, who knew not Joseph.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.19">This same dealing craftily with our race, afflicted our fathers, that
they should expose their children, to the end they might not be kept alive.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.20">At the same time was Moses born, and he was acceptable to God:  who was
nourished three months in his father's house.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.21">And when he was exposed, Pharao's daughter took him up, and nourished
him for her own son.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.22">And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was
mighty in his words and in his deeds.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.23">And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit
his brethren, the children of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.24">And when he had seen one of them suffer wrong, he defended him; and
striking the Egyptian, he avenged him who suffered the injury.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.25">And he thought that his brethren understood that God by his hand would
save them; but they understood it not.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.26">And the day following, he shewed himself to them when they were at
strife; and would have reconciled them in peace, saying:  Men, ye are brethren;
why hurt you one another?

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.27">But he that did the injury to his neighbour thrust him away, saying:  Who
hath appointed thee prince and judge over us?

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.28">What, wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian?

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.29">And Moses fled upon this word, and was a stranger in the land of Madian,
where he begot two sons.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.30">And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the desert
of mount Sina, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.31">And Moses seeing it, wondered at the sight.  And as he drew near to view
it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.32">I am the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.  And Moses being terrified, durst not behold.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.33">And the Lord said to him:  Loose the shoes from thy feet, for the place
wherein thou standest, is holy ground.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.34">Seeing I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I
have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them.  And now
come, and I will send thee into Egypt.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.35">This Moses, whom they refused, saying:  Who hath appointed thee prince
and judge?  him God sent to be prince and redeemer by the hand of the angel
who appeared to him in the bush.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.36">He brought them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and
in the Red Sea, and in the desert forty years.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.37">This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel:  A prophet shall
God raise up to you of your own brethren, as myself:  him shall you hear.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.38">This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel who
spoke to him on mount Sina, and with our fathers; who received the words
of life to give unto us.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.39">Whom our fathers would not obey; but thrust him away, and in their
hearts turned back into Egypt,

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.40">Saying to Aaron:  Make us gods to go before us.  For as for this Moses,
who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.41">And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifices to the idol,
and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.42">And God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven, as it is
written in the books of the prophets:  Did you offer victims and sacrifices to
me for forty years, in the desert, O house of Israel?

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.43">And you took unto you the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god
Rempham, figures which you made to adore them.  And I will carry you away
beyond Babylon.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.44">The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the desert, as
God ordained for them, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according
to the form which he had seen.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.45">Which also our fathers receiving, brought in with Jesus, into the
possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our
fathers, unto the days of David.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.46">Who found grace before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God
of Jacob.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.47">But Solomon built him a house.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.48">Yet the most High dwelleth not in houses made by hands, as the prophet
saith:

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.49">Heaven is my throne, and the earth my footstool.  What house will you
build me?  saith the Lord; or what is the place of my resting?

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.50">Hath not my hand made all these things?

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.51">You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist
the Holy Ghost:  as your fathers did, so do you also.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.52">Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?  And they have
slain them who foretold of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been
now the betrayers and murderers:

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.53">Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not
kept it.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.54">Now hearing these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed
with their teeth at him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.55">But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looking up steadfastly to heaven,
saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God.  And he
said:   Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the
right hand of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.56">And they crying out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and with one
accord ran violently upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.57">And casting him forth without the city, they stoned him; and the
witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, whose name was
Saul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.58">And they stoned Stephen, invoking, and saying:  Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit.

</p>
               <p n="N5.7.59">And falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, saying:  Lord, lay
not this sin to their charge.  And when he had said this, he fell asleep in
the Lord.  And Saul was consenting to his death.

               <head>Chapter 8</head>
               <p n="N5.8.1">And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church
which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the
countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.2">And devout men took order for Stephen's funeral, and made great mourning
over him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.3">But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house, and
dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.4">They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of
God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.5">And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.6">And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were
said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.7">For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went
out.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.8">And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.9">There was therefore great joy in that city.  Now there was a certain man
named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the
people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.10">To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying:  This
man is the power of God, which is called great.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.11">And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had
bewitched them with his magical practices.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.12">But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in
the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.13">Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to
Philip.  And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great
miracles which were done.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.14">Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had
received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.15">Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the
Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.16">For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized
in the name of the Lord Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.17">Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.18">And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles,
the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.19">Saying:  Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my
hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.  But Peter said to him:

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.20">Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast
thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.21">Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter.  For thy heart is not right in
the sight of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.22">Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that
perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.23">For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of
iniquity.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.24">Then Simon answering, said:  Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of
these things which you have spoken may come upon me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.25">And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord,
returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the
Samaritans.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.26">Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying:  Arise, go towards the
south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza:  this is desert.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.27">And rising up, he went.  And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of
great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over
all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.28">And he was returning, sitting in this chariot, and reading Isaias the
prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.29">And the Spirit said to Philip:  Go near, and join thyself to this
chariot.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.30">And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias.  And he
said:  Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.31">Who said:  And how can I, unless some man shew me?  And he desired Philip
that he would come up and sit with him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.32">And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this:  He was led
as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his
shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.33">In humility his judgment was taken away.  His generation who shall
declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.34">And the eunuch answering Philip, said:  I beseech thee, of whom doth the
prophet speak this?  of himself, or of some other man?

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.35">Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture,
preached unto him Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.36">And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the
eunuch said:  See, here is water:  what doth hinder me from being baptized?

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.37">And Philip said:  If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest.  And
he answering, said:  I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the
water, both Philip and the eunuch:  and he baptized him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.39">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took
away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more.  And he went on his way
rejoicing.

</p>
               <p n="N5.8.40">But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the
gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

               <head>Chapter 9</head>
               <p n="N5.9.1">And Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.2">And asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues:  that if he
found any men and wemen of this way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.3">And as he went on his journey, it came to pass that he drew nigh to
Damascus; and suddenly a light from heaven shined round about him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.4">And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him:  Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me?

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.5">Who said:  Who art thou, Lord?  And he:  I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.6">And he trembling and astonished, said:  Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do?

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.7">And the Lord said to him:  Arise, and go into the city, and there it
shall be told thee what thou must do.  Now the men who went in company with
him, stood amazed, hearing indeed a voice, but seeing no man.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.8">And Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he saw
nothing.  But they leading him by the hands, brought him to Damascus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.9">And he was there three days, without sight, and he did neither eat nor
drink.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.10">Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias.  And the
Lord said to him in a vision:  Ananias.  And he said:  Behold I am here, Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.11">And the Lord said to him:  Arise, and go into the street that is called
Stait, and seek in the house of Judas, one named Saul of Tarsus.  For
behold he prayeth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.12">(And he saw a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hands upon
him, that he might receive his sight.)

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.13">But Ananias answered:  Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much
evil he hath done to thy saints in Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.14">And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that
invoke thy name.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.15">And the Lord said to him:  Go thy way; for this man is to me a vessel of
election, to carry my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children
of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.16">For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.17">And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house.  And laying his
hands upon him, he said:  Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus hath sent me, he that
appeared to thee in the way as thou camest; that thou mayest receive thy
sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.18">And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he
received his sight; and rising up, he was baptized.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.19">And when he had taken meat, he was strengthened.  And he was with the
disciples that were at Damascus, for some days.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.20">And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son
of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.21">And all that heard him, were astonished, and said:  Is not this he who
persecuted in Jerusalem those that called upon this name:  and came
hither for that intent, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.22">But Saul increased much more in strength, and confounded the Jews who
dwelt at Damascus, affirming that this is the Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.23">And when many days were passed, the Jews consulted together to kill him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.24">But their laying in wait was made known to Saul.  And they watched the
gates also day and night, that they might kill him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.25">But the disciples taking him in the night, conveyed him away by the
wall, letting him down in a basket.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.26">And when he was come into Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the
disciples; and they all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a
disciple.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.27">But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and told them
how he had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken to him; and how in Damascus
he had dealt confidently in the name of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.28">And he was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem, and dealing
confidently in the name of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.29">He spoke also to the Gentiles, and disputed with the Greeks; but they
sought to kill him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.30">Which when the brethren had known, they brought him down to Caesarea,
and sent him away to Tarsus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.31">Now the church had peace throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria;
and was edified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and was filled with the
consolation of the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.32">And it came to pass that Peter, as he passed through, visiting all, came
to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.33">And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed for
eight years, who was ill of the palsy.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.34">And Peter said to him:  Eneas, the Lord Jesus Christ healeth thee:  arise,
and make thy bed.  And immediately he arose.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.35">And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron, saw him:  who were converted to
the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.36">And in Joppe there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
interpretation is called Dorcas.  This woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds which she did.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.37">And it came to pass in those days that she was sick, and died.  Whom when
they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.38">And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppe, the disciples hearing that
Peter was there, sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not be
slack to come unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.39">And Peter rising up, went with them.  And when he was come, they brought
him into the upper chamber.  And all the widows stood about him weeping, and
shewing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.40">And they all being put forth, Peter kneeling down prayed, and turning to
the body, he said:  Tabitha, arise.  And she opened her eyes; and seeing
Peter, she sat up.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.41">And giving her his hand, he lifted her up.  And when he had called the
saints and the widows, he presented her alive.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.42">And it was made known throughout all Joppe; and many believed in the
Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.9.43">And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppe, with one Simon a
tanner.

               <p n="N5.10.1">And there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of
that which is called the Italian band;

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.2">A religious man, and fearing God with all his house, giving much alms to
the people, and always praying to God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.3">This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an
angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him:  Cornelius.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.4">And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said:  What is it, Lord?
And he said to him:  Thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a memorial in
the sight of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.5">And now send men to Joppe, and call hither one Simon, who is surnamed
Peter:

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.6">He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.  He
will tell thee what thou must do.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.7">And when the angel who spoke to him was departed, he called two of his
household servants, and a soldier who feared the Lord, of them that were
under him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.8">To whom when he had related all, he sent them to Joppe.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.9">And on the next day, whilst they were going on their journey, and
drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to
pray, about the sixth hour.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.10">And being hungry, he was desirous to taste somewhat.  And as they were
preparing, there came upon him an ecstasy of mind.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.11">And he saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it
were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to the earth:

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.12">Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts, and creeping things of the
earth, and fowls of the air.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.13">And there came a voice to him:  Arise, Peter; kill and eat.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.14">But Peter said:  Far be it from me; for I never did eat any thing that is
common and unclean.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.15">And the voice spoke to him again the second time:  That which God hath
cleansed, do not thou call common.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.16">And this was done thrice; and presently the vessel was taken up into
heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.17">Now, whilst Peter was doubting within himself, what the vision that he
had seen should mean, behold the men who were sent from Cornelius, inquiring
for Simon's house, stood at the gate.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.18">And when they had called, they asked, if Simon, who is surnamed Peter,
were lodged there.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.19">And as Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him:  Behold
three men seek thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.20">Arise, therefore, get thee down and go with them, doubting nothing:  for
I have sent them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.21">Then Peter, going down to the men, said:  Behold, I am he whom you seek;
what is the cause for which you are come?

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.22">Who said:  Cornelius, a centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God,
and having good testimony from all the nation of the Jews, received an
answer of an holy angel, to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of
thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.23">Then bringing them in, he lodged them.  And the day following he arose,
and went with them:  and some of the brethren from Joppe accompanied him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.24">And the morrow after, he entered into Caesarea.  And Cornelius waited for
them, having called together his kinsmen and special friends.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.25">And it came to pass, that when Peter was come in, Cornelius came to meet
him, Cornelius came to meet him, and falling at his feet adored.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.26">But Peter lifted him up, saying:  Arise, I myself also am a man.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.27">And talking with him, he went in, and found many that were come
together.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.28">And he said to them:  You know how abominable it is for a man that is a
Jew, to keep company or to come unto one of another nation:  but God hath
shewed to me, to call no man common or unclean.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.29">For which cause, making no doubt, I came when I was sent for.  I ask,
therefore, for what cause you have sent for me?

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.30">And Cornelius said:  Four days ago, unto this hour, I was praying in my
house, at the ninth hour, and behold a man stood before me in white apparel,
and said:

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.31">Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are had in remembrance in
the sight of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.32">Send therefore to Joppe, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter:
he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.33">Immediately therefore I sent to thee:  and thou hast done well in coming.
Now therefore all we are present in thy sight, to hear all things whatsoever
are commanded thee by the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.34">And Peter opening his mouth, said:  In very deed I perceive, that God is
not a respecter of persons.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.35">But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh justice, is
acceptable to him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.36">God sent the word to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus
Christ:  (he is Lord of all.)

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.37">You know the word which hath been published through all Judea:  for it
began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached,

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.38">Jesus of Nazareth:  how God anointed him with the Holy Ghost, and with
power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by
the devil, for God was with him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.39">And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the Jews
and in Jerusalem, whom they killed, hanging him upon a tree.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.40">Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.41">Not to all the people, but to witnesses preordained by God, even to us,
who did eat and drink with him after he arose again from the dead;

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.42">And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is
he who was appointed by God, to be judge of the living and of the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.43">To him all the prophets give testimony, that by his name all receive
remission of sins, who believe in him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.44">While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
them that heard the word.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.45">And the faithful of the circumcision, who came with Peter, were
astonished, for that the grace of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the
Gentiles also.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.46">For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.47">Then Peter answered:  Can any man forbid water, that these should not be
baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, as well as we?

</p>
               <p n="N5.10.48">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ.  Then they desired him to tarry with them some days.

               <head>Chapter 11</head>
               <p n="N5.11.1">And the apostles and brethren, who were in Judea, heard that the
Gentiles also had received the word of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.2">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
circumcision contended with him,

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.3">Saying:  Why didst thou go in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with
them?

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.4">But Peter began and declared to them the matter in order, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.5">I was in the city of Joppe praying, and I saw in an ecstasy of mind a
vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from
heaven by four corners, and it came even unto me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.6">Into which looking, I considered, and saw fourfooted creatures of the
earth, and beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air:

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.7">And I heard also a voice saying to me:  Arise, Peter; kill and eat.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.8">And I said:  Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean hath ever
entered into my mouth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.9">And the voice answered again from heaven:  What God hath made clean, do
not thou call common.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.10">And this was done three times:  and all were taken up again into heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.11">And behold, immediately there were three men come to the house wherein I
was, sent to me from Caesarea.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.12">And the Spirit said to me, that I should go with them, nothing doubting.
And these six brethren went with me also:  and we entered into the man's
house.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.13">And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing, and
saying to him:  Send to Joppe, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter,

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.14">Who shall speak to thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, and all thy
house.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.15">And when I had begun to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon them, as upon us
also in the beginning.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said:  John indeed
baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.17">If then God gave them the same grace, as to us also who believed in the
Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, that could withstand God?

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.18">Having heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God,
saying:  God then hath also to the Gentiles given repentance unto life.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.19">Now they who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose on
occasion of Stephen, went about as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch,
speaking the word to none, but to the Jews only.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.20">But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were
entered into Antioch, spoke also to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.21">And the hand of the Lord was with them:  and a great number believing,
were converted to the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.22">And the tidings came to the ears of the church that was at Jerusalem,
touching these things:  and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.23">Who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, rejoiced:  and he
exhorted them all with purpose of heart to continue in the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.24">For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith.  And a
great multitude was added to the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.25">And Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul:  whom, when he had found, he
brought to Antioch.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.26">And they conversed there in the church a whole year; and they taught a
great multitude, so that at Antioch the disciples were first named Christians.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.27">And in these days there came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch:

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.28">And one of them named Agabus, rising up, signified by the Spirit, that
there should be a great famine over the whole world, which came to pass
under Claudius.

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.29">And the disciples, every man according to his ability, purposed to send
relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea:

</p>
               <p n="N5.11.30">Which also they did, sending it to the ancients, by the hands of
Barnabas and Saul.

               <head>Chapter 12</head>
               <p n="N5.12.1">And at the same time, Herod the king stretched forth his hands, to
afflict some of the church.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.2">And he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.3">And seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to take up Peter also.
Now it was in the days of the Azymes.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.4">And when he had apprehended him, he cast him into prison, delivering him
to four files of soldiers to be kept, intending, after the pasch, to bring
him forth to the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.5">Peter therefore was kept in prison.  But prayer was made without ceasing
by the church unto God for him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.6">And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was
sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains:  and the keepers
before the door kept the prison.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.7">And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him:  and a light shined in the
room:  and he striking Peter on the side, raised him up, saying:  Arise
quickly.  And the chains fell off from his hands.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.8">And the angel said to him:  Gird thyself, and put on thy sandals.  And he
did so.  And he said to him:  Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.9">And going out, he followed him, and he knew not that it was true which
was done by the angel:  but thought he saw a vision.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.10">And passing through the first and the second ward, they came to the iron
gate that leadeth to the city, which of itself opened to them.  And going out,
they passed on through one street:  and immediately the angel departed from him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.11">And Peter coming to himself, said:  Now I know in very deed, that the
Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and
from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.12">And considering, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who
was surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together and praying.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.13">And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken,
whose name was Rhode.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.14">And as soon as she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for joy,
but running in she told that Peter stood before the gate.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.15">But they said to her:  Thou art mad.  But she affirmed that it was so.
Then said they:  It is his angel.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.16">But Peter continued knocking.  And when they had opened, they saw him, and
were astonished.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.17">But he beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace, told how the
Lord had brought him out of prison, and he said:  Tell these things to
James, and to the brethren.  And going out, he went into another place.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.18">Now when day was come, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what
was become of Peter.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.19">And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not; having examined
the keepers, he commanded they should be put to death; and going down from
Judea to Caesarea, he abode there.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.20">And he was angry with the Tyrians and the Sidonians.  But they with one
accord came to him, and having gained Blastus, who was the king's
chamberlain, they desired peace, because their countries were nourished
by him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.21">And upon a day appointed, Herod being arrayed in kingly apparel, sat in
the judgment seat, and made an oration to them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.22">And the people made acclamation, saying:  It is the voice of a god, and
not of a man.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.23">And forthwith an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not given
the honour to God:  and being eaten up by worms, he gave up the ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.24">But the word of the Lord increased and multiplied.

</p>
               <p n="N5.12.25">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having fulfilled their
ministry, taking with them John, who was surnamed Mark.

               <head>Chapter 13</head>
               <p n="N5.13.1">Now there were in the church which was at Antioch, prophets and doctors,
among whom was Barnabas, and Simon who was called Niger, and Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manahen, who was the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and
Saul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.2">And as they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Ghost
said to them:  Separate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work whereunto I have
taken them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.3">Then they, fasting and praying, and imposing their hands upon them, sent
them away.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.4">So they being sent by the Holy Ghost, went to Seleucia:  and from thence
they sailed to Cyprus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.5">And when they were come to Salamina, they preached the word of God in
the synagogues of the Jews.  And they had John also in the ministry.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.6">And when they had gone through the whole island, as far as Paphos, they
found a certain man, a magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was
Bar-jesu:

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.7">Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a prudent man.  He sending for
Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.8">But Elymas the magician (for so his name is interpreted) withstood them,
seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.9">Then Saul, otherwise Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, looking upon him,

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.10">Said:  O full of all guile, and of all deceit, child of the devil, enemy
of all justice, thou ceasest not to pervert the right ways of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.11">And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be
blind, not seeing the sun for a time.  And immediately there fell a mist and
darkness upon him, and going about, he sought some one to lead him by
the hand.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.12">Then the proconsul, when he had seen what was done, believed, admiring
at the doctrine of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.13">Now when Paul and they that were with him had sailed from Paphos, they
came to Perge in Pamphylia.  And John departing from them, returned to
Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.14">But they passing through Perge, came to Antioch in Pisidia:  and entering
into the synagogue on the sabbath day, they sat down.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.15">And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the
synagogue sent to them, saying:  Ye men, brethren, if you have any word
of exhortation to make to the people, speak.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.16">Then Paul rising up, and with his hand bespeaking silence, said:  Ye men
of Israel, and you that fear God, give ear.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.17">The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the
people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm
brought them out from thence,

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.18">And for the space of forty years endured their manners in the desert.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.19">And destroying seven nations in the land of Chanaan, divided their land
among them, by lot,

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.20">As it were, after four hundred and fifty years:  and after these things,
he gave unto them judges, until Samuel the prophet.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.21">And after that they desired a king:  and God gave them Saul the son of
Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.22">And when he had removed him, he raised them up David to be king:  to whom
giving testimony, he said:  I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man
according to my own heart, who shall do all my wills.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.23">Of this man's seed God according to his promise, hath raised up to
Israel a Saviour, Jesus:

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.24">John first preaching, before his coming, the baptism of penance to all
the people of Israel.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.25">And when John was fulfilling his course, he said:  I am not he, whom you
think me to be:  but behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of
his feet I am not worthy to loose.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.26">Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you
fear God, to you the word of this salvation is sent.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.27">For they that inhabited Jerusalem, and the rulers thereof, not knowing
him, nor the voices of the prophets, which are read every sabbath, judging
him have fulfilled them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.28">And finding no cause of death in him, they desired of Pilate, that they
might kill him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.29">And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, taking
him down from the tree, they laid him in a sepulchre.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.30">But God raised him up from the dead the third day:

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.31">Who was seen for many days, by them who came up with him from Galilee to
Jerusalem, who to this present are his witnesses to the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.32">And we declare unto you, that the promise which was made to our fathers,

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.33">This same God hath fulfilled to our children, raising up Jesus, as in
the second psalm also is written:  Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.34">And to shew that he raised him up from the dead, not to return now any
more to corruption, he said thus:  I will give you the holy things of David
faithful.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.35">And therefore, in another place also, he saith:  Thou shalt not suffer
thy holy one to see corruption.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.36">For David, when he had served in his generation, according to the will
of God, slept:  and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.37">But he whom God hath raised from the dead, saw no corruption.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.38">Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that through him
forgiveness of sins is preached to you:  and from all the things, from which you
could not be justified by the law of Moses.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.39">In him every one that believeth, is justified.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.40">Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the
prophets:

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.41">Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish:  for I work a work in your
days, a work which you will not believe, if any man shall tell it you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.42">And as they went out, they desired them, that on the next sabbath, they
would speak unto them these words.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.43">And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the Jews, and of the
strangers who served God, followed Paul and Barnabas:  who speaking to
them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.44">But the next sabbath day, the whole city almost came together, to hear
the word of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.45">And the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with envy, and
contradicted those things which were said by Paul, blaspheming.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.46">Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly:  To you it behoved us first to speak
the word of God:  but because you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of
eternal life, behold we turn to the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.47">For so the Lord hath commanded us:  I have set thee to be the light of
the Gentiles; that thou mayest be for salvation unto the utmost part of the
earth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.48">And the Gentiles hearing it, were glad, and glorified the word of the
Lord:  and as many as were ordained to life everlasting, believed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.49">And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole country.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.50">But the Jews stirred up religious and honourable women, and the chief
men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas:  and cast
them out of their coasts.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.51">But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against them, came to
Iconium.

</p>
               <p n="N5.13.52">And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.

</p>

               <head>Chapter 14</head>
               <p n="N5.14.1">And it came to pass in Iconium, that they entered together into the
synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a very great multitude both of
the Jews and of the Greeks did believe.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.2">But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and incensed the minds of the
Gentiles against the brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.3">A long time therefore they abode there, dealing confidently in the Lord,
who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders
to be done by their hands.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.4">And the multitude of the city was divided; and some of them indeed held
with the Jews, but some with the apostles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.5">And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles and the Jews with
their rulers, to use them contumeliously, and to stone them:

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.6">They understanding it, fled to Lystra, and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia,
and to the whole country round about, and were there preaching the gospel.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.7">And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, a cripple
from his mother's womb, who never had walked.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.8">This same heard Paul speaking.  Who looking upon him, and seeing that he
had faith to be healed,

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.9">Said with a loud voice:  Stand upright on thy feet.  And he leaped up, and
walked.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.10">And when the multitudes had seen what Paul had done, they lifted up
their voice in the Lycaonian tongue, saying:  The gods are come down to us in
the likeness of men;

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.11">And they called Barnabas, Jupiter:  but Paul, Mercury; because he was
chief speaker.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.12">The priest also of Jupiter that was before the city, bringing oxen and
garlands before the gate, would have offered sacrifice with the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.13">Which, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul had heard, rending their
clothes, they leaped out among the people, crying,

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.14">And saying:  Ye men, why do ye these things?  We also are mortals, men
like unto you, preaching to you to be converted from these vain things, to
the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all
things that are in them:

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.15">Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.16">Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony, doing good from
heaven, giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
gladness.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.17">And speaking these things, they scarce restrained the people from
sacrificing to them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.18">Now there came thither certain Jews from Antioch, and Iconium:  and
persuading the multitude, and stoning Paul, drew him out of the city,
thinking him to be dead.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.19">But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and entered into
the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.20">And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many,
they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch:

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.21">Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in
the faith:  and that through many tribulations we must enter into the
kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.22">And when they had ordained to them priests in every church, and had
prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, in whom they believed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.23">And passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.24">And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perge, they went down into
Attalia:

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.25">And thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been delivered
to the grace of God, unto the work which they accomplished.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.26">And when they were come, and had assembled the church, they related what
great things God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of
faith to the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.14.27">And they abode no small time with the disciples.

               <head>Chapter 15</head>
               <p n="N5.15.1">And some coming down from Judea, taught the brethren:  That except you be
circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.2">And when Paul and Barnabas had no small contest with them, they
determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of the other side, should go
up to the apostles and priests to Jerusalem about this question.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.3">They therefore being brought on their way by the church, passed through
Phenice, and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they
caused great joy to all the brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.4">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church,
and by the apostles and ancients, declaring how great things God had done
with them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.5">But there arose some of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, saying:
They must be circumcised, and be commanded to observe the law of Moses.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.6">And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this matter.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.7">And when there had been much disputing, Peter, rising up, said to them:
Men, brethren, you know, that in former days God made choice among us,
that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and
believe.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.8">And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the
Holy Ghost, as well as to us;

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.9">And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by
faith.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.10">Now therefore, why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the necks of the
disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.11">But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, in
like manner as they also.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.12">And all the multitude held their peace; and they heard Barnabas and Paul
telling what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles
by them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.13">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying:  Men,
brethren, hear me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.14">Simon hath related how God first visited to take of the Gentiles a
people to his name.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.15">And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.16">After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of
David, which is fallen down; and the ruins thereof I will rebuild, and I will
set it up:

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.17">That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all nations upon
whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who doth these things.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.18">To the Lord was his own work known from the beginning of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.19">For which cause I judge that they, who from among the Gentiles are
converted to God, are not to be disquieted.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.20">But that we write unto them, that they refrain themselves from the
pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled,
and from blood.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.21">For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the
synagogues, where he is read every sabbath.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.22">Then it pleased the apostles and ancients, with the whole church, to
choose men of their own company, and to send to Antioch, with Paul and
Barnabas, namely, Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among
the brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.23">Writing by their hands:  The apostles and ancients, brethren, to the
brethren of the Gentiles that are at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia,
greeting.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.24">Forasmuch as we have heard, that some going out from us have troubled
you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment:

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.25">It hath seemed good to us, being assembled together, to choose out men,
and to send them unto you, with our well beloved Barnabas and Paul:

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.26">Men that have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will, by
word of mouth, tell you the same things.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.28">For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further
burden upon you than these necessary things:

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.29">That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and
from things strangled, and from fornication; from which things keeping
yourselves, you shall do well.  Fare ye well.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.30">They therefore being dismissed, went down to Antioch; and gathering
together the multitude, delivered the epistle.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.31">Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.32">But Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, with many words
comforted the brethren, and confirmed them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.33">And after they had spent some time there, they were let go with peace by
the brethren, unto them that had sent them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.34">But it seemed good unto Silas to remain there; and Judas alone departed
to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.35">And Paul and Barnabas continued at Antioch, teaching and preaching, with
many others, the word of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.36">And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas:  Let us return and visit our
brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the word of the Lord,
to see how they do.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.37">And Barnabas would have taken with them John also, that was surnamed
Mark;

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.38">But Paul desired that he (as having departed from them out of Pamphylia,
and not gone with them to the work) might not be received.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.39">And there arose a dissension, so that they departed one from another;
and Barnabas indeed taking Mark, sailed to Cyprus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.40">But Paul choosing Silas, departed, being delivered by the brethren to
the grace of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.15.41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches,
commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles and the ancients.

               <p n="N5.16.1">And he came to Derbe and Lystra.  And behold, there was a certain
disciple there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman that believed; but his
father was a Gentile.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.2">To this man the brethren that were in Lystra and Iconium, gave a good
testimony.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.3">Him Paul would have to go along with him:  and taking him he circumcised
him, because of the Jews who were in those places.  For they all knew
that his father was a Gentile.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.4">And as they passed through the cities, they delivered unto them the
decrees for to keep, that were decreed by the apostles and ancients who were at
Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.5">And the churches were confirmed in faith, and increased in number daily.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.6">And when they had passed through Phrygia, and the country of Galatia,
they were forbidden by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.7">And when they were come into Mysia, they attempted to go into Bythynia,
and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.8">And when they had passed through Mysia, they went down to Troas.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.9">And a vision was shewed to Paul in the night, which was a man of
Macedonia standing and beseeching him, and saying:  Pass over into Macedonia,
and help us.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.10">And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into
Macedonia, being assured that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.11">And sailing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia,
and the day following to Neapolis;

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.12">And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of part of
Macedonia, a colony.  And we were in this city some days conferring together.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.13">And upon the sabbath day, we went forth without the gate by a river
side, where it seemed that there was prayer; and sitting down, we spoke to the
women that were assembled.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of
Thyatira, one that worshipped God, did hear:  whose heart the Lord opened
to attend to those things which were said by Paul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying:
If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and
abide there.  And she constrained us.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.16">And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl, having a
pythonical spirit, met us, who brought to her masters much gain by
divining.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.17">This same following Paul and us, cried out, saying:  These men are the
servants of the most high God, who preach unto you the way of salvation.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.18">And this she did many days.  But Paul being grieved, turned, and said to
the spirit:  I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out from her.
And he went out the same hour.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.19">But her masters, seeing that the hope of their gain was gone,
apprehending Paul and Silas, brought them into the marketplace to the rulers.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.20">And presenting them to the magistrates, they said:  These men disturb our
city, being Jews;

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.21">And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor
observe, being Romans.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.22">And the people ran together against them; and the magistrates rending
off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into
prison, charging the gaoler to keep them diligently.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.24">Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison,
and made their feet fast in the stocks.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.25">And at midnight, Paul and Silas praying, praised God.  And they that were
in prison, heard them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.26">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of
the prison were shaken.  And immediately all the doors were opened, and the
bands of all were loosed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.27">And the keeper of the prison, awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the
doors of the prison open, drawing his sword, would have killed himself,
supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying:  Do thyself no harm, for we all
are here.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.29">Then calling for a light, he went in, and trembling, fell down at the
feet of Paul and Silas.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.30">And bringing them out, he said:  Masters, what must I do, that I may be
saved?

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.31">But they said:  Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, and
thy house.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.32">And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in
his house.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.33">And he, taking them the same hour of the night, washed their stripes,
and himself was baptized, and all his house immediately.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.34">And when he had brought them into his own house, he laid the table for
them, and rejoiced with all his house, believing God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.35">And when the day was come, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,
Let those men go.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.36">And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul:  The magistrates
have sent to let you go; now therefore depart, and go in peace.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.37">But Paul said to them:  They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men
that are Romans, and have cast us into prison:  and now do they thrust us out
privately?  Not so; but let them come,

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.38">And let us out themselves.  And the serjeants told these words to the
magistrates.  And they were afraid, hearing that they were Romans.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.39">And coming, they besought them; and bringing them out, they desired them
to depart out of the city.

</p>
               <p n="N5.16.40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia;
and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.

               <p n="N5.17.1">And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to
Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.2">And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them; and for three
sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.3">Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer, and to rise
again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.4">And some of them believed, and were associated to Paul and Silas; and of
those that served God, and of the Gentiles a great multitude, and of noble
women not a few.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.5">But the Jews, moved with envy, and taking unto them some wicked men of
the vulgar sort, and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar; and
besetting Jason's house, sought to bring them out unto the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.6">And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers
of the city, crying:  They that set the city in an uproar, are come hither
also;

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.7">Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of
Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.8">And they stirred up the people, and the rulers of the city hearing these
things,

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.9">And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.10">But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto
Berea.  Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.11">Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the
word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things
were so.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.12">And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable women that were
Gentiles, and of men not a few.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.13">And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was
also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and
troubling the multitude.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.14">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea;
but Silas and Timothy remained there.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.15">And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and
receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to
him with all speed, they departed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.16">Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within
him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.17">He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them
that served God, and in the marketplace, every day with them that were there.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.18">And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed
with him; and some said:  What is it, that this word sower would say?  But
others:   He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods; because he preached to them
Jesus and the resurrection.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.19">And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying:  May we know
what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.20">For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears.  We would know
therefore what these things mean.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.21">(Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed
themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.22">But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said:  Ye men of Athens,
I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.23">For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which
was written:  To the unknown God.  What therefore you worship, without knowing
it, that I preach to you:

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.24">God, who made the world, and all things therein; he, being Lord of
heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.25">Neither is he served with men's hands, as though he needed any thing;
seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things:

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.26">And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the
earth, determining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.27">That they should seek God, if happily they may feel after him or find
him, although he be not far from every one of us:

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.28">For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also of your own poets
said:   For we are also his offspring.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.29">Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to
be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.30">And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now
declareth unto men, that all should every where do penance.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.31">Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in
equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving faith to all, by raising him
up from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.32">And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed
mocked, but others said:  We will hear thee again concerning this matter.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.33">So Paul went out from among them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.17.34">But certain men adhering to him, did believe; among whom was also
Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with
them.

               <p n="N5.18.1">After these things, departing from Athens, he came to Corinth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.2">And finding a certain Jew, named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come
from Italy, with Priscilla his wife, (because that Claudius had commanded all
Jews to depart from Rome,) he came to them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.3">And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them, and
wrought; (now they were tentmakers by trade.)

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, bringing in the name of
the Lord Jesus; and he persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.5">And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was earnest in
preaching, testifying to the Jews, that Jesus is the Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.6">But they gainsaying and blaspheming, he shook his garments, and said to
them:  Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean:  from henceforth I
will go unto the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.7">And departing thence, he entered into the house of a certain man, named
Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house was adjoining to the
synagogue.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.8">And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all
his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.9">And the Lord said to Paul in the nights, by a vision:  Do not fear, but
speak; and hold not thy peace,

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.10">Because I am with thee:  and no man shall set upon thee, to hurt thee;
for I have much people in this city.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.11">And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching among them the word
of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose
up against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.13">Saying:  This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.14">And when Paul was beginning to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews:
If it were some matter of injustice, or an heinous deed, O Jews, I should
with reason bear with you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.15">But if they be questions of word and names, and of your law, look you to
it:  I will not be judge of such things.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.17">And all laying hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, beat him
before the judgment seat; and Gallio cared for none of those things.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.18">But Paul, when he had stayed yet many days, taking his leave of the
brethren, sailed thence into Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila),
having shorn his head in Cenchrae:  for he had a vow.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.19">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there.  But he himself entering
into the synagogue, disputed with the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.20">And when they desired him, that he would tarry a longer time, he
consented not;

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.21">But taking his leave, and saying:  I will return to you again, God
willing, he departed from Ephesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.22">And going down to Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, and saluted the
church, and so came down to Antioch.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.23">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went through
the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, confirming all the disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.24">Now a certain Jew, named Apollo, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man,
came to Ephesus, one mighty in the scriptures.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.25">This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in
spirit, spoke, and taught diligently the things that are of Jesus,
knowing only the baptism of John.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.26">This man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue.  Whom when
Priscilla and Aquila had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to
him the way of the Lord more diligently.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.27">And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia, the brethren exhorting,
wrote to the disciples to receive him.  Who, when he was come, helped them much
who had believed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.18.28">For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly, shewing by the
scriptures, that Jesus is the Christ.

</p>

            <div xml:id="n5.19" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter 19</head>
               <p n="N5.19.1">And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having
passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.2">And he said to them:  Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?
But they said to him:  We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy
Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.3">And he said:  In what then were you baptized?  Who said:  In John's
baptism.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.4">Then Paul said:  John baptized the people with the baptism of penance,
saying:  That they should believe in him who was to come after him, that
is to say, in Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.5">Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.6">And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon
them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.7">And all the men were about twelve.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.8">And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three
months, disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.9">But when some were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the way
of the Lord, before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the
disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.10">And this continued for the space of two years, so that all they who
dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.11">And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.12">So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs
and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits
went out of them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.13">Now some also of the Jewish exorcists who went about, attempted to
invoke over them that had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying:  I
conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.14">And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest,
that did this.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.15">But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them:  Jesus I know, and Paul I
know; but who are you?

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.16">And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them, and
mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house
naked and wounded.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.17">And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt at
Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.18">And many of them that believed, came confessing and declaring their
deeds.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.19">And many of them who had followed curious arts, brought together their
books, and burnt them before all; and counting the price of them, they
found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.20">So mightily grew the word of God, and was confirmed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.21">And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he
had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying:  After I
have been there, I must see Rome also.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.22">And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy
and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.23">Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the
Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver
temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.25">Whom he calling together, with the workmen of like occupation, said:
Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade;

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.26">And you see and hear, that this Paul by persuasion hath drawn away a
great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying:  They are
not gods which are made by hands.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.27">So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but
also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing; yea, and her
majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worshippeth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.28">Having heard these things, they were full of anger, and cried out,
saying:  Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.29">And the whole city was filled with confusion; and having caught Gaius
and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions, they rushed with one
accord into the theatre.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.30">And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples
suffered him not.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.31">And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto
him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.32">Now some cried one thing, some another.  For the assembly was confused,
and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.33">And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting
him forward.  And Alexander beckoning with his hand for silence, would have
given the people satisfaction.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.34">But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for
the space of about two hours, cried out:  Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.35">And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said:  Ye men of
Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the
Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana, and of Jupiter's offspring.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.36">For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought
to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.37">For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of
sacrilege, nor of blasphemy against your goddess.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.38">But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter
against any man, the courts of justice are open, and there are proconsuls:  let
them accuse one another.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.39">And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful
assembly.

</p>
               <p n="N5.19.40">For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day's
uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this
concourse.  And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.

exhorting them, took his leave, and set forward to go into Macedonia.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.2">And when he had gone over those parts, and had exhorted them with many
words, he came into Greece;

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.3">Where, when he had spent three months, the Jews laid wait for him, as he
was about to sail into Syria; so he took a resolution to return through
Macedonia.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.4">And there accompanied him Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Berea; and of
the Thessalonians, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and
Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.5">These going before, stayed for us at Troas.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.6">But we sailed from Philippi after the days of the Azymes, and came to
them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.7">And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread,
Paul discoursed with them, being to depart on the morrow:  and he continued
his speech until midnight.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.8">And there were a great number of lamps in the upper chamber where we
were assembled.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.9">And a certain young man named Eutychus, sitting on the window, being
oppressed with a deep sleep, (as Paul was long preaching,) by occasion of
his sleep fell from the third loft down, and was taken up dead.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.10">To whom, when Paul had gone down, he laid himself upon him, and
embracing him, said:  Be not troubled, for his soul is in him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.11">Then going up, and breaking bread and tasting, and having talked a long
time to them, until daylight, so he departed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.12">And they brought the youth alive, and were not a little comforted.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.13">But we, going aboard the ship, sailed to Assos, being there to take in
Paul; for so he had appointed, himself purposing to travel by land.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.14">And when he had met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
Mitylene.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.15">And sailing thence, the day following we came over against Chios; and
the next day we arrived at Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus.

               <p n="N5.20.16">For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, lest he should be stayed any
time in Asia. For he hasted, if it were possible for him, to keep the day
of Pentecost at Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.17">And sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he called the ancients of the
church.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.18">And when they were come to him, and were together, he said to them:  You
know from the first day that I came into Asia, in what manner I have been
with you, for all the time,

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.19">Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and temptations
which befell me by the conspiracies of the Jews;

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.20">How I have kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have
preached it to you, and taught you publicly, and from house to house,

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.21">Testifying both to Jews and Gentiles penance towards God, and faith in
our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.22">And now, behold, being bound in the spirit, I go to Jerusalem:  not
knowing the things which shall befall me there:

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.23">Save that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesseth to me, saying:  That
bands and afflictions wait for me at Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.24">But I fear none of these things, neither do I count my life more
precious than myself, so that I may consummate my course and the ministry of
the word which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the
grace of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.25">And now behold, I know that all you, among whom I have gone preaching
the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.26">Wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood
of all men;

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.27">For I have not spared to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.28">Take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghost
hath placed you bishops, to rule the church of God, which he hath purchased
with his own blood.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.29">I know that, after my departure, ravening wolves will enter in among
you, not sparing the flock.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.30">And of your own selves shall arise men speaking perverse things, to draw
away disciples after them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.31">Therefore watch, keeping in memory, that for three years I ceased not,
with tears to admonish every one of you night and day.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.32">And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able
to build up, and to give an inheritance among all the sanctified.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.33">I have not coveted any man's silver, gold, or apparel, as

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.34">You yourselves know:  for such things as were needful for me and them
that are with me, these hands have furnished.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.35">I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support
the weak, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, how he said:  It is
a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.36">And when he had said these things, kneeling down, he prayed with them
all.

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.37">And there was much weeping among them all; and falling on the neck of
Paul, they kissed him,

</p>
               <p n="N5.20.38">Being grieved most of all for the word which he had said, that they
should see his face no more.  And they brought him on his way to the ship.

               <head>Chapter 21</head>
               <p n="N5.21.1">And when it came to pass that, being parted from them, we set sail, we
came with a straight course to Coos, and the day following to Rhodes, and
from thence to Patara.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.2">And when we had found a ship sailing over to Phenice, we went aboard,
and set forth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.3">And when we had discovered Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we
sailed into Syria, and came to Tyre:  for there the ship was to unlade her
burden.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.4">And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days:  who said to Paul
through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.5">And the days being expired, departing we went forward, they all bringing
us on our way, with their wives and children, till we were out of the city:
and we kneeled down on the shore, and we prayed.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.6">And when we had bid one another farewell, we took ship; and they
returned home.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.7">But we having finished the voyage by sea, from Tyre came down to
Ptolemais:  and saluting the brethren, we abode one day with them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.8">And the next day departing, we came to Caesarea.  And entering into the
house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.9">And he had four daughters, virgins, who did prophesy.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.10">And as we tarried there for some days, there came from Judea a certain
prophet, named Agabus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.11">Who, when he was come to us, took Paul's girdle:  and binding his own
feet and hands, he said:  Thus saith the Holy Ghost:  The man whose girdle this
is, the Jews shall bind in this manner in Jerusalem, and shall deliver him
into the hands of the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.12">Which when we had heard, both we and they that were of that place,
desired him that he would not go up to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.13">Then Paul answered, and said:  What do you mean weeping and afflicting my
heart?  For I am ready not only to be bound, but to die also in Jerusalem, for
the name of the Lord Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.14">And when we could not persuade him, we ceased, saying:  The will of the
Lord be done.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.15">And after those days, being prepared, we went up to Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.16">And there went also with us some of the disciples from Caesarea,
bringing with them one Mnason a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should
lodge.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.17">And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.18">And the day following, Paul went in with us unto James; and all the
ancients were assembled.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.19">Whom when he had saluted, he related particularly what things God had
wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.20">But they hearing it, glorified God, and said to him:  Thou seest,
brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews that have believed:  and
they are all zealous for the law.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.21">Now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews, who are among
the Gentiles, to depart from Moses:  saying, that they ought not to circumcise
their children, nor walk according to the custom.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.22">What is it therefore?  the multitude must needs come together:  for they
will hear that thou art come.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.23">Do therefore this that we say to thee.  We have four men, who have a vow
on them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.24">Take these, and sanctify thyself with them:  and bestow on them, that
they may shave their heads:  and all will know that the things which they have
heard of thee, are false; but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.25">But as touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written, decreeing
that they should only refrain themselves from that which has been offered to
idols, and from blood, and from things strangles, and from fornication.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day being purified with them,
entered into the temple, giving notice of the accomplishment of the days of
purification, until an oblation should be offered for every one of them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.27">But when the seven days were drawing to an end, those Jews that were of
Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and
laid hands upon him, crying out:

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.28">Men of Israel, help:  This is the man that teacheth all men every where
against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover hath brought
in Gentiles into the temple, and hath violated this holy place.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.29">(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom
they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.30">And the whole city was in an uproar:  and the people ran together.  And
taking Paul, they drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors
were shut.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.31">And as they went about to kill him, it was told the tribune of the band,
That all Jerusalem was in confusion.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.32">Who, forthwith taking with him soldiers and centurions, ran down to
them.   And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they left off beating
Paul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.33">Then the tribune coming near, took him, and commanded him to be bound
with two chains:  and demanded who he was, and what he had done.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.34">And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude.  And when he
could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried
into the castle.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.35">And when he was come to the stairs, it fell out that he was carried by
the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.36">For the multitude of the people followed after, crying:  Away with him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.37">And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith to the
tribune:  May speak something to thee?  Who said:  Canst thou speak Greek?

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.38">Art not thou that Egyptian who before these days didst raise a tumult,
and didst lead forth into the desert four thousand men that were murderers?

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.39">But Paul said to him:  I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no
mean city.  And I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.21.40">And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned
with his hand to the people.  And a great silence being made, he spoke unto
them in the Hebrew tongue, saying:

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="n5.22" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter 22</head>
               <p n="N5.22.1">Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye the account which I now give unto
you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.2">(And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, they
kept the more silence.)

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.3">And he saith:  I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in
this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the truth of the law
of the fathers, zealous for the law, as also all you are this day:

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.4">Who persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering into prisons
both men and women.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.5">As the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the ancients:  from whom
also receiving letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus, that I might
bring them bound from thence to Jerusalem to be punished.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.6">And it came to pass, as I was going, and drawing nigh to Damascus at
midday, that suddenly from heaven there shone round about me a great
light:

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.7">And falling on the ground, I heard a voice saying to me:  Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.8">And I answered:  Who art thou, Lord?  And he said to me:  I am Jesus of
Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.9">And they that were with me, saw indeed the light, but they heard not the
voice of him that spoke with me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.10">And I said:  What shall I do, Lord?  And the Lord said to me:  Arise, and
go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things that thou must do.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.11">And whereas I did not see for the brightness of that light, being led by
the hand by my companions, I came to Damascus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.12">And one Ananias, a man according to the law, having testimony of all the
Jews who dwelt there,

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.13">Coming to me, and standing by me, said to me:  Brother Saul, look up.  And
I the same hour looked upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.14">But he said:  The God of our fathers hath preordained thee that thou
shouldst know his will, and see the Just One, and shouldst hear the
voice from his mouth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.15">For thou shalt be his witness to all men, of those things which thou
hast seen and heard.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.16">And now why tarriest thou?  Rise up, and be baptized, and wash away thy
sins, invoking his name.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.17">And it came to pass, when I was come again to Jerusalem, and was praying
in the temple, that I was in a trance,

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.18">And saw him saying unto me:  Make haste, and get thee quickly out of
Jerusalem; because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.19">And I said:  Lord, they know that I cast into prison, and beat in every
synagogue, them that believed in thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.20">And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I stood by and
consented, and kept the garments of them that killed him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.21">And he said to me:  Go, for unto the Gentiles afar off, will I send thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.22">And they heard him until this word, and then lifted up their voice,
saying:  Away with such an one from the earth; for it is not fit that he should
live.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.23">And as they cried out and threw off their garments, and cast dust into
the air,

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.24">The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and that he
should be scourged and tortured:  to know for what cause they did so cry out
against him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.25">And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul saith to the centurion
that stood by him:  Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and
uncondemned?

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.26">Which the centurion hearing, went to the tribune, and told him, saying:
What art thou about to do?  For this man is a Roman citizen.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.27">And the tribune coming, said to him:  Tell me, art thou a Roman?  But he
said:  Yea.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.28">And the tribune answered:  I obtained the being free of this city with a
great sum.  And Paul said:  But I was born so.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.29">Immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to torture
him.  The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he was a Roman
citizen, and because he had bound him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.22.30">But on the next day, meaning to know more diligently for what cause he
was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the priests to come
together, and all the council:  and bringing forth Paul, he set him before
them.

</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="n5.23" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter 23</head>
               <p n="N5.23.1">And Paul looking upon the council, said:  Men, brethren, I have conversed
with all good conscience before God until this present day.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.2">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to strike
him on the mouth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.3">Then Paul said to him:  God shall strike thee, thou whited wall.  For
sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law
commandest me to be struck?

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.4">And they that stood by said:  Dost thou revile the high priest of God?

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.5">And Paul said:  I knew not, brethren, that he is the high priest.  For it
is written:  Thou shalt not speak evil of the prince of thy people.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.6">And Paul knowing that the one part were Sadducees, and the other
Pharisees, cried out in the council:  Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of
Pharisees:  concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called
in question.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.7">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees
and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor
spirit:  but the Pharisees confess both.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.9">And there arose a great cry.  And some of the Pharisees rising up,
strove, saying:  We find no evil in this man.  What if a spirit hath spoken to
him, or an angel?

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.10">And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune fearing lest Paul
should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down,
and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.11">And the night following the Lord standing by him, said:  Be constant; for
as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also
at Rome.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.12">And when day was come, some of the Jews gathered together, and bound
themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat, nor drink,
till they killed Paul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.13">And they were more than forty men that had made this conspiracy.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.14">Who came to the chief priests and the ancients, and said:  We have bound
ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing till we have slain Paul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.15">Now therefore do you with the council signify to the tribune, that he
bring him forth to you, as if you meant to know something more certain
touching him.  And we, before he come near, are ready to kill him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.16">Which when Paul's sister's son had heard, of their lying in wait, he
came and entered into the castle and told Paul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.17">And Paul, calling to him one of the centurions, said:  Bring this young
man to the tribune, for he hath some thing to tell him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.18">And he taking him, brought him to the tribune, and said:  Paul, the
prisoner, desired me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath some
thing to say to thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.19">And the tribune taking him by the hand, went aside with him privately,
and asked him:  What is it that thou hast to tell me?

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.20">And he said:  The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldst
bring forth Paul to morrow into the council, as if they meant to inquire some
thing more certain touching him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.21">But do not thou give credit to them; for there lie in wait for him more
than forty men of them, who have bound themselves by oath neither to
eat, nor to drink, till they have killed him:  and they are now ready, looking
for a promise from thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.22">The tribune therefore dismissed the young man, charging him that he
should tell no man, that he had made known these things unto him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.23">Then having called two centurions, he said to them:  Make ready two
hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two
hundred spearmen for the third hour of the night:

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.24">And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe to
Felix the governor.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.25">(For he feared lest perhaps the Jews might take him away by force and
kill him, and he should afterwards be slandered, as if he was to take money.)
And he wrote a letter after this manner:

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.26">Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.27">This man being taken by the Jews, and ready to be killed by them, I
rescued coming in with an army, understanding that he is a Roman:

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.28">And meaning to know the cause which they objected unto him, I brought
him forth into their council.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.29">Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law; but having
nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bands.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.30">And when I was told of ambushes that they had prepared for him, I sent
him to thee, signifying also to his accusers to plead before thee.  Farewell.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.31">Then the soldiers, according as it was commanded them, taking Paul,
brought him by night to Antipatris.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.32">And the next day, leaving the horsemen to go with him, they returned to
the castle.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.33">Who, when they were come to Caesarea, and had delivered the letter to
the governor, did also present Paul before him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.34">And when he had read it, and had asked of what province he was, and
understood that he was of Cilicia;

</p>
               <p n="N5.23.35">I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers come.  And he commanded him
to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

               <p n="N5.24.1">And after five days the high priest Ananias came down, with some of the
ancients, and one Tertullus an orator, who went to the governor against Paul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.2">And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
Whereas through thee we live in much peace, and many things are rectified by thy
providence,

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.3">We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all
thanksgiving.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.4">But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency
to hear us in few words.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.5">We have found this to be a pestilent man, and raising seditions among
all the Jews throughout the world, and author of the sedition of the sect of
the Nazarenes.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.6">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple:  whom, we having
apprehended, would also have judged according to our law.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.7">But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away
out of our hands;

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.8">Commanding his accusers to come to thee:  of whom thou mayest thyself, by
examination, have knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.9">And the Jews also added, and said that these things were so.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.10">Then Paul answered, (the governor making a sign to him to speak:)
Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with
good courage answer for myself.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.11">For thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days, since I
went up to adore in Jerusalem:

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.12">And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man, or
causing any concourse of the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in
the city:

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.13">Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.14">But this I confess to thee, that according to the way, which they call a
heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which
are written in the law and the prophets:

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.15">Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there
shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.16">And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence
toward God, and towards men.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.17">Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings,
and vows.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.18">In which I was found purified in the temple:  neither with multitude, nor
with tumult.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.19">But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee, and to
accuse, if they had any thing against me:

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.20">Or let these men themselves say, if they found in me any iniquity, when
standing before the council,

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.21">Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them,
Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.22">And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge of this way,
saying:   When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.23">And he commanded a centurion to keep him, and that he should  be easy,
and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.24">And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a
Jew, sent for Paul, and heard of him the faith, that is in Christ Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.25">And as he treated of justice, and chastity, and of the judgment to come,
Felix being terrified, answered:  For this time, go thy way:  but when I
have a convenient time, I will send for thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.26">Hoping also withal, that money should be given him by Paul; for which
cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.24.27">But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus.
And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

               <p n="N5.25.1">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days, he went up
to Jerusalem from Caesarea.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.2">And the chief priests, and principal men of the Jews, went unto him
against Paul:  and they besought him,

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.3">Requesting favour against him, that he would command him to be brought
to Jerusalem, laying wait to kill him in the way.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.4">But Festus answered:  That Paul was kept in Caesarea, and that he himself
would very shortly depart thither.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.5">Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, go down with me,
and accuse him, if there be any crime in the man.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.6">And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days, he went
down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat in the judgment seat; and commanded
Paul to be brought.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.7">Who being brought, the Jews stood about him, who were come down from
Jerusalem, objecting many and grievous causes, which they could not prove;

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.8">Paul making answer for himself:  Neither against the law of the Jews, nor
against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any thing.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.9">But Festus, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, answering Paul, said:
Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.10">Then Paul said:  I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be
judged.  To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.11">For if I have injured them, or have committed any thing worthy of death,
I refuse not to die.  But if there be none of these things whereof they
accuse me, no man may deliver me to them:  I appeal to Caesar.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.12">Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered:  Hast thou
appealed to Caesar?  To Caesar shalt thou go.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.13">And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea to
salute Festus.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.14">And as they tarried there many days, Festus told the king of Paul,
saying:  A certain man was left prisoner by Felix.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.15">About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests, and the ancients
of the Jews, came unto me, desiring condemnation against him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.16">To whom I answered:  It is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any
man, before that he who is accused have his accusers present, and have
liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the things laid to his charge.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.17">When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day
following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.18">Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of
things which I thought ill of:

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.19">But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of
one Jesus deceased, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.20">I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question, asked him
whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.21">But Paul appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I
commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to Caesar.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.22">And Agrippa said to Festus:  I would also hear the man, myself.  To
morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.23">And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp,
and had entered into the hall of audience, with the tribunes, and principal
men of the city, at Festus' commandment, Paul was brought forth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.24">And Festus saith:  King Agrippa, and all ye men who are here present with
us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews dealt with
me at Jerusalem, requesting and crying out that he ought not to live any
longer.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.25">Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But
forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to
send him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.26">Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord.  For which cause I
have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king
Agrippa, that examination being made, I may have what to write.

</p>
               <p n="N5.25.27">For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify
the things laid to his charge.

               <head>Chapter 26</head>
               <p n="N5.26.1">Then Agrippa said to Paul:  Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.  Then
Paul stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.2">I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself
this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the
Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.3">Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions that are
among the Jews:  Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.4">And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my
own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.5">Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that
according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.6">And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the fathers,
do I stand subject to judgment:

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.7">Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come.  For
which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.8">Why should it be thought a thing incredible, that God should raise the
dead?

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.9">And I indeed did formerly think, that I ought to do many things contrary
to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.10">Which also I did at Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in
prison, having received authority of the chief priests:  and when they were
put to death, I brought the sentence.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.11">And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to
blaspheme:  and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even
unto foreign cities.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.12">Whereupon when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of
the chief priest,

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.13">At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the
brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them that were in
company with me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.14">And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking
to me in the Hebrew tongue:  Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  It is hard
for thee to kick against the goad.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.15">And I said:  Who art thou, Lord?  And the Lord answered:  I am Jesus whom
thou persecutest.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.16">But rise up, and stand upon thy feet:  for to this end have I appeared to
thee, that I may make thee a minister, and a witness of those things which
thou hast seen, and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.17">Delivering thee from the people, and from the nations, unto which now I
send thee:

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.18">To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.19">Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision:

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.20">But to them first that are at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and unto all
the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do
penance, and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.21">For this cause the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended
me, went about to kill me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.22">But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing
both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets,
and Moses did say should come to pass:

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.23">That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should
rise from the dead, and should shew light to the people, and to the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.24">As he spoke these things, and made his answer, Festus said with a loud
voice:  Paul, thou art beside thyself:  much learning doth make thee mad.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.25">And Paul said:  I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of
truth and soberness.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.26">For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with
confidence.   For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him.  For neither was any of these things done in a corner.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.27">Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa?  I know that thou believest.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.28">And Agrippa said to Paul:  In a little thou persuadest me to become a
Christian.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.29">And Paul said:  I would to God, that both in a little and in much, not
only thou, but also all that hear me, this day, should become such as I also
am, except these bands.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.30">And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat
with them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.31">And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying:  This
man hath done nothing worthy of  death or of bands.

</p>
               <p n="N5.26.32">And Agrippa said to Festus:  This man might have been set at liberty, if
he had not appealed to Caesar.

               <p n="N5.27.1">And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy, and that
Paul, with the other prisoners, should be delivered to a centurion, named
Julius, of the band Augusta,

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.2">Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the
coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with
us.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.3">And the day following we came to Sidon.  And Julius treating Paul
courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, and to take care of
himself.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.4">And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because
the winds were contrary.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.5">And sailing over the sea of Cilicia, and Pamphylia, we came to Lystra,
which is in Lycia:

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.6">And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy,
removed us into it.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.7">And when for many days we had sailed slowly, and were scarce come over
against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone:

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.8">And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place, which is
called Good-havens, nigh to which was the city of Thalassa.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.9">And when much time was spent, and when sailing now was dangerous,
because the fast was now past, Paul comforted them,

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.10">Saying to them:  Ye men, I see that the voyage beginneth to be with
injury and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.11">But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more
than those things which were said by Paul.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.12">And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest
part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice to
winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the southwest and
northwest.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.13">And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they had obtained their
purpose, when they had loosed from Asson, they sailed close by Crete.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.14">But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called
Euroaquilo.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.15">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up against the wind,
giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.16">And running under a certain island, that is called Cauda, we had much
work to come by the boat.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.17">Which being taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship, and
fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they let down the sail yard,
and so were driven.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.18">And we being mightily tossed with the tempest, the next day they
lightened the ship.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.19">And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the
ship.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.20">And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small
storm lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.21">And after they had fasted a long time, Paul standing forth in the midst
of them, said:  You should indeed, O ye men, have hearkened unto me, and not
have loosed from Crete, and have gained this harm and loss.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer.  For there shall be no loss of
any man's life among you, but only of the ship.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.23">For an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, stood by me this
night,

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.24">Saying:  Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar; and behold,
God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.25">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God that it shall so
be, as it hath been told me.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.26">And we must come unto a certain island.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.27">But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were sailing in Adria,
about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they discovered some country.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.28">Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms; and going on a little further,
they found fifteen fathoms.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.29">Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four
anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.30">But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the
boat into the sea, under colour, as though they would have cast anchors out
of the forepart of the ship,

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.31">Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers:  Except these stay in
the ship, you cannot be saved.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.32">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.33">And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all to take meat,
saying:  This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited, and continued
fasting, taking nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.34">Wherefore I pray you to take some meat for your health's sake; for there
shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.35">And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to God
in the sight of them all; and when he had broken it, he began to eat.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.36">Then were they all of better cheer, and they also took some meat.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.37">And we were in all in the ship, two hundred threescore and sixteen
souls.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting the
wheat into the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.39">And when it was day, they knew not the land; but they discovered a
certain creek that had a shore, into which they minded, if they could, to thrust
in the ship.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.40">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the
sea, loosing withal the rudder bands; and hoisting up the mainsail to the
wind, they made towards shore.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.41">And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met, they run the
ship aground; and the forepart indeed, sticking fast, remained unmoveable:
but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.42">And the soldiers' counsel was, that they should kill the prisoners, lest
any of them, swimming out, should escape.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.43">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done; and he
commanded that they who could swim, should cast themselves first into
the sea, and save themselves, and get to land.

</p>
               <p n="N5.27.44">And the rest, some they carried on boards, and some on those things that
belonged to the ship.  And so it came to pass, that every soul got safe to land.

               <p n="N5.28.1">And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.
But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.2">For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because of the present rain,
and of the cold.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.3">And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks, and had laid
them on the fire, a viper coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.4">And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand, they said one
to another:  Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, who though he hath escaped
the sea, yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.5">And he indeed shaking off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.6">But they supposed that he would begin to swell up, and that he would
suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long, and seeing that there
came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said, that he was a god.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.7">Now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the island,
named Publius, who receiving us, for three days entertained us courteously.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.8">And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever, and of a
bloody flux.  To whom Paul entered in; and when he had prayed, and laid
his hands on him, he healed him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.9">Which being done, all that had diseases in the island, came and were
healed:

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.10">Who also honoured us with many honours, and when we were to set sail,
they laded us with such things as were necessary.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.11">And after three months, we sailed in a ship of Alexandria, that had
wintered in the island, whose sign was the Castors.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.12">And when we were come to Syracusa, we tarried there three days.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.13">From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to Rhegium:  and after one
day, the south wind blowing, we came the second day to Puteoli;

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.14">Where, finding brethren, we were desired to tarry with them seven days:
and so we went to Rome.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.15">And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet us
as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns:  whom when Paul saw, he gave
thanks to God, and took courage.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.16">And when we were come to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself,
with a soldier that kept him.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.17">And after the third day, he called together the chief of the Jews.  And
when they were assembled, he said to them:  Men, brethren, I, having done
nothing against the people, or the custom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner
from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans;

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.18">Who, when they had examined me, would have released me, for that there
was no cause of death in me;

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.19">But the Jews contradicting it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar;
not that I had any thing to accuse my nation of.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.20">For this cause therefore I desired to see you, and to speak to you.
Because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.21">But they said to him:  We neither received letters concerning thee from
Judea, neither did any of the brethren that came hither, relate or speak
any evil of thee.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for as concerning this
sect, we know that it is every where contradicted.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.23">And when they had appointed him a day, there came very many to him unto
his lodgings; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and
persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law of Moses and the
prophets, from morning until evening.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.24">And some believed the things that were said; but some believed not.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, Paul speaking
this one word:  Well did the Holy Ghost speak to our fathers by Isaias
the prophet,

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.26">Saying:  Go to this people, and say to them:  With the ear you shall hear,
and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.27">For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears have
they heard heavily, and their eyes they have shut; lest perhaps they should
see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their
heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.28">Be it known therefore to you, that this salvation of God is sent to the
Gentiles, and they will hear it.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.29">And when he had said these things, the Jews went out from him, having
much reasoning among themselves.

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.30">And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging; and he
received all that came in to him,

</p>
               <p n="N5.28.31">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things which concern the
Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, without prohibition.

separated unto the gospel of God,

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.2">Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy
scriptures,

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.3">Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David,
according to the flesh,

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.4">Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the
spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
Christ from the dead;

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.5">By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to
the faith, in all nations, for his name;

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.6">Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.7">To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be
saints.  Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.8">First I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you
all, because your faith is spoken of in the whole world.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.9">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel
of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you;

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.10">Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at
length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come
unto you.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.11">For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
grace, to strengthen you:

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.12">That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you, by that
which is common to us both, your faith and mine.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.13">And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often
purposed to come unto you, (and have been hindered hitherto,) that I
might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.14">To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the
unwise, I am a debtor;

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.15">So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you
also that are at Rome.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel.  For it is the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to
the Greek.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.17">For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto
faith, as it is written:  The just man liveth by faith.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God
in injustice:

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.19">Because that which is known of God is manifest in them.  For God
hath manifested it unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.20">For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world,
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his
eternal power also, and divinity:  so that they are inexcusable.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.21">Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as
God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their
foolish heart was darkened.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.22">For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.23">And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the
likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of
fourfooted beasts, and of creeping things.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.24">Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto
uncleanness, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.25">Who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and
served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for
ever.  Amen.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.26">For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections.  For
their women have changed the natural use into that use which is
against nature.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.27">And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the
women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men
working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense
which was due to their error.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.28">And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered
them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not
convenient;

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.29">Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice,
wickedness, full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity,
whisperers,

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.30">Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty,
inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.31">Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity, without
mercy.

</p>
               <p n="N6.1.32">Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that
they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do
them, but they also that consent to them that do them.

thyself.  For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.

</p>

to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

               <p n="N6.2.12">For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without
the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by
the law.

</p>
               <p n="N6.2.13">For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers
of the law shall be justified.

               <p n="N6.2.14">For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those
things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to

just.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.9">What then?  Do we excel them?  No, not so.  For we have charged
both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.10">As it is written:  There is not any man just.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
after God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.12">All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable
together:  there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
dealt deceitfully.  The venom of asps is under their lips.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.15">Their feet swift to shed blood:

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.16">Destruction and misery in their ways:

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.17">And the way of peace they have not known:

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.19">Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it
speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.20">Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified
before him.  For by the law is the knowledge of sin.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.21">But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.22">Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and
upon all them that believe in him:  for there is no distinction:

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.23">For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.24">Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that
is in Christ Jesus,

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.25">Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in
his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of
former sins,

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.26">Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice
in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him,
who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.27">Where is then thy boasting?  It is excluded.  By what law?  Of
works?  No, but by the law of faith.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.28">For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works
of the law.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.29">Is he the God of the Jews only?  Is he not also of the Gentiles?
Yes, of the Gentiles also.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.30">For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and
uncircumcision through faith.

</p>
               <p n="N6.3.31">Do we, then, destroy the law through faith?  God forbid:  but we
establish the law.

               <p n="N6.4.1">What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our
father according to the flesh.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.2">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to
glory, but not before God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.3">For what saith the scripture?  Abraham believed God, and it was
reputed to him unto justice.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.4">Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to
grace, but according to debt.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.5">But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according
to the purpose of the grace of God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.6">As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God
reputeth justice without works:

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.7">Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
are covered.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.8">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.9">This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only,
or in the uncircumcision also?  For we say that unto Abraham faith
was reputed to justice.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.10">How then was it reputed?  When he was in circumcision, or in
uncircumcision?  Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice
of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be
the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto
them also it may be reputed to justice:

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.12">And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that
are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of
the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.13">For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his
seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice
of faith.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.14">For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the
promise is made of no effect.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.15">For the law worketh wrath.  For where there is no law, neither
is there transgression.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.16">Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise
might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law,
but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father
of us all,

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.17">(As it is written:  I have made thee a father of many nations,)
before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth
those things that are not, as those that are.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.18">Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the
father of many nations, according to that which was said to him:
So shall thy seed be.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.19">And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own
body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the
dead womb of Sara.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.20">In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but
was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.21">Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able
also to perform.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.22">And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.23">Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him
unto justice,

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.24">But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in
him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,

</p>
               <p n="N6.4.25">Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our
justification.

through our Lord Jesus Christ:

wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of
God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.3">And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing
that tribulation worketh patience;

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.4">And patience trial; and trial hope;

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.5">And hope confoundeth not:  because the charity of God is poured
forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.6">For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the
time, die for the ungodly?

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.7">For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good
man some one would dare to die.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.8">But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet
we were sinners, according to the time,

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.9">Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by
his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.10">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by
his life.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.11">And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.12">Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin
death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.13">For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not
imputed, when the law was not.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.14">But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who
have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam,
who is a figure of him who was to come.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.15">But not as the offence, so also the gift.  For if by the
offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift,
by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.16">And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift.  For judgment
indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences,
unto justification.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.17">For if by one man's offence death reigned through one; much
more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of
justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.18">Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to
condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to
justification of life.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.19">For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners;
so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.20">Now the law entered in, that sin might abound.  And where sin
abounded, grace did more abound.

</p>
               <p n="N6.5.21">That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by
justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we

also together with Christ:

he liveth unto God:

the lusts thereof.

               <p n="N6.6.13">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto
sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the
dead, and your members as instruments of justice unto God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.6.14">For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under
the law, but under grace.

</p>
               <p n="N6.6.15">What then?  Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but

have obeyed from the heart, unto that form of doctrine, into which
you have been delivered.

unto sanctification.

</p>

detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in
the oldness of the letter.

</p>
               <p n="N6.7.7">What shall we say, then?  Is the law sin?  God forbid.  But I
do not know sin, but by the law; for I had not known concupiscence,
if the law did not say:  Thou shalt not covet.

</p>
               <p n="N6.7.8">But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence.  For without the law sin was dead.

same was found to be unto death to me.

               <p n="N6.7.11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me, and by
it killed me.

</p>
               <p n="N6.7.12">Wherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and
just, and good.

</p>
               <p n="N6.7.13">Was that then which is good, made death unto me?  God forbid.
But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good, wrought
death in me; that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above
measure.

</p>

flesh, that which is good.  For to will, is present with me; but to
accomplish that which is good, I find not.

</p>
               <p n="N6.7.19">For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I will
not, that I do.

               <p n="N6.8.10">And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of
sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.11">And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead,
dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall
quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth
in you.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.12">Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
according to the flesh.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.13">For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die:  but if
by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.14">For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons
of God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.15">For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear;
but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we
cry:  Abba (Father).

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.16">For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit, that we
are the sons of God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.17">And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs
with Christ:  yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also
glorified with him.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.19">For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation
of the sons of God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.20">For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
by reason of him that made it subject, in hope:

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.21">Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the
servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the
children of God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.22">For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in
pain, even till now.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.23">And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits
of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for
the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.24">For we are saved by hope.  But hope that is seen, is not hope.
For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.25">But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with
patience.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.26">Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity.  For we know
not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself
asketh for us with unspeakable groanings.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.27">And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what the Spirit
desireth; because he asketh for the saints according to God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.28">And we know that to them that love God, all things work
together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called
to be saints.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.29">For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made
conformable to the image of his Son; that he might be the firstborn
amongst many brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.30">And whom he predestinated, them he also called.  And whom he
called, them he also justified.  And whom he justified, them he also
glorified.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.31">What shall we then say to these things?  If God be for us, who
is against us?

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.32">He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for
us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.33">Who shall accuse against the elect of God?  God that
justifieth.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.34">Who is he that shall condemn?  Christ Jesus that died, yea that
is risen also again; who is at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.35">Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Shall
tribulation?  or distress?  or famine?  or nakedness?  or danger?  or
persecution?  or the sword?

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.36">(As it is written:  For thy sake we are put to death all the day
long.  We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.37">But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath
loved us.

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.38">For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor might,

</p>
               <p n="N6.8.39">Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

               <p n="N6.9.1">I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing
me witness in the Holy Ghost:

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.2">That I have great sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.3">For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my
brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh,

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.4">Who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as of
children, and the glory, and the testament, and the giving of the
law, and the service of God, and the promises:

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.5">Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, according to the
flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever.  Amen.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.6">Not as though the word of God hath miscarried.  For all are not
Israelites that are of Israel:

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.7">Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children;
but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.8">That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh,
are the children of God; but they, that are the children of the
promise, are accounted for the seed.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.9">For this is the word of promise:  According to this time will I
come; and Sara shall have a son.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.10">And not only she.  But when Rebecca also had conceived at once,
of Isaac our father.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.11">For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good
or evil (that the purpose of God, according to election, might
stand,)

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.12">Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her:  The
elder shall serve the younger.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.13">As it is written:  Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.14">What shall we say then?  Is there injustice with God?  God
forbid.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.15">For he saith to Moses:  I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.16">So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
but of God that sheweth mercy.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.17">For the scripture saith to Pharao:  To this purpose have I
raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may
be declared throughout all the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.18">Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he
hardeneth.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.19">Thou wilt say therefore to me:  Why doth he then find fault?  for
who resisteth his will?

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.20">O man, who art thou that repliest against God?  Shall the thing
formed say to him that formed it:  Why hast thou made me thus?

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.21">Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump,
to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.22">What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power
known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for
destruction,

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.23">That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of
mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory?

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.24">Even us, whom also he hath called, nor only of the Jews, but
also of the Gentiles.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.25">As in Osee he saith:  I will call that which was not my people,
my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had
not obtained mercy, one that hath obtained mercy.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.26">And it shall be, in the place where it was said unto them, You
are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living
God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.27">And Isaias crieth out concerning Israel:  If the number of the
children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be
saved.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.28">For he shall finish his word, and cut it short in justice;
because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.29">And as Isaias foretold:  Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us
a seed, we had been made as Sodom, and we had been like unto
Gomorrha.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.30">What then shall we say?  That the Gentiles, who followed not
after justice, have attained to justice, even the justice that is of
faith.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.31">But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come
unto the law of justice.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.32">Why so?  Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of
works.  For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.

</p>
               <p n="N6.9.33">As it is written:  Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and a
rock of scandal; and whosoever believeth in him shall not be
confounded.

               <p n="N6.10.1">Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed, and my prayer to God,
is for them unto salvation.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.2">For I bear them witness, that they have a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.3">For they, not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to
establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of
God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.4">For the end of the law is Christ, unto justice to every one
that believeth.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.5">For Moses wrote, that the justice which is of the law, the man
that shall do it, shall live by it.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.6">But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus:  Say not in
thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?  that is, to bring Christ
down;

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.7">Or who shall descend into the deep?  that is, to bring up
Christ again from the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.8">But what saith the scripture?  The word is nigh thee, even in
thy mouth, and in thy heart.  This is the word of faith, which we
preach.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.9">For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe
in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt
be saved.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.10">For, with the heart, we believe unto justice; but, with the
mouth, confession is made unto salvation.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.11">For the scripture saith:  Whosoever believeth in him, shall not
be confounded.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.12">For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek:  for the
same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.13">Fro whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be
saved.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.14">How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not
believed?  Or how shall they believe him, of whom they have not
heard?  And how shall they hear, without a preacher?

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.15">And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is
written:  How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel
of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things!

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.16">But all do not obey the gospel.  For Isaias saith:  Lord, who
hath believed our report?

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.17">Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of
Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.18">But I say:  Have they not heard?  Yes, verily, their sound hath
gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the
whole world.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.19">But I say:  Hath not Israel known?  First, Moses saith:  I will
provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a foolish
nation I will anger you.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.20">But Isaias is bold, and saith:  I was found by them that did
not seek me:  I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.

</p>
               <p n="N6.10.21">But to Israel he saith:  All the day long have I spread my
hands to a people that believeth not, and contradicteth me.

               <p n="N6.11.1">I say then:  Hath God cast away his people?  God forbid.  For I
also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
Benjamin.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.2">God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew.  Know you
not what the scripture saith of Elias; how he calleth on God against
Israel?

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.3">Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have dug down thy
altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.4">But what saith the divine answer to him?  I have left me seven
thousand men, that have not bowed their knees to Baal.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.5">Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant
saved according to the election of grace.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.6">And if by grace, it is not now by works:  otherwise grace is no
more grace.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.7">What then?  That which Israel sought, he hath not obtained:  but
the election hath obtained it; and the rest have been blinded.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.8">As it is written:  God hath given them the spirit of
insensibility; eyes that they should not see; and ears that they
should not hear, until this present day.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.9">And David saith:  Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
and a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see:  and bow
down their back always.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.11">I say then, have they so stumbled, that they should fall?  God
forbid.  But by their offence, salvation is come to the Gentiles,
that they may be emulous of them.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.12">Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world, and the
diminution of them, the riches of the Gentiles; how much more the
fulness of them?

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.13">For I say to you, Gentiles:  as long indeed as I am the apostle
of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.14">If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my
flesh, and may save some of them.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.15">For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world,
what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.16">For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also:  and if the
root be holy, so are the branches.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.17">And if some of the branches be broken, and thou, being a wild
olive, art ingrafted in them, and art made partaker of the root, and
of the fatness of the olive tree,

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.18">Boast not against the branches.  But if thou boast, thou
bearest not the root, but the root thee.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.19">Thou wilt say then:  The branches were broken off, that I might
be grafted in.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.20">Well:  because of unbelief they were broken off.  But thou
standest by faith:  be not highminded, but fear.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.21">For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest
perhaps he also spare not thee.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.22">See then the goodness and the severity of God:  towards them
indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness
of God, if thou abide in goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut
off.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.23">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
grafted in:  for God is able to graft them in again.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.24">For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is
natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the good
olive tree; how much more shall they that are the natural branches,
be grafted into their own olive tree?

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.25">For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery,
(lest you should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in
part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles
should come in.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.26">And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written:  There
shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn away
ungodliness from Jacob.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.27">And this is to them my covenant:  when I shall take away their
sins.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.28">As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your
sake:  but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake
of the fathers.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.29">For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.30">For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have
obtained mercy, through their unbelief;

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.31">So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they
also may obtain mercy.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.32">For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy
on all.

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.33">O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of
God!  How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable
his ways!

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.34">For who hath known the mind of the Lord?  Or who hath been his
counsellor?

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.35">Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made
him?

</p>
               <p n="N6.11.36">For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things:  to him be

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.4">For as in one body we have many members, but all the members
have not the same office:

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.5">So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
one of another.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.6">And having different gifts, according to the grace that is
given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of
faith;

               <p n="N6.12.7">Or ministry, in ministering; or he that teacheth, in doctrine;

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.8">He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with
simplicity; he that ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth mercy,
with cheerfulness.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.9">Let love be without dissimulation.  Hating that which is evil,
cleaving to that which is good.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.10">Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour
preventing one another.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.11">In carefulness not slothful.  In spirit fervent.  Serving the
Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.12">Rejoicing in hope.  Patient in tribulation.  Instant in prayer.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.13">Communicating to the necessities of the saints.  Pursuing
hospitality.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.14">Bless them that persecute you:  bless, and curse not.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.15">Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.16">Being of one mind one towards another.  Not minding high
things, but consenting to the humble.  Be not wise in your own
conceits.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.17">To no man rendering evil for evil.  Providing good things, not
only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.18">If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all
men.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.19">Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto
wrath, for it is written:  Revenge is mind, I will repay, saith the
Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N6.12.20">But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst,
give him to drink.  For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire
upon his head.

</p>

Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?  Do that which is good:

shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness:  Thou shalt not
covet:  and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in
this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

</p>
               <p n="N6.13.10">The love of our neighbour worketh no evil.  Love therefore is
the fulfilling of the law.

that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth.  For God hath
taken him to him.

he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to
God.

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N6.14.8">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die,
we die unto the Lord.  Therefore, whether we live, or whether we
die, we are the Lord's.

</p>

seat of Christ.

reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.4">For what things soever were written, were written for our

we might have hope.

unto the honour of God.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.8">For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision
for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.9">But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it
is written:  Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the
Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.10">And again he saith:  Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.14">And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.19">By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy
Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum,
I have replenished the gospel of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.20">And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named,
lest I should build upon another man's foundation.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.21">But as it is written:  They to whom he was not spoken of, shall
see, and they that have not heard shall understand.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.22">For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to
you, and have been kept away till now.

as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you,
if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you:

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.25">But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.26">For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.27">For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors.  For if
the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things,
they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.28">When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to
them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.29">And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the

</p>
               <p n="N6.15.30">I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus

               <p n="N7.1.10">Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among
you; but that you be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.11">For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them
that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.12">Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul;
and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and I of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.13">Is Christ divided?  Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you
baptized in the name of Paul?

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.14">I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus
and Caius;

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.15">Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.16">And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know
not whether I baptized any other.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.17">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not
in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.18">For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is
foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the
power of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.19">For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the
prudence of the prudent I will reject.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.20">Where is the wise?  Where is the scribe?  Where is the disputer of
this world?  Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.21">For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew
not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to
save them that believe.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.22">For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after
wisdom:

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.23">But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a
stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.24">But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
power of God, and the wisdom of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.25">For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of
God is stronger than men.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.26">For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise
according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble:

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.27">But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may
confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen,
that he may confound the strong.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.28">And the base things of the world, and the things that are
contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might
bring to nought things that are:

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.29">That no flesh should glory in his sight.

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.30">But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:

</p>
               <p n="N7.1.31">That, as it is written: He that glorieth, may glory in the Lord.

               <head>Chapter 2</head>
               <p n="N7.2.1">And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of
speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.2">For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus
Christ, and him crucified.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.4">And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words
of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power;

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.5">That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the
power of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.6">Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of
this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought;

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.7">But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is
hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory :

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.8">Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known
it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.9">But, as it is written:  That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath
prepared for them that love him.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.10">But to us God hath revealed them, by this Spirit.  For the Spirit
searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.11">For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man
that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth,
but the Spirit of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.12">Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit
that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.13">Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom;
but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.14">But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the
Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand,
because it is spiritually examined.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.15">But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged
of no man.

</p>
               <p n="N7.2.16">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him?
But we have the mind of Christ.

as unto carnal.  As unto little ones in Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.2">I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as
yet.  But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet
carnal.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.3">For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you
not carnal, and walk according to man ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.4">For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of
Apollo; are you not men ?  What then is Apollo, and what is Paul?

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.5">The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one
as the Lord hath given.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.6">I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.7">Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that
watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.8">Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, ate one.  And every
man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.9">For we are God's coadjutors: you are God's husbandry; you are
God's building.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.10">According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise
architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth
thereon.  But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.11">For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid;
which is Christ Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.12">Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.13">Every man's work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord
shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the
fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.14">If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he
shall receive a reward.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.15">If any man's work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself
shall be saved, yet so as by fire.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.16">Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the
Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.17">But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God
destroy.  For the temple of God is holy, which you are.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.18">Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be
wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it
is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.

</p>
               <p n="N7.3.20">And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that
they are vain.

dispensers of the mysteries of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.2">Here now it is required among the dispensers, that a man be
found faithful.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.3">But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by
man's day; but neither do I judge my own self.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.4">For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not
hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.5">Therefore judge not before the time; until the Lord come, who

man have praise from God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.6">But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us you may learn,
that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above
that which is written.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.7">For who distinguisheth thee ?  Or what hast thou that thou hast
not received ?  And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory,
as if thou hadst not received it ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.8">You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without
us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign
with you.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.9">For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as
it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the
world, and to angels, and to men.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we
are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without
honour.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.11">Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked,
and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.12">And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and
we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.13">We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse
of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.

</p>
               <p n="N7.4.14">I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you
as my dearest children.

</p>

many fathers.  For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have
begotten you.

of Christ.

church.

know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.

               <p n="N7.7.9">But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry.  For it
is better to marry than to be burnt.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.10">But to them that are married, not I but the Lord commandeth,
that the wife depart not from her husband.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.11">And if she depart, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled
to her husband.  And let not the husband put away his wife.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.12">For to the rest I speak, not the Lord.  If any brother hath a
wife that believeth not, and she consent to dwell with him, let
him not put her away.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.13">And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not, and he
consent to dwell with her, let her not put away her husband.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing
wife; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing
husband: otherwise your children should be unclean; but now they
are holy.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.15">But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart.  For a brother
or sister is not under servitude in such cases.  But God hath
called us in peace.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.16">For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
husband ?  Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save
thy wife ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.17">But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath
called every one, so let him walk: and so in all churches I teach.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.18">Is any man called, being circumcised ?  let him not procure
uncircumcision.  Is any man called in uncircumcision ?  let him
not be circumcised.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but
the observance of the commandments of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.20">Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was
called.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.21">Wast thou called, being a bondman ?  care not for it; but if
thou mayest be made free, use it rather.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.22">For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the
freeman of the Lord.  Likewise he that is called, being free, is
the bondman of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.23">You are bought with a price; be not made the bondslaves of
men.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.24">Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide
with God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.25">Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but
I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be
faithful.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.26">I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity,
that it is good for a man so to be.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.27">Art thou bound to a wife ?  seek not to be loosed.  Art thou
loosed from a wife ?  seek not a wife.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.28">But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned.  And if a
virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have
tribulation of the flesh.  But I spare you.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.29">This therefore I say, brethren; the time is short; it
remaineth, that they also who have wives, be as if they had none;

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.30">And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though
they possessed not;

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.31">And they that use this world, as if they used it not: for the
fashion of this world passeth away.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.32">But I would have you to be without solicitude.  He that is
without a wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the
Lord, how he may please God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.33">But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of
the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.34">And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things
of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.
But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world, how
she may please her husband.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.35">And this I speak for your profit: not to cast a snare upon
you; but for that which is decent, and which may give you power
to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.36">But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured, with regard
to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be:
let him do what he will; he sinneth not, if she marry.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.37">For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart,
having no necessity, but having power of his own will; and hath
judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.38">Therefore, both he that giveth his virgin in marriage, doth
well; and he that giveth her not, doth better.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.39">A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband die, she is at liberty: let her marry to whom she
will; only in the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.7.40">But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to
my counsel; and I think that I also have the spirit of God.

               <p n="N7.8.1">Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we
know that we all have knowledge.  Knowledge puffeth up; but charity
edifieth.

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.2">And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet
known as he ought to know.

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.4">But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that
an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but
one.

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.5">For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or
on earth (for there be gods many, and lords many);

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.6">Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are
all things, and we by him.

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.7">But there is not knowledge in every one.  For some until this
present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed
to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.8">But meat doth not commend us to God.  For neither, if we eat,
shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have the
less.

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.9">But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a
stumblingblock to the weak.

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.10">For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the
idol's temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be
emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.11">And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for
whom Christ hath died ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.12">Now when you sin thus against the brethren, and wound their
weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.8.13">Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat
flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother.

For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.4">Have not we power to eat and to drink?

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.5">Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister, as well as
the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and
Cephas?

feedeth the flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.8">Speak I these things according to man?  Or doth not the law
also say these things?

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.9">For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle
the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn.  Doth God take
care for oxen?

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.10">Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes?  For these things

in hope; and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.11">If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great
matter if we reap your carnal things?

Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.13">Know you not, that they who work in the holy place, eat the
things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar,
partake with the altar?

these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good
for me to die, rather than that any man should make my glory
void.

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.16">For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me, for a
necessity lieth upon me: for woe is unto me if I preach not the
gospel.

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.17">For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if

deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in
the gospel.

</p>

all, that I might gain the more.

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.20">And I became to the Jews, a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:

(whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them
that were under the law.  To them that were without the law, as
if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of
God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that
were without the law.

</p>
               <p n="N7.9.22">To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak.  I
became all things to all men, that I might save all.

</p>
               <p n="N7.10.6">Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should

fornication, and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

that you may be able to bear it.

               <p n="N7.11.20">When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now
to eat the Lord's supper.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.21">For every one taketh before his own supper to eat.  And one
indeed is hungry and another is drunk.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.22">What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in?  Or despise
ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ?  What
shall I say to you?  Do I praise you?  In this I praise you not.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.23">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was
betrayed, took bread.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.24">And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is
my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the
commemoration of me.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.25">In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying:
This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as
often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.26">For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the
chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.27">Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice
of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the
blood of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.28">But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread,
and drink of the chalice.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.29">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.30">Therefore are there many inform and weak among you, and many
sleep.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.31">But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.32">But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that
we be not condemned with this world.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.33">Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait
for one another.

</p>
               <p n="N7.11.34">If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not
together unto judgment.  And the rest I will set in order, when I
come.

               <p n="N7.12.1">Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have
you ignorant.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.2">You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols,
according as you were led.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.3">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by
the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus.  And no man can say
the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.4">Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.5">And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.6">And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who
worketh all in all.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.7">And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto
profit.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.8">To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and
to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.9">To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of
healing in one Spirit;

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.10">To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to
another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of
tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.11">But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing
to every one according as he will.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.12">For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the
members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so
also is Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.13">For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have
all been made to drink.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.14">For the body also is not one member, but many.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.15">If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the body ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.16">And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not
of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.17">If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing?
If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.18">But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body
as it hath pleased him.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.19">And if they all were one member, where would be the body?

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.20">But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.21">And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor
again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.22">Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members
of the body, are more necessary.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.23">And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the
body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are
our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.24">But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant
honour,

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.25">That there might be no schism in the body; but the members
might be mutually careful one for another.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.26">And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer
with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.27">Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.28">And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles,
secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the
graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues,
interpretations of speeches.

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.29">Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all doctors?

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.30">Are all workers of miracles?  Have all the grace of healing?
Do all speak with tongues?  Do all interpret?

</p>
               <p n="N7.12.31">But be zealous for the better gifts.  And I shew unto you yet
a more excellent way.

charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

</p>
               <p n="N7.13.2">And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries,
and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I
could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

               <p n="N7.13.3">And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and
if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity,
it profiteth me nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N7.13.4">Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not
perversely; is not puffed up;

</p>
               <p n="N7.13.5">Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to
anger, thinketh no evil;

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N7.13.7">Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
endureth all things.

</p>
               <p n="N7.13.8">Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made
void, or tongues shall cease, or knowledge shall be destroyed.

</p>
               <p n="N7.13.9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

</p>
               <p n="N7.13.10">But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part
shall be done away.

</p>

away the things of a child.

but the greatest of these is charity.

rather that you may prophesy.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.2">For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but
unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh
mysteries.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.3">But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.4">He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that
prophesieth, edifieth the church.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.5">And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to
prophesy.  For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that
speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the
church may receive edification.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.6">But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what
shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation,
or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.7">Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp,
except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known
what is piped or harped ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.8">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
himself to the battle ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.9">So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech,
how shall it be known what is said ?  For you shall be speaking
into the air.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.10">There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this
world; and none is without voice.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.11">If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him
to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that speaketh, a barbarian to
me.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.12">So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to
abound unto the edifying of the church.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.13">And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that
he may interpret.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
understanding is without fruit.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.15">What is it then ?  I will pray with the spirit, I will pray
also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will
sing also with the understanding.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.16">Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing ?
because he knoweth not what thou sayest.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.17">For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not
edified.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.18">I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.19">But in the church I had rather speak five words with my
understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand
words in a tongue.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.20">Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be
children, and in sense be perfect.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.21">In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I
will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me,
saith the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.22">Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to
unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.23">If therefore the whole church come together into one place,
and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons
or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.24">But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not,
or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all, he is judged of
all.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.25">The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling
down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among
you indeed.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.26">How is it then, brethren ?  When you come together, every one
of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a
tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to
edification.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.27">If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most
by three, and in course, and let one interpret.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.28">But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the
church, and speak to himself and to God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.29">And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest
judge.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.30">But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first
hold his peace.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.31">For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn, and
all may be exhorted:

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.32">And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.33">For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I
teach in all the churches of the saints.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.34">Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law
saith.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.35">But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands
at home.  For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.36">Or did the word of God come out from you ?  Or came it only
unto you ?

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.37">If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the
things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the
Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.38">But if any man know not, he shall not be known.

</p>
               <p n="N7.14.39">Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to
speak with tongues.

to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;

               <p n="N7.15.2">By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner
I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.3">For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that
Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.4">And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day,
according to the scriptures:

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.6">Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of
whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.7">After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.8">And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due
time.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.9">For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called
an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.10">But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace in me hath
not been void, but I have laboured more abundantly than all they:
yet not I, but the grace of God with me.

do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.13">But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not
risen again.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.14">And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and
your faith is also vain.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.15">Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God:  because we have
given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he
hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.16">For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.

               <p n="N7.15.17">And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are
yet in your sins.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.18">Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.22">And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.23">But every one in his own order: the firstfruits Christ, then they
that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.

</p>

God and the Father, when he shall have brought to nought all
principality, and power, and virtue.

things under his feet.  And whereas he saith,

               <p n="N7.15.31">I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in
Christ Jesus our Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.32">If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth
it profit me, if the dead rise not again?  Let us eat and drink, for
to morrow we shall die.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.33">Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.34">Awake, ye just, and sin not.  For some have not the knowledge of
God, I speak it to your shame.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.35">But some man will say: How do the dead rise again?  or with what
manner of body shall they come?

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.36">Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except
it die first.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.37">And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be;
but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.38">But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper
body.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men,
another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.40">And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but, one
is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.41">One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and
another the glory of the stars.  For star differeth from star in
glory.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.42">So also is the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown in corruption,
it shall rise in incorruption.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.43">It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory.  It is sown in
weakness, it shall rise in power.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.44">It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body.
If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual
body, as it is written:

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.45">The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into
a quickening spirit.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.46">Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural;
afterwards that which is spiritual.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.47">The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from
heaven, heavenly.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.48">Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is
the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.49">Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear
also the image of the heavenly.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.50">Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess
the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.51">Behold, I tell you a mystery.  We shall all indeed rise again:
but we shall not all be changed.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.52">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet:
for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise again
incorruptible: and we shall be changed.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal
must put on immortality.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.54">And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come
to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.55">O death, where is thy victory?  O death, where is thy sting?

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.56">Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.57">But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N7.15.58">Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable;
always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour
is not in vain in the Lord.

I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.2">On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with

that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.

               <p n="N7.16.7">For I will not see you now by the way, for I trust that I shall
abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.9">For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many
adversaries.

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.10">Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear,

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.11">Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct ye him on his way
in peace: that he may come to me.  For I look for him with the

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.12">And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand,
that I much entreated him to come unto you with the breatheren:
and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time.  But
he will come when he shall have leisure.

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.13">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith,do manfully, and be
strengthened.

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.15">And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanas,
and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of
Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.16">That you also be subject to such, and to every one that
worketh with us, and laboureth.

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.17">And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus,

have supplied.

</p>
               <p n="N7.16.18">For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours.  Know them,
therefore, that are such.

</p>

you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with
whom I also lodge.

               <head>Chapter 1</head>
               <p n="N8.1.1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our
brother:  to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that
are in all Achaia:

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.2">Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus
Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
mercies, and the God of all comfort.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.4">Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to
comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also
are exhorted by God.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us:  so also by Christ doth
our comfort abound.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.6">Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and
salvation:  or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation:  or
whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which
worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.7">That our hope for you may be steadfast:  knowing that as you are partakers
of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.8">For we would not have you ignorant,brethren, of our tribulation,
which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our
strength, so that we were weary even of life.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.9">But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust
in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.10">Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers:  in whom
we trust that he will yet also deliver us.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.11">You helping withal in prayer for us:  that for this gift obtained for
us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our
behalf.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.12">For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in
the grace of God, we have conversed in this world:  and more abundantly
towards you.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.13">For we write no other things to you than what you have read and
known.  And I hope that you shall know unto the end:

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.14">As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you
also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.15">And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you
might have a second grace:

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.16">And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to
you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.17">Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness?  Or, the things
that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be
with me, It is, and It is not?

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.18">But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It
is, and It is not.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by
me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is,
was in him.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.20">For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him,
amen to God, unto our glory.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.21">Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed
us, is God:

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.22">Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our
hearts.

</p>
               <p n="N8.1.23">But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not
any more to Corinth:  not because we exercise dominion over your faith:  but
we are helpers of your joy:  for in faith you stand.

               <p n="N8.2.1">But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.2">For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad,
but the same who is made sorrowful by me?

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.3">And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I come, have
sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to rejoice:  having
confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with
many tears:  not that you should be made sorrowful:  but that you might
know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.5">And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me; but in
part, that I may not burden you all.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.6">To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given
by many:

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.7">So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.8">Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your charity towards
him.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.9">For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of
you, whether you be obedient in all things.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.10">And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also.  For, what I have
pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in
the person of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.11">That we be not overreached by Satan.  For we are not ignorant of his
devices.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.12">And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was
opened unto me in the Lord,

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but
bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.14">Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ
Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.15">For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved,
and in them that perish.

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.16">To the one indeed the odour of death unto death:  but to the others
the odour of life unto life.  And for these things who is so sufficient?

</p>
               <p n="N8.2.17">For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with
sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.

               <p n="N8.3.1">Do we begin again to commend ourselves?  Or do we need (as some do)
epistles of commendation to you, or from you?

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.2">You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read
by all men:

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.3">Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by
us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not
in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.4">And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.5">Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of
ourselves:  but our sufficiency is from God.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.6">Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the
letter, but in the spirit.  For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.7">Now if the ministration  of death, engraven with letters upon stones,
was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold
the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void:

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.8">How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.9">For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the
ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.10">For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by
reason of the glory that excelleth.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.11">For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
remaineth is in glory.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.12">Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence:

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.13">And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of
Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.14">But their senses were made dull.  For, until this present day, the
selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken
away (because in Christ it is made void).

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.15">But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their
heart.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.16">But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken
away.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.17">Now the Lord is a Spirit.  And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty.

</p>
               <p n="N8.3.18">But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are
transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of
the Lord.

obtained mercy, we faint not;

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.2">But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the
truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of God.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.3">And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost,

</p>

that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of

your servants through Jesus.

</p>

shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of
God, in the face of Christ Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may
be of the power of God, and not of us.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.8">In all things we suffer tribulation, but are not distressed; we are
straitened, but are not destitute;

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.9">We suffer persecution, but are not forsaken; we are cast down, but we
perish not:

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.10">Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the
life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.11">For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake; that
the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.12">So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.13">But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written:  I believed,
for which cause I have spoken; we also believe, for which cause we speak
also:

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.14">Knowing that he who raised up Jesus, will raise us up also with

many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God.

corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.17">For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation,
worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.

</p>
               <p n="N8.4.18">While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen.  For the things which are seen, are temporal; but the
things which are not seen, are eternal.

               <p n="N8.5.1">For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved,
that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.2">For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our
habitation that is from heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.3">Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.4">For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened;
because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is
mortal may be swallowed up by life.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.5">Now he that maketh us for this very thing, is God, who hath given us
the pledge of the Spirit.

the body, and to be present with the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.9">And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.10">For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat of Christ,
that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he
hath done, whether it be good or evil.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.11">Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men; but
to God we are manifest.  And I trust also that in your consciences we are
manifest.

in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in
face, and not in heart.

</p>

sober, it is for you.

for all, then all were dead.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.15">And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not now live to
themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.16">Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh.  And if
we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now we know him so no

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.17">If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed
away, behold all things are made new.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.18">But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by
Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.19">For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not
imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us the word of
reconciliation.

</p>
               <p n="N8.5.20">For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by
us.  For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.

ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting

we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears within.

</p>
               <p n="N8.7.6">But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of
Titus.

</p>
               <p n="N8.7.7">And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation, wherewith he
was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal
for me, so that I rejoiced the more.

</p>
               <p n="N8.7.8">For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent; and
if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time)
did make you sorrowful;

</p>
               <p n="N8.7.9">Now I am glad:  not because you were made sorrowful; but because you
were made sorrowful unto penance.  For you were made sorrowful according to
God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N8.7.10">For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast
unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you; yea defence,
yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge:  in all
things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.

</p>
               <p n="N8.7.12">Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that I did
the wrong, nor for him that suffered it; but to manifest our carefulness
that we have for you

been given in the churches of Macedonia.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.2">That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of
joy; and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their
simplicity.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.3">For according to their power ( I bear them witness), and beyond their
power, they were willing.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.4">With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the
ministry that is done toward the saints.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.5">And not as we hoped, but they gave their own selves first to the
Lord, then to us by the will of God:

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.6">Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so also he would
finish among you this same grace.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.7">That as in all things you abound in faith, and word, and knowledge,
and all carefulness; moreover also in your charity towards us, so in this
grace also you may abound.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.8">I speak not as commanding; but by the carefulness of others,
approving also the good disposition of your charity.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he
became poor, for your sakes; that through his poverty you might be rich.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.10">And herein I give my advice; for this is profitable for you, who have
begun not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.11">Now therefore perform ye it also in deed; that as your mind is
forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you
have.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.12">For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a
man hath, not according to that which he hath not.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.13">For I mean not that others should be eased, and you burthened, but by
an equality.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.14">In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their
abundance also may supply your want, that there may be an equality,

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.15">As it is written:  He that had much, had nothing over; and he that had
little, had no want.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.16">And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in
the heart of Titus.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.17">For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more careful, of
his own will he went unto you.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.18">We have sent also with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel
through all the churches.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.19">And not that only, but he was also ordained by the churches companion
of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory
of the Lord, and our determined will:

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.20">Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which
is administered by us.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.21">For we forecast what may be good not only before God, but also before
men.

</p>
               <p n="N8.8.22">And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often
proved diligent in many things; but now much more diligent, with much
confidence in you,

Macedonians.  That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and your
emulation hath provoked very many.

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.3">Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of
concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you
may be ready:

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.4">Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find you
unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.

would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be
ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.6">Now this I say:  He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly:
and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings.

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.7">Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of
necessity:  for God loveth a cheerful giver.

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.8">And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always,
having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.9">As it is written:  He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the
poor:  his justice remaineth for ever.

</p>

to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits
of your justice:

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.11">That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all
simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.12">Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the
want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord,

</p>
               <p n="N8.9.13">By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of
your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the simplicity of your

when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.

</p>
               <p n="N8.10.12">For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some, that commend
themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves
with ourselves.

</p>
               <p n="N8.10.13">But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the
measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach
even unto you.

</p>

abundantly;

things we have been made manifest to you.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.7">Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself, that you might be exalted?
Because I preached unto you the gospel of God freely?

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.8">I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your
ministry.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.9">And, when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no
man:  for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from
Macedonia; and in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to
you, and so I will keep myself.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.10">The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken
off in me in the regions of Achaia.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.11">Wherefore?  Because I love you not?  God knoweth it.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.12">But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from
them that desire occasion, that wherein they glory, they may be found even
as we.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.13">For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming
themselves into the apostles of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.14">And no wonder:  for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel
of light.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.15">Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the
ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.16">I say again, (let no man think me to be foolish, otherwise take me as
one foolish, that I also may glory a little.)

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.17">That which I speak, I speak not according to God, but as it were in
foolishness, in this matter of glorying.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.18">Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.19">For you gladly suffer the foolish; whereas yourselves are wise.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.20">For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you,
if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you on the
face.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.21">I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part.
Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.22">They are Hebrews:  so am I.  They are Israelites:  so am I.  They are the
seed of Abraham:  so am I.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.23">They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise):  I am
more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above
measure, in deaths often.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.24">Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes, save one.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.25">Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered
shipwreck, a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.26">In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in
perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the
city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from
false brethren.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.27">In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst,
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.28">Besides those things which are without:  my daily instance, the
solicitude for all the churches.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.29">Who is weak, and I am not weak?  Who is scandalized, and I am not on
fire?

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.30">If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my
infirmity.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.31">The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever,
knoweth that I lie not.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.32">At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king,
guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me.

</p>
               <p n="N8.11.33">And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and so
escaped his hands.

visions and revelations of the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.2">I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body,
I know not, or out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one
caught up to the third heaven.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.3">And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I
know not:  God knoweth):

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.4">That he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret words, which it
is not granted to man to utter.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.5">For such an one I will glory; but for myself I will glory nothing, but
in my infirmities.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.6">For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish; for
I will say the truth.  But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above
that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.7">And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was
given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.8">For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from
me.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.9">And he said to me:  My grace is sufficient for thee; for power is made
perfect in infirmity.  Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities,
that the power of Christ may dwell in me.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.10">For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ.  For when I am
weak, then am I powerful.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.11">I am become foolish:  you have compelled me.  For I ought to have been
commended by you:  for I have no way come short of them that are above
measure apostles, although I be nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.12">Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all
patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.13">For what is there that you have had less than the other churches, but
that I myself was not burthensome to you?  Pardon me this injury.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.14">Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not
be burthensome unto you.  For I seek not the things that are yours, but
you.  For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the
parents for the children.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.15">But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls;
although loving you more, I be loved less.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.16">But be it so:  I did not burthen you:  but being crafty, I caught you
by guile.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.17">Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.18">I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother.  Did Titus overreach
you?  Did we not walk with the same spirit?  did we not in the same steps?

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.19">Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you?  We speak before
God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.20">For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I
would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not.  Lest
perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions,
whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.

</p>
               <p n="N8.12.21">Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you:  and I mourn many of
them that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness, and
fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed.

</p>
               <p n="N8.13.3">Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is
not weak, but is mighty in you?

</p>
               <p n="N8.13.4">For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the
power of God.  For we also are weak in him:  but we shall live with him by
the power of God towards you.

</p>
               <p n="N8.13.5">Try you own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye yourselves.  Know

</p>

approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as
reprobates.

</p>
               <p n="N8.13.8">For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.

</p>

pervert the gospel of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides
that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.9">As we said before, so now I say again:  If any one preach to you a
gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.10">For do I now persuade men, or God?  Or do I seek to please men?  If I
yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.11">For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was
preached by me is not according to man.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.12">For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the
revelation of Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.13">For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
religion:  how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and
wasted it.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.14">And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my
own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.15">But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, and
called me by his grace,

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles,
immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.

</p>

went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.

               <p n="N9.1.18">Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried
with him fifteen days.

</p>

Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.22">And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in
Christ:

</p>
               <p n="N9.1.23">But they had heard only:  He, who persecuted us in times past, doth

taking Titus also with me.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.2">And I went up according to revelation; and communicated to them the
gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart to them who seemed to be
some thing:  lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.3">But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to
be circumcised.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.4">But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately
to spy our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us
into servitude.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.5">To whom we yielded not by subjection, no not for an hour, that the truth
of the gospel might continue with you.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.6">But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time, it is
nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man,) for to me they that seemed
to be some thing added nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.7">But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel
of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.8">(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision,
wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.9">And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas
and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of
fellowship:  that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the
circumcision:

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.10">Only that we should be mindful of the poor:  which same thing also I was
careful to do.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.11">But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because
he was to be blamed.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.12">For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles:  but
when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were
of the circumcision.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.13">And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented, so that Barnabas
also was led by them into that dissimulation.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.14">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the
gospel, I said to Cephas before them all:  If thou, being a Jew, livest after
the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the
Gentiles to live as do the Jews?

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.15">We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gentiles sinners.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.16">But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the
faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be
justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law:  because by
the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.17">But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are
found sinners; is Christ then the minister of sin?  God forbid.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.18">For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself
a prevaricator.

</p>
               <p n="N9.2.19">For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God:  with
Christ I am nailed to the cross.

himself for me.

Jesus:  that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.15">Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man's testament, if it
be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.16">To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed.  He saith not, And to
his seeds, as of many:  but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.17">Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law
which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to
make the promise of no effect.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.18">For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise.  But God
gave it to Abraham by promise.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.19">Why then was the law?  It was set because of transgressions, until the
seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the
hand of a mediator.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.20">Now a mediator is not of one:  but God is one.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.21">Was the law then against the promises of God?  God forbid.  For if there
had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by
the law.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.22">But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the
faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.23">But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that
faith which was to be revealed.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.24">Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified
by faith.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.25">But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.26">For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.27">For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.28">There is neither Jew nor Greek:  there is neither bond nor free:  there
is neither male nor female.  For you are all one in Christ Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N9.3.29">And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according
to the promise.

               <p n="N9.4.1">Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a
servant, though he be lord of all;

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.3">So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the
world.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.4">But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a
woman, made under the law:

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.5">That he might redeem them who were under the law:  that we might receive
the adoption of sons.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.6">And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your
hearts, crying:  Abba, Father.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.7">Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son.  And if a son, an heir also
through God.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.8">But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are
not gods.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.9">But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God:  how
turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.10">You observe days, and months, and times, and years.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.11">I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.12">Be ye as I, because I also am as you:  brethren, I beseech you:  you have
not injured me at all.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.13">And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel
to you heretofore:  and your temptation in my flesh,

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.14">You despised not, nor rejected:  but received me as an angel of God, even
as Christ Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.15">Where is then your blessedness?  For I bear you witness, that, if it
could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given
them to me.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.16">Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

only when I am present with you.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.19">My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed
in you.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.20">And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice:
because I am ashamed for you.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.21">Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons:  the one by a bondwoman,
and the other by a free woman.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.23">But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh:  but he
of the free woman, was by promise.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.24">Which things are said by an allegory.  For these are the two testaments.
The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.25">For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem
which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.26">But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free:  which is our mother.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.27">For it is written:  Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not:  break forth
and cry, thou that travailest not:  for many are the children of the desolate,
more than of her that hath a husband.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.28">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.29">But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that
was after the spirit; so also it is now.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.30">But what saith the scripture?  Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for
the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.

</p>
               <p n="N9.4.31">So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the
free:  by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.

instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou

</p>
               <p n="N9.6.2">Bear ye one another's burdens; and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.

himself only, and not in another.

soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption.  But he that
soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.

</p>
               <p n="N9.6.9">And in doing good, let us not fail.  For in due time we shall reap, not

               <p n="N9.6.12">For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be
circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of
Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N9.6.13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the law; but they
will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

</p>
               <p n="N9.6.14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.

               <p n="N10.5.22">Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.23">Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church.  He is the saviour of his body.

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.24">Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.25">Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.26">That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.28">So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.  He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.29">For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.30">Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.32">This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.

</p>
               <p n="N10.5.33">Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as
himself:  and let the wife fear her husband.

               <p n="N11.1.22">And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and
what I shall choose I know not.

</p>
               <p n="N11.1.23">But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved
and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.

</p>
               <p n="N11.1.24">But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.

</p>
               <p n="N11.1.25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue
with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:

</p>
               <p n="N11.1.26">That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming
to you again.

</p>
               <p n="N11.1.27">Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that,
whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that
you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for
the faith of the gospel.

</p>
               <p n="N11.1.28">And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them
is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from
God:

</p>
               <p n="N11.1.29">For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him,
but also to suffer for him.

of the cross.

</p>
               <p n="N11.2.9">For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a

               <p n="N11.2.13">For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish,

and he that hath ministered to my wants.

</p>
               <p n="N11.2.26">For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had
heard that he was sick.

</p>
               <p n="N11.2.27">For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him;
and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon
sorrow.

</p>
               <p n="N11.2.28">Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you
may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.

</p>
               <p n="N11.2.29">Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with
honour such as he is.

</p>
               <p n="N11.2.30">Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death:
delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part
was wanting towards my service.

loss of all things, and count them but as dung, that I may gain
Christ:

</p>
               <p n="N11.3.9">And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the

myself to those that are before,

               <p n="N12.2.14">Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which
was contrary to us.  And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to
the cross:

</p>
               <p n="N12.2.15">And despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them
confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.

</p>

festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths,

               <p n="N12.2.17">Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N12.2.18">Let no man seduce you, willing in humility, and religion of angels,
walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense
of his flesh,

</p>
               <p n="N12.2.19">And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and
bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto the
increase of God.

</p>
               <p n="N12.2.20">If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do
you yet decree as though living in the world?

</p>
               <p n="N12.2.21">Touch not, taste not, handle not:

</p>
               <p n="N12.2.22">Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the
precepts and doctrines of men.

</p>
               <p n="N12.2.23">Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and
humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the
flesh.

               <p n="N13.2.2">But having suffered many things before, and been shamefully treated (as

but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish
her children:

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.8">So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel
of God, but also our own souls:  because you were become most dear unto us.

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.9">For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil:  working night and day,

hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.13">Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing:  because, that
when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it
not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in
you that have believed.

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.14">For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are
in Judea, in Christ Jesus:  for you also have suffered the same things from
your own coutrymen, even as they have from the Jews,

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.15">Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted
us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.16">Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill
up their sins always:  for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.17">But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight,
not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great
desire.

</p>
               <p n="N13.2.18">For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again:  but
Satan hath hindered us.

tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and you know.

because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you

</p>
               <p n="N15.5.4">But if any widow have children, or grandchildren, let her learn first to
govern her own house, and to make a return of duty to her parents: for this is
acceptable before God.

</p>
               <p n="N15.5.5">But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God, and
continue in supplications and prayers night and day.

</p>

been the wife of one husband.

</p>

she have received to harbour, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have
ministered to them that suffer tribulation, if she have diligently followed
every good work.

</p>
               <p n="N15.5.11">But the younger widows avoid.  For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they
will marry:

               <p n="N15.5.12">Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.

</p>
               <p n="N15.5.13">And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are
not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which they
ought not.

</p>
               <p n="N15.5.14">I will therefore that the younger should marry, bear children, be
mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.

</p>
               <p n="N16.4.17">But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching
may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear:  and I was delivered
out of the mouth of the lion.

</p>
               <p n="N16.4.18">The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work:  and will preserve me
unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

according to godliness:

from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Savior.

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.5">For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the
things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also
appointed thee:

               <p n="N17.1.6">If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful
children, not accused of riot, or unruly.

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.7">For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not
subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.8">But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.9">Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may
be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.10">For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers:
especially they who are of the circumcision:

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.11">Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which
they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.12">One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars,
evil beasts, slothful bellies.

</p>
               <p n="N17.1.13">This testimony is true.  Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be

               <p n="N18.1.8">Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee
that which is to the purpose:

</p>
               <p n="N18.1.9">For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul

the fathers by the prophets, last of all,

</p>
               <p n="N19.1.2">In these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of
all things, by whom also he made the world.

</p>
               <p n="N19.1.3">Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance,
and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins,
sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high.

</p>
               <p n="N19.1.4">Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more
excellent name than they.

to day have I begotten thee?  And again, I will be to him a Father, and he
shall be to me a Son?

</p>
               <p n="N19.1.6">And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he
saith:  And let all the angels of God adore him.

</p>
               <p n="N19.1.7">And to the angels indeed he saith:  He that maketh his angels spirits, and
his ministers a flame of fire.

</p>
               <p n="N19.1.8">But to the Son:  Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:  a sceptre of
justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

</p>
               <p n="N19.1.9">Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity:  therefore God, thy God, hath

thou art the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.6">But one in a certain place hath testified, saying:  What is man, that thou
art mindful of him:  or the son of man, that thou visitest him?

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.7">Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels:  thou hast crowned him

               <p n="N19.2.8">Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.  For in that he hath
subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him.  But now
we see not as yet all things subject to him.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.9">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the
suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour:  that, through the grace
of God, he might taste death for all.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.10">For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their
salvation, by his passion.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.11">For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of
one.  For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.12">I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the church will I
praise thee.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.13">And again:  I will put my trust in him.  And again:  Behold I and my
children, whom God hath given me.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.14">Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also
himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same:  that, through death,
he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the
devil:

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.15">And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to servitude.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.16">For no where doth he take hold of the angels:  but of the seed of Abraham
he taketh hold.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.17">Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren,
that he might become a merciful and faithful priest before God, that he
might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.

</p>
               <p n="N19.2.18">For in that, wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted, he is
able to succour them also that are tempted.

apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:

</p>

</p>

he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the house.

God.

in the desert,

</p>

               <p n="N19.3.10">Forty years:  for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I
said:  They always err in heart.  And they have not known my ways,

unbelief, to depart from the living God.

</p>
               <p n="N19.3.13">But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of
you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

</p>
               <p n="N19.3.14">For we are made partakers of Christ:  yet so, if we hold the beginning of
his substance firm unto the end.

</p>
               <p n="N19.3.15">While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your
hearts, as in that provocation.

</p>
               <p n="N19.3.16">For some who heard did provoke:  but not all that came out of Egypt by
Moses.

</p>
               <p n="N19.3.17">And with whom was he offended forty years?  Was it not with them that
sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?

</p>
               <p n="N19.3.18">And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest:  but
to them that were incredulous?

</p>
               <p n="N19.3.19">And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.

               <p n="N19.4.1">Let us fear therefore lest the promise being left of entering into his
rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.2">For unto us also it hath been declared, in like manner as unto them.  But
the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of
those things they heard.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.3">For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said:  As I have
sworn in my wrath; If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when
the works from the foundation of the world were finished.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.4">For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus:  And God rested
the seventh day from all his works.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.5">And in this place again:  If they shall enter into my rest.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.6">Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they, to whom
it was first preached, did not enter because of unbelief:

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.7">Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a
time, as it is above said:  To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not
your hearts.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.8">For if Jesus had given them rest, he would never have afterwards spoken
of another day.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.9">There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.10">For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his
works, as God did from his.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.11">Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest; lest any man fall into
the same example of unbelief.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.12">For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any
two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit,
of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.13">Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight:  but all things are
naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.14">Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens,
Jesus the Son of God:  let us hold fast our confession.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.15">For we have not a high priest, who can not have compassion on our
infirmities:  but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.

</p>
               <p n="N19.4.16">Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace:  that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.

               <p n="N19.5.1">For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the
things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices
for sins:

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.2">Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err:  because
he himself also is compassed with infirmity.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.3">And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer
for sins.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.4">Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called
by God, as Aaron was.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.5">So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high
priest:  but he that said unto him:  Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.6">As he saith also in another place:  Thou art a priest for ever, according
to the order of Melchisedech.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.7">Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up
prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was
heard for his reverence.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.8">And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the
things which he suffered:

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.9">And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of
eternal salvation.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.10">Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.11">Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered:  because
you are become weak to hear.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.12">For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be
taught again what are the first elements of the words of God:  and you are
become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.13">For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word of
justice:  for he is a little child.

</p>
               <p n="N19.5.14">But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have their
senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.

things more perfect, not laying again the foundation of penance from dead
works, and of faith towards God,

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and imposition of hands, and of the
resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.4">For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also
the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,

themselves the Son of God, and making him a mockery.

               <p n="N19.6.7">For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it, and
bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth
blessing from God.

</p>

near unto a curse, whose end is to be burnt.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.9">But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to
salvation; though we speak thus.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.10">For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love
which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister
to the saints.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.11">And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the
accomplishing of hope unto the end:

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.12">That you become not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and
patience shall inherit the promises.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.13">For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom
he might swear, swore by himself,

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.14">Saying:  Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall
multiply thee.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.15">And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.16">For men swear by one greater than themselves:  and an oath for
confirmation is the end of all their controversy.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.17">Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise
the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.18">That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we
may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the
hope set before us.

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.19">Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth
in even within the veil;

</p>
               <p n="N19.6.20">Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever
according to the order of Melchisedech.

               <head>Chapter 7</head>
               <p n="N19.7.1">For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who
met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him:

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.2">To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all:  who first indeed by
interpretation, is king of justice:  and then also king of Salem, that is,
king of peace:

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.3">Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither
beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God,
continueth a priest for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.4">Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch
gave tithes out of the principal things.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.5">And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood,
have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that
is to say, of their brethren:  though they themselves also came out of the
loins of Abraham.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.6">But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of
Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.7">And without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the
better.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.8">And here indeed, men that die, receive thithes:  but there he hath
witness, that he liveth.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.9">And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes, paid tithes in
Abraham:

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedech met him.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.11">If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the
people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest
should rise according to the order of Melchisedech, and not be called
according to the order of Aaron?

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.12">For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation
also be made of the law.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.13">For he, of whom these things are spoken, is of another tribe, of which no
one attended on the altar.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.14">For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda:  in which tribe Moses
spoke nothing concerning priests.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.15">And it is yet far more evident:  if according to the similitude of
Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.16">Who is made not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but
according to the power of an indissoluble life:

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.17">For he testifieth:  Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order
of Melchisedech.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.18">There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the
weakness and unprofitableness thereof:

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.19">(For the law brought nothing to perfection,) but a bringing in of a
better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.20">And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were
made priests without an oath;

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.21">But this with an oath, by him that said unto him:  The Lord hath sworn,
and he will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever.)

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.22">By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.23">And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death
they were not suffered to continue:

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.24">But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood,

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.25">Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him;
always living to make intercession for us.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.26">For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent,
undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.27">Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices first for
his own sins, and then for the people's:  for this he did once, in offering
himself.

</p>
               <p n="N19.7.28">For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity:  but the word of the
oath, which was since the law, the Son who is perfected for evermore.

               <p n="N19.8.1">Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum:  We have such an
high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in
the heavens,

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.2">A minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath
pitched, and not man.

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.3">For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices:
wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.4">If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest:  seeing that there
would be others to offer gifts according to the law,

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.5">Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things.  As it was
answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle:  See (saith he)
that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee
on the mount.

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.6">But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a
mediator of a better testament, which is established on better promises.

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.7">For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place
have been sought for a second.

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.8">For finding fault with them, he saith:  Behold, the days shall come, saith
the Lord:  and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house
of Juda, a new testament:

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.9">Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day
when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt:
because they continued not in my testament:  and I regarded them not, saith
the Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.10">For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after
those days, saith the Lord:  I will give my laws into their mind, and in
their heart will I write them:  and I will be their God, and they shall
be my people:

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.11">And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his
brother, saying, Know the Lord:  for all shall know me from the least to the
greatest of them:

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.12">Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will
remember no more.

</p>
               <p n="N19.8.13">Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old.  And that which decayeth
and groweth old, is near its end.

               <head>Chapter 9</head>
               <p n="N19.9.1">The former indeed had also justifications of divine service, and a worldly
sanctuary.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.2">For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks,
and the table, and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the holy.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.3">And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holy of
holies:

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.4">Having a golden censer, and the ark of the testament covered about on
every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna, and the
rod of Aaron, that had blossomed, and the tables of the testament.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.5">And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory:
of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.6">Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests
indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.7">But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year:  not without
blood, which he offereth for his own, and the people's ignorance:

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.8">The Holy Ghost signifying this, that the way into the holies was not yet
made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.9">Which is a parable of the time present:  according to which gifts and
sacrifices are offered, which can not, as to the conscience, make him
perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.10">And divers washings, and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time
of correction.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.11">But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a
greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of
this creation:

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.12">Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered
once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.13">For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer
being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the
flesh:

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered
himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to
serve the living God?

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.15">And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament:  that by means of
his death, for the redemption of those trangressions, which were under
the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of
eternal inheritance.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.16">For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must of
necessity come in.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.17">For a testament is of force, after men are dead:  otherwise it is as yet
of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.18">Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.19">For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the
people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool
and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.20">Saying:  This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined
unto you.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.21">The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner,
he sprinkled with blood.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.22">And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood:
and without shedding of blood there is no remission.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.23">It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be
cleansed with these:  but the heavenly things themselves with better
sacrifices than these.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.24">For Jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands, the patterns
of the true:  but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the
presence of God for us.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.25">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth
into the holies, every year with the blood of others:

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.26">For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the
world:  but now once at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction
of sin, by the sacrifice of himself.

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.27">And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:

</p>
               <p n="N19.9.28">So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; the second
time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.

               <p n="N19.10.1">For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very
image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer
continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect:

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.2">For then they would have ceased to be offered:  because the worshippers
once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer:

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.3">But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.4">For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should
be taken away.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.5">Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith:  Sacrifice and oblation
thou wouldest not:  but a body thou hast fitted to me:

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.6">Holocausts for sin did not please thee.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.7">Then said I:  Behold I come:  in the head of the book it is written of
me:  that I should do thy will, O God.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.8">In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou
wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered
according to the law.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.9">Then said I:  Behold, I come to do thy will, O God:  he taketh away the
first, that he may establish that which followeth.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.10">In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus
Christ once.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.11">And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.12">But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the
right hand of God,

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.13">From henceforth expecting, until his enemies be made his footstool.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.14">For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.15">And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us.  For after that he said:

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.16">And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days,
saith the Lord.  I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds
will I write them:

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.17">And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.18">Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation
for sin.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.19">Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies
by the blood of Christ;

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.20">A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that
is to say, his flesh,

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.21">And a high priest over the house of God:

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.22">Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean
water.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.23">Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is
faithful that hath promised),

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.24">And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good
works:

another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.26">For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is
now left no sacrifice for sins,

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.27">But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire
which shall consume the adversaries.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.28">A man making void the law of Moses, dieth without any mercy under two
or three witnesses:

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.29">How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath
trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the
testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront
to the Spirit of grace?

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.30">For we know him that hath said:  Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will
repay.  And again:  The Lord shall judge his people.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.32">But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured
a great fight of afflictions.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.33">And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a
gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used
in such sort.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.34">For you both had compassion on them that were in bands, and took with joy
the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a
lasting substance.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.35">Do not therefore lose your confidence, which hath a great reward.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.36">For patience is necessary for you; that, doing the will of God, you may
receive the promise.

</p>
               <p n="N19.10.37">For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come, will
come, and will not delay.

</p>

please my soul.

</p>

things that appear not.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.2">For by this the ancients obtained a testimony.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.3">By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God; that
from invisible things visible things might be made.

</p>

he obtained a testimony that he was just, God giving testimony to his

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.5">By faith Henoch was translated, that he should not see death; and he was
not found, because God had translated him:  for before his translation he
had testimony that he pleased God.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.6">But without faith it is impossible to please God.  For he that cometh to
God, must believe that he is, and is a rewarder to them that seek him.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.7">By faith Noe, having received an answer concerning those things which
as yet were not seen, moved with fear, framed the ark for the saving of
his house, by the which he condemned the world; and was instituted heir of
the justice which is by faith.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.8">By faith he that is called Abraham, obeyed to go out into a place which
he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing
whither he went.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.9">By faith he abode in the land, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob,
the co-heirs of the same promise.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.10">For he looked for a city that hath foundations; whose builder and maker
is God.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.11">By faith also Sara herself, being barren, received strength to conceive
seed, even past the time of age; because she believed that he was
faithful who had promised,

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.12">For which cause there sprung even from one (and him as good as dead) as
the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea
shore innumerable.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.13">All these died according to faith, not having received the promises, but
beholding them afar off, and saluting them, and confessing that they are
pilgrims and strangers on the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.14">For they that say these things, do signify that they seek a country.

had doubtless time to return.

</p>

Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared
for them a city.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.17">By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered Isaac:  and he that had

because they saw he was a comely babe, and they feared not the king's
edict.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.24">By faith Moses, when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of
Pharao's daughter;

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.25">Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have the

Egyptians.  For he looked unto the reward.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.27">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the fierceness of the king:  for he
endured as seeing him that is invisible.

</p>
               <p n="N19.11.28">By faith he celebrated the pasch, and the shedding of the blood; that he,

stopped the mouths of lions,

</p>
               <p n="N19.12.6">For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth; and he scourgeth every son whom
he receiveth.

</p>

what son is there, whom the father doth not correct?

</p>
               <p n="N19.12.8">But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are made partakers, then
are you bastards, and not sons.

</p>
               <p n="N19.12.9">Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh, for instructors, and we

</p>
               <p n="N19.12.11">Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it
joy, but sorrow:  but afterwards it will yield, to them that are exercised
by it, the most peaceable fruit of justice.

</p>
               <p n="N19.12.12">Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,

</p>
               <p n="N19.12.13">And make straight steps with your feet:  that no one, halting, may go out

</p>
               <p n="N19.13.16">And do not forget to do good, and to impart; for by such sacrifices God's
favour is obtained.

</p>
               <p n="N19.13.17">Obey your prelates, and be subject to them.  For they watch as being to

with grief.  For this is not expedient for you.

</p>
               <p n="N19.13.18">Pray for us.  For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to

tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.2">My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers
temptations;

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.3">Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.4">And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire,
failing in nothing.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.5">But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men
abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.6">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.  For he that wavereth is like
a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.7">Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
Lord.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.8">A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.9">But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.10">And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass
shall he pass away.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.11">For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the
flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished:  so
also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.12">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been
proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them
that love him.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.13">Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God.  For God
is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.14">But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and
allured.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.15">Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.  But sin,
when it is completed, begetteth death.

the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.

</p>

slow to speak, and slow to anger.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.20">For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.21">Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness,
with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.22">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
selves.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.23">For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be

</p>

continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work;
this man shall be blessed in his deed.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.26">And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue,
but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain.

</p>
               <p n="N20.1.27">Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this:  to
visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation:  and to keep one's self
unspotted from this world.

respect of persons.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.2">For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring,
in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.3">And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and
shall say to him:  Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man:  Stand thou
there, or sit under my footstool:

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.4">Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust
thoughts?

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.5">Hearken, my dearest brethren:  hath not God chosen the poor in this
world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them
that love him?

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.6">But you have dishonoured the poor man.  Do not the rich oppress you by
might?  and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.7">Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.8">If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.9">But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by
the law as transgressors.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.10">And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is
become guilty of all.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.11">For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt
not kill.  Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become
a transgressor of the law.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.12">So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.13">For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy.  And mercy
exalteth itself above judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.14">What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath
not works?  Shall faith be able to save him?

               <p n="N20.2.15">And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:

give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it
profit?

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.17">So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.18">But some man will say:  Thou hast faith, and I have works:  shew me thy
faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.19">Thou believest that there is one God.  Thou dost well:  the devils also
believe and tremble.

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son
upon the altar?

</p>

was made perfect?

</p>
               <p n="N20.2.23">And the scripture was fulfilled, saying:  Abraham believed God, and it
was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.

works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?

works is dead.

among our members, which defileth the whole body, and inflameth the wheel of
our nativity, being set on fire by hell.

</p>

               <p n="N21.1.1">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through
Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect,

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.2">According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the sanctification
of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ:
Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according
to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection
of Jesus Christ from the dead,

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.4">Unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that can not fade,
reserved in heaven for you,

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.5">Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be
revealed in the last time.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.6">Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time
made sorrowful in divers temptations:

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.7">That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried
by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of
Jesus Christ:

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.8">Whom having not seen, you love:  in whom also now, though you see him
not, you believe:  and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and
glorified;

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.9">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.10">Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched,
who prophesied of the grace to come in you.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.11">Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did
signify:  when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ, and the glories
that should follow:

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.12">To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you they
ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have
preached the gospel to you, the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven, on
whom the angels desire to look.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.13">Wherefore having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober, trust
perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.14">As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former desires
of your ignorance:

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.15">But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you also in
all manner of conversation holy:

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.16">Because it is written:  You shall be holy, for I am holy.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.17">And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons, judgeth
according to every one's work:  converse in fear during the time of your
sojourning here.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.18">Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or
silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers:

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.19">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and
undefiled,

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.20">Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in
the last times for you,

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.21">Who through him are faithful in God, who raised him up from the dead, and
hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.22">Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a brotherly love,
from a sincere heart love one another earnestly:

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.23">Being born again not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by the word
of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.24">For all flesh is as grass; and all the glory thereof as the flower of
grass.  The grass is withered, and the flower thereof is fallen away.

</p>
               <p n="N21.1.25">But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.  And this is the word which by
the gospel hath been preached unto you.

envies, and all detractions,

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.2">As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.4">Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen
and made honourable by God:

Christ.

confounded.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.7">To you therefore that believe, he is honour:  but to them that believe not,
the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.8">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at
the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.9">But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a
purchased people:  that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out
of darkness into his marvellous light:

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.10">Who in time past were not a people:  but are now the people of God.  Who
had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.11">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain
yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.12">Having your conversation good among the Gentiles:  that whereas they speak
against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold
in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.13">Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God's sake:  whether
it be to the king as excelling;

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.14">Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for
the praise of the good:

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.15">For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the
ignorance of foolish men:

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.16">As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants
of God.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.17">Honour all men.  Love the brotherhood.  Fear God.  Honour the king.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.18">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good
and gentle, but also to the froward.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.19">For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure
sorrows, suffering wrongfully.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.20">For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you
endure?  But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before
God.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.21">For unto this are you called:  because Christ also suffered for us,
leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.22">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.23">Who, when he was reviled, did not revile:  when he suffered, he threatened

dead to sins, should live to justice:  by whose stripes you were healed.

</p>
               <p n="N21.2.25">For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the

believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of
the wives.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.2">Considering your chaste conversation with fear.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.3">Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the
wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:

meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.5">For after this manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted in God,
adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.6">As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord:  whose daughters you are, doing
well, and not fearing any disturbance.

</p>

honour to the female as to the weaker vessel, and as to the co-heirs of the
grace of life:  that your prayers be not hindered.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.8">And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.9">Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise,
blessing:  for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.

</p>

from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.11">Let him decline from evil, and do good:  let him seek after peace and
pursue it:

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.12">Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their
prayers:  but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.13">And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?

</p>

be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled.

speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good
conversation in Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.17">For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than
doing ill.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.18">Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust:
that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but
enlivened in the spirit,

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.19">In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.20">Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience
of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building:  wherein a few, that
is, eight souls, were saved by water.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.21">Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also:  not the
putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good
conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

</p>
               <p n="N21.3.22">Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death, that we might be

and virtues being made subject to him.

same thought:  for he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sins:

</p>
               <p n="N21.4.2">That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh , not after the
desires of men, but according to the will of God.

</p>
               <p n="N21.4.3">For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the
Gentiles, for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of wine,
revellings, banquetings, and unlawful worshipping of idols.

</p>
               <p n="N21.4.4">Wherein they think it strange, that you run not with them into the same
confusion of riotousness, speaking evil of you.

to God, in the Spirit.

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N21.4.8">But before all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves:
for charity covereth a multitude of sins.

</p>
               <p n="N21.4.9">Using hospitality one towards another, without murmuring,

good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

minister, let him do it, as of the power, which God administereth:  that in all
things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ:  to whom is glory and empire
for ever and ever.  Amen.

glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.

</p>
               <p n="N21.4.14">If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed:  for

Spirit, resteth upon you.

               <p n="N22.1.15">And I will endeavour, that you frequently have after my decease, whereby
you may keep a memory of these things.

</p>
               <p n="N22.1.16">For we have not by following artificial fables, made known to you the
power, and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ; but we were eyewitnesses of his
greatness.

</p>
               <p n="N22.1.17">For he received from God the Father, honour and glory:  this voice
coming down to him from the excellent glory:  This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

</p>
               <p n="N22.1.18">And this voice we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in
the holy mount.

</p>
               <p n="N22.1.19">And we have the more firm prophetical word:  whereunto you do well to
attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
day star arise in your hearts:

</p>
               <p n="N22.1.20">Understanding this first, that no prophecy of scripture is made by
private interpretation.

</p>
               <p n="N22.1.21">For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time:  but the holy men
of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost.

be among you lying teachers, who shall bring in sects of perdition, and deny
the Lord who bought them:  bringing upon themselves swift destruction.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.2">And many shall follow their riotousnesses, through whom the way of truth
shall be evil spoken of.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.3">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you.  Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and
their perdition slumbereth not.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.4">For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn
down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto
judgment:

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.5">And spared not the original world, but preserved Noe, the eighth person,
the preacher of justice, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.6">And reducing the cities of the Sodomites, and of the Gomorrhites, into
ashes, condemned them to be overthrown, making them an example to those that
should after act wickedly.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.7">And delivered just Lot, oppressed by the injustice and lewd conversation
of the wicked.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.8">For in sight and hearing he was just:  dwelling among them, who from day
to day vexed the just soul with unjust works.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.9">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation, but to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.10">And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,
and despise government, audacious, self willed, they fear not to bring in
sects, blaspheming.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.11">Whereas angels who are greater in strength and power, bring not against
themselves a railing judgment.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.12">But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and
to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not, shall perish in
their corruption,

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.13">Receiving the reward of their injustice, counting for a pleasure the
delights of a day:  stains and spots, sporting themselves to excess, rioting in
their feasts with you:

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.14">Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not:  alluring
unstable souls, having their heart exercised with covetousness, children of
malediction:

Balaam of Bosor, who loved the wages of iniquity,

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.16">But had a check of his madness, the dumb beast used to the yoke, which
speaking with man's voice, forbade the folly of the prophet.

               <p n="N22.2.17">These are fountains without water, and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to
whom the mist of darkness is reserved.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.18">For, speaking proud words of vanity, they allure by the desires of
fleshly riotousness, those who for a little while escape, such as converse in
error:

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.19">Promising them liberty, whereas they themselves are the slaves of
corruption.  For by whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the slave.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.20">For if, flying from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they be again entangled in them and
overcome:  their latter state is become unto them worse than the former.

</p>
               <p n="N22.2.21">For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice,
than after they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment
which was delivered to them.

</p>

stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind:

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.2">That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the
holy prophets, and of your apostles, of the precepts of the Lord and Saviour.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.3">Knowing this first, that in the last days there shall come deceitful
scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.4">Saying:  Where is his promise or his coming?  for since the time that the
fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.5">For this they are wilfully ignorant of, that the heavens were before, and
the earth out of water, and through water, consisting by the word of God.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.6">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.7">But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of the
ungodly men.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.8">But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day with the
Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.9">The Lord delayeth not his promise, as some imagine, but dealeth patiently
for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that all should return
to penance.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.10">But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief, in which the heavens
shall pass away with great violence, and the elements shall be melted with
heat, and the earth and the works which are in it, shall be burnt up.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.11">Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of
people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness?

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.12">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord, by
which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt
with the burning heat?

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.13">But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises,
in which justice dwelleth.

</p>

you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.15">And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation; as also our most
dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to you:

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.16">As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are
certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest,
as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.17">You therefore, brethren, knowing these things before, take heed, lest
being led aside by the error of the unwise, you fall from your own
steadfastness.

</p>
               <p n="N22.3.18">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.  To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity.  Amen.

But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just:

commandment which you had from the beginning.  The old commandment is the word
which you have heard.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.8">Again a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true both in him
and in you; because the darkness is passed, and the true light now shineth.

love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.16">For all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of the flesh, and the
concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father,
but is of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.17">And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof:  but he that
doth the will of God, abideth for ever.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.18">Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that
Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists:  whereby we
know that it is the last hour.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.19">They went out from us, but they were not of us.  For if they had been of
us, they would no doubt have remained with us; but that they may be manifest,
that they are not all of us.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.20">But you have the unction from the Holy One, and know all things.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.21">I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to

Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the Son.

shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.

               <p n="N23.2.27">And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him, abide
in you.  And you have no need that any man teach you; but as his unction
teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie.  And as it hath taught
you, abide in him.

</p>
               <p n="N23.2.28">And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may
have confidence, and not be confounded by him at his coming.

justice, is born of him.

               <p n="N23.4.6">We are of God.  He that knoweth God, heareth us.  He that is not of God,
heareth us not.  By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.7">Dearly beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God.  And every
one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.8">He that loveth not, knoweth not God:  for God is charity.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.9">By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath
sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.10">In this is charity:  not as though we had loved God, but because he hath
first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.11">My dearest, if God hath so loved us; we also ought to love one another.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.12">No man hath seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God abideth
in us, and his charity is perfected in us.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.13">In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us:  because he hath
given us of his spirit.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.14">And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent his Son to be
the Saviour of the world.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.15">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him,
and he in God.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.16">And we have known, and have believed the charity, which God hath to us.
God is charity:  and he that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in
him.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.17">In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have
confidence in the day of judgment:  because as he is, we also are in this
world.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.18">Fear is not in charity:  but perfect charity casteth out fear, because
fear hath pain.  And he that feareth, is not perfected in charity.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.19">Let us therefore love God, because God first hath loved us.

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.20">If any man say, I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar.  For
he that loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how can he love God, whom he
seeth not?

</p>
               <p n="N23.4.21">And this commandment we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also
his brother.

one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.2">In this we know that we love the children of God:  when we love God, and
keep his commandments.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.3">For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments:  and his
commandments are not heavy.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.4">For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world:  and this is the

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.6">This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ:  not by water
only, but by water and blood.  And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that
Christ is the truth.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.7">And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word,

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.8">And there are three that give testimony on earth:  the spirit, and the
water, and the blood:  and these three are one.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.9">If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater.  For
this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of

               <p n="N23.5.10">He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in

believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.11">And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life.  And
this life is in his Son.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.12">He that hath the Son, hath life.  He that hath not the Son, hath not life.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.13">These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life,
you who believe in the name of the Son of God.

the petitions which we request of him.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.16">He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him
ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death.  There is a sin
unto death:  for that I say not that any man ask.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.17">All iniquity is sin.  And there is a sin unto death.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.18">We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not:  but the generation
of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.19">We know that we are of God, and the whole world is seated in wickedness.

</p>
               <p n="N23.5.20">And we know that the Son of God is come:  and he hath given us
understanding that we may know the true God, and may be in his true Son.  This

</p>

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.5">Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen:  and do penance, and do
the first works.  Or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of
its place, except thou do penance.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.6">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites, which I

To him, that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in

blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue
of Satan.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.10">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.  Behold, the devil will
cast some of you into prison that you may be tried:  and you shall have
tribulation ten days.  Be thou faithful until death:  and I will give thee the
crown of life.

was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.14">But I have against thee a few things:  because thou hast there them that
hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before
the children of Israel, to eat, and to commit fornication:

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.15">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.16">In like manner do penance:  if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will
fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

To him that overcometh, I will give the hidden manna, and will give him a white

thy patience, and thy last works which are more than the former.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.20">But I have against thee a few things:  because thou sufferest the woman
Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach, and to seduce my servants,
to commit fornication, and to eat of things sacrificed to idols.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.21">And I gave her a time that she might do penance, and she will not repent
of her fornication.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.22">Behold, I will cast her into a bed:  and they that commit adultery with
her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do penance from their deeds.

</p>
               <p n="N27.2.23">And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know
that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one

they shall be broken,

</p>

observe, and do penance.  If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as
a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to thee.

</p>
               <p n="N27.3.4">But thou hast a few names in Sardis, which have not defiled their

hereafter.

               <p n="N27.4.2">And immediately I was in the spirit:  and behold there was a throne set in
heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.

crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four
living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.

</p>
               <p n="N27.4.7">And the first living creature was like a lion:  and the second living

the seven seals thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N27.5.6">And I saw:  and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living

having seven horns and seven eyes:  which are the seven Spirits of God, sent
forth into all the earth.

</p>

               <p n="N27.5.9">And they sung a new canticle, saying:  Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take
the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou wast slain, and hast
redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people,
and nation.

</p>
               <p n="N27.5.10">And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign on

a penny, and see thou hurt not the wine and the oil.

               <p n="N27.8.1">And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven, as
it were for half an hour.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.2">And I saw seven angels standing in the presence of God; and there were
given to them seven trumpets.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.3">And another angel came, and stood before the altar, having a golden
censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer of the
prayers of all saints upon the golden altar, which is before the throne of God.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.4">And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up
before God from the hand of the angel.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.5">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar,
and cast it on the earth, and there were thunders and voices and lightnings,
and a great earthquake.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.6">And the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to
sound the trumpet.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.7">And the first angel sounded the trumpet, and there followed hail and fire,
mingled with blood, and it was cast on the earth, and the third part of the
earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green
grass was burnt up.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.8">And the second angel sounded the trumpet:  and as it were a great
mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea, and the third part of the
sea became blood:

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.9">And the third part of those creatures died, which had life in the sea, and
the third part of the ships was destroyed.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.10">And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from
heaven, burning as it were a torch, and it fell on the third part of the
rivers, and upon the fountains of waters:

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.11">And the name of the star is called Wormwood.  And the third part of the
waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were
made bitter.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.12">And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third part of the sun
was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars,
so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day did not shine for a
third part of it, and the night in like manner.

</p>
               <p n="N27.8.13">And I beheld, and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the midst
of heaven, saying with a loud voice:  Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the
earth:  by reason of the rest of the voices of the three angels, who are yet to
sound the trumpet.

               <p n="N27.9.1">And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven
upon the earth, and there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.2">And he opened the bottomless pit:  and the smoke of the pit arose, as the
smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke
of the pit.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.3">And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth.  And
power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power:

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.4">And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the
earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree:  but only the men who have not the
sign of God on their foreheads.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.5">And it was given unto them that they should not kill them; but that they
should torment them five months:  and their torment was as the torment of a
scorpion when he striketh a man.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.6">And in those days men shall seek death, and shall not find it:  and they
shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.7">And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle:
and on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold:  and their faces were as
the faces of men.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.8">And they had hair as the hair of women;  and their teeth were as lions:

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.9">And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their
wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to battle.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.10">And they had tails like to scorpions, and there were stings in their
tails; and their power was to hurt men five months.  And they had over them

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.11">A king, the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon,
and in Greek Apollyon; in Latin Exterminans,

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.12">One woe is past, and behold there come yet two woes more hereafter.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.13">And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet:  and I heard a voice from the
four horns of the great altar, which is before the eyes of God,

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.14">Saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet:  Loose the four angels,
who are bound in the great river Euphrates.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.15">And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day,
and a month, and a year:  for to kill the third part of men.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.16">And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times ten
thousand.  And I heard the number of them.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.17">And thus I saw the horses in the vision:  and they that sat on them, had
breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone, and the heads of the
horses were as the heads of lions:  and from their mouths proceeded fire, and
smoke, and brimstone.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.18">And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by the fire
and by the smoke and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.19">For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails.  For,
their tails are like to serpents, and have heads:  and with them they hurt.

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.20">And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these plagues, did not do
penance from the works of their hands, that they should not adore devils, and
idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood, which neither can
see, nor hear, nor walk:

</p>
               <p n="N27.9.21">Neither did they penance from their murders, nor from their sorceries, nor
from their fornication, nor from their thefts.

cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as the sun, and his
feet as pillars of fire.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.2">And he had in his hand a little book open:  and he set his right foot upon
the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.3">And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth.  And when he had
cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.4">And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to
write:  and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me:  Seal up the things which
the seven thunders have spoken; and write them not.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.5">And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted
up his hand to heaven,

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.6">And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven,
and the things which are therein; and the earth, and the things which are in
it; and the sea, and the things which are therein:  That time shall be no
longer.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.7">But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to
sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared by
his servants the prophets.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.8">And I heard a voice from heaven again speaking to me, and saying:  Go, and
take the book that is open, from the hand of the angel who standeth upon the
sea, and upon the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.9">And I went to the angel, saying unto him, that he should give me the
book.  And he said to me:  Take the book, and eat it up:  and it shall make thy
belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.10">And I took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate it up:  and it was
in my mouth, sweet as honey:  and when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

</p>
               <p n="N27.10.11">And he said to me:  Thou must prophesy again to many nations, and peoples,

Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar and them that adore therein.

</p>
               <p n="N27.11.2">But the court, which is without the temple, cast out, and measure it not:

he be slain.

their bodies for three days and a half:  and they shall not suffer their bodies
to be laid in sepulchres.

</p>
               <p n="N27.11.10">And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make

tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N27.11.11">And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from God entered into
them.  And they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them that saw
them.

</p>
               <p n="N27.11.12">And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them:  Come up

thousand:  and the rest were cast into a fear, and gave glory to the God of
heaven.

having seven heads, and ten horns:  and on his head seven diadems:

</p>
               <p n="N27.12.4">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to

night.

</p>
               <p n="N27.12.11">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of the

</p>
               <p n="N27.12.15">And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman, water as it were a

               <p n="N27.14.4">These are they who were not defiled with women:  for they are virgins.
These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.  These were purchased from among
men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb:

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.5">And in their mouth there was found no lie; for they are without spot
before the throne of God.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.6">And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the
eternal gospel, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth, and over every
nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people:

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.7">Saying with a loud voice:  Fear the Lord, and give him honour, because the
hour of his judgment is come; and adore ye him, that made heaven and earth, the
sea, and the fountains of waters.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.8">And another angel followed, saying:  That great Babylon is fallen, is
fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.9">And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice:  If any man
shall adore the beast and his image, and receive his character in his forehead,
or in his hand;

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.10">He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mingled with
pure wine in the cup of his wrath, and shall be tormented with fire and
brimstone in the sight of the holy angels, and in the sight of the Lamb.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.11">And the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and ever:
neither have they rest day nor night, who have adored the beast, and his image,
and whoever receiveth the character of his name.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.12">Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and
the faith of Jesus.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.13">And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me:  Write:  Blessed are the
dead, who die in the Lord.  From henceforth now, saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labours; for their works follow them.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.14">And I saw, and behold a white cloud; and upon the cloud one sitting like
to the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp
sickle.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.15">And another angel came out from the temple crying with a loud voice to him
that sat upon the cloud:  Thrust in thy sickle, and reap, because the hour is
come to reap:  for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.16">And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth, and the
earth was reaped.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.17">And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also
having a sharp sickle.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.18">And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire; and he
cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying:  Thrust in
thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth; because
the grapes thereof are ripe.

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.19">And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth, and gathered the
vineyard of the earth, and cast it into the great press of the wrath of God:

</p>
               <p n="N27.14.20">And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the
press, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

               <p n="N27.15.1">And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful:  seven angels
having the seven last plagues.  For in them is filled up the wrath of God.

</p>
               <p n="N27.15.2">And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had
overcome the beast, and his image, and the number of his name, standing on the
sea of glass, having the harps of God:

</p>
               <p n="N27.15.3">And singing the canticle of Moses, the servant of God, and the canticle of
the Lamb, saying:  Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Almighty; just
and true are thy ways, O King of ages.

</p>
               <p n="N27.15.4">Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and magnify thy name?  For thou only art
holy:  for all nations shall come, and shall adore in thy sight, because thy
judgments are manifest.

</p>
               <p n="N27.15.5">And after these things I looked; and behold, the temple of the tabernacle
of the testimony in heaven was opened:

</p>
               <p n="N27.15.6">And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues,
clothed with clean and white linen, and girt about the breasts with golden
girdles.

</p>
               <p n="N27.15.7">And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden
vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.

</p>
               <p n="N27.15.8">And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God, and from

               <p n="N27.16.1">And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels:
Go, and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.2">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there fell
a sore and grievous wound upon men, who had the character of the beast; and
upon them that adored the image thereof.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.3">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and there came
blood as it were of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.4">And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the fountains of
waters; and there was made blood.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.5">And I heard the angel of the waters saying:  Thou art just, O Lord, who

true and just are thy judgments.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.8">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun, and it was given
unto him to afflict men with heat and fire:

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.9">And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of
God, who hath power over these plagues, neither did they penance to give him
glory.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.10">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and
his kingdom became dark, and they gnawed their tongues for pain:

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.11">And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and wounds,
and did not penance for their works.

Armagedon.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.18">And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and there was a great
earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon the earth, such
an earthquake, so great.

</p>
               <p n="N27.16.19">And the great city was divided into three parts; and the cities of the

               <p n="N27.17.1">And there came one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials, and spoke
with me, saying:  Come, I will shew thee the condemnation of the great harlot,
who sitteth upon many waters,

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.2">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication; and they who
inhabit the earth, have been made drunk with the whine of her whoredom.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.3">And he took me away in spirit into the desert.  And I saw a woman sitting
upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads
and ten horns.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.4">And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet, and gilt
with gold, and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand,
full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.5">And on her forehead a name was written:  A mystery; Babylon the great, the
mother of the fornications, and the abominations of the earth.

of the martyrs of Jesus.  And I wondered, when I had seen her, with great
admiration.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.7">And the angel said to me:  Why dost thou wonder?  I will tell thee the
mystery of the woman, and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath the
seven heads and ten horns.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.8">The beast, which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up out of
the bottomless pit, and go into destruction:  and the inhabitants on the earth
(whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the
world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was, and is not.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.9">And here is the understanding that hath wisdom.  The seven heads are seven
mountains, upon which the woman sitteth, and they are seven kings:

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.10">Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come:  and when he is
come, he must remain a short time.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.11">And the beast which was, and is not:  the same also is the eighth, and is
of the seven, and goeth into destruction.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.12">And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings, who have not yet
received a kingdom, but shall receive power as kings one hour after the beast.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.13">These have one design:  and their strength and power they shall deliver to
the beast.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.14">These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because
he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and they that are with him are called,
and elect, and faithful.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.15">And he said to me:  The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot
sitteth, are peoples, and nations, and tongues.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.16">And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast:  these shall hate the
harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and
shall burn her with fire.

</p>
               <p n="N27.17.17">For God hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth him:  that
they give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.

over the kings of the earth.

unclean spirit, and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird:

</p>
               <p n="N27.18.3">Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication; and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her;
and the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the power of her
delicacies.

</p>

according to her works:  in the cup wherein she hath mingled, mingle ye double
unto her.

</p>
               <p n="N27.18.7">As much as she hath glorified herself, and lived in delicacies, so much
torment and sorrow give ye to her; because she saith in her heart:  I sit a
queen, and am no widow; and sorrow I shall not see.

</p>
               <p n="N27.18.8">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and

               <p n="N27.18.10">Standing afar off for fear of her torments, saying:  Alas!  alas!  that
great city Babylon, that mighty city:  for in one hour is thy judgment come.
